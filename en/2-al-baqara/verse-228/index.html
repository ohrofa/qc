He then came back to me while I had prepared my water (for taking a bath), took off my clothes and closed my door.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar asked Abdullah bin Mas`ud, &#34;What do you think?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I think that she is still his wife, as long as she is not allowed to resume praying (i.e., until the third period ends before he takes her back).&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;This is my opinion too.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Abu Ad-Darda, Ubadah bin As-Samit, Anas bin Malik, Ibn Mas`ud, Mu`adh, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari and Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Furthermore, this is the opinion of Sa`id bin Musayyib, Alqamah, Aswad, Ibrahim, Mujahid, Ata, Tawus, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Sirin, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi, Makhul, Ad-Dahhak and Ata Al-Khurasani. <br /> <br />They all stated that the <b>Quru</b> is the menstruation period. <br /> <br />What testifies to this is the <b>Hadith</b> that Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i reported that Fatimah bint Abu Hubaiysh said that Allah's Messenger said to her&#59; <br /> <br />دَعِي الصَّلَةَ أَيَّامَ أَقْرَايِك <br /> <br />Do not pray during your <b>Aqra</b> (pl. for <b>Quru</b>, the menstruation period). <br /> <br />If this <b>Hadith</b> was authentic, it would have been a clear proof that the <b>Quru</b> is the menstruation period. However, one of the narrators of this <b>Hadith</b>, Al-Mundhir, is an unknown person (in <b>Hadith</b> terminology), as Abu Hatim has stated, although Ibn Hibban has mentioned Al-Mundhir in his book Ath-Thiqat. <br /><b>A Woman's Statement about Menses and Purity is to be accepted</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللّهُ فِي أَرْحَامِهِنَّ <br />and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, <br /> <br />meaning, of pregnancy or menstruation periods. <br /> <br />This is the <b>Tafsir</b> of Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hakam bin Utaybah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak and others. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />إِن كُنَّ يُوْمِنَّ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ <br />if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> warns women against hiding the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), indicating that they are the authority in such matters as they alone know such facts about themselves. Since verifying such matters is difficult, Allah left this decision with them. Yet, women were warned not to hide the truth in case they wish to end the <b>Iddah</b> sooner, or later, according to their desires. Women were thus commanded to say the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), no more and no less. <br /><b>The Husband has the Right to take back his Divorced Wife during the Iddah (Waiting Period)</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُواْ إِصْلَحًا <br /> <br />And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. <br /> <br />Hence, the husband who divorces his wife can take her back, providing she is still in her <b>Iddah</b> (time spent before a divorced woman or a widow can remarry) and that his aim, by taking her back, is righteous and for the purpose of bringing things back to normal. However, this ruling applies where the husband is eligible to take his divorced wife back. <br /> <br />We should mention that (when this <b>Ayah</b> 2&#59;228 was revealed), the ruling that made the divorce thrice and specified when the husband is ineligible to take his divorced wife back, had not been revealed yet. Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed the following <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;229) that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce. <br /><b>The Rights the Spouses have over Each Other</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> <br />And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that the wife has certain rights on her husband, just as he has certain rights on her, and each is obliged to give the other spouse his due rights. <br /> <br />Muslim reported that Jabir said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />فَاتَّقُوا اللهَ فِي النِّسَاءِ فَإِنَّكُمْ أَخَذْتُمُوهُنَّ بِأَمَانَةِ اللهِ وَاسْتَحْلَلْتُمْ فُرُوجَهُنَّ بِكَلِمَةِ اللهِ <br /> <br />Fear Allah regarding your women, for you have taken them by Allah's covenant and were allowed to enjoy with them sexually by Allah's Words. <br /> <br />وَلَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَنْ لَا يُوطِيْنَ فُرُشَكُمْ أَحَدًا تَكْرَهُونَهُ فَإِنْ فَعَلْنَ ذَلِكَ فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ <br /> <br />You have the right on them that they do not allow anyone you dislike to sit on your mat. If they do that, then discipline them leniently. <br /> <br />وَلَهُنَّ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوف <br /> <br />They have the right to be spent on and to be bought clothes in what is reasonable. <br /> <br />Bahz bin Hakim said that Muawiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri related that his grandfather said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah! What is the right the wife of one of us has?&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />أَنْ تُطْعِمَهَا إِذَا طَعِمْتَ وتَكْسُوَهَا إِذَا اكْتَسَيْتَ وَلَا تَضْرِبِ الْوَجْهَ وَلَا تُقَبِّحْ وَلَا تَهْجُرْ إِلاَّ فِي الْبَيْت <br /> <br />To feed her when you eat, buy her clothes when you buy for yourself and to refrain from striking her on the face, cursing her or staying away from her except in the house. <br /> <br />Waki related that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;I like to take care of my appearance for my wife just as I like for her to take care of her appearance for me. <br /> <br />This is because Allah says&#59; <br />وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> (And they (women) have rights similar (to those of their husbands) over them to what is reasonable).&#34; <br /> <br />This statement is reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abu Hatim. <br /><b>The Virtue Men have over Women</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ <br /> <br />but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that men are in a more advantageous position than women physically as well as in their mannerism, status, obedience (of women to them), spending, taking care of the affairs and in general, in this life and in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said (in another <b>Ayah</b>), <br /> <br />الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَأءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَأ أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَلِهِمْ <br /> <br />Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. (4&#59;34) <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكُيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. <br /> <br />means, He is Mighty in His punishment of those who disobey and defy His commands. He is Wise in what He commands, destines and legislates</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>Divorced women shall wait by themselves, before remarrying, for three periods (qur'in is the plural of qar'), of purity or menstruation -- these are two different opinions -- which begin from the moment of divorce. This [stipulation] applies to those who have been sexually penetrated but not to those otherwise, on account of His saying, there shall be no [waiting] period for you to reckon against them [Q. 33&#59;49]. The waiting period for immature or menopausal women is three months; pregnant women, on the other hand, must wait until they give birth, as stated in the srat al-Talq [Q. 65&#59;4], while slavegirls must wait two months, according to the Sunna. And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs, of child or menstruation, if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their mates, their spouses, have a better right to restore them, to bring them back, even if they refuse, in such time, that is, during the waiting period, if they desire to set things right, between them, and put pressure on the woman [to return]; the statement is not a condition for the possibility of return, but an incitement [to set things right] in the case of repealed divorce; the term ahaqq, `better right to', does not denote any priority, since, in any case, no other person has the right to marry them during their waiting period; women shall have rights, due from their spouses, similar to those, rights, due from them, with justice, as stipulated by the Law, in the way of kind conjugality and not being harmed; but their men have a degree above them, in rights, as in their duty to obey their husbands, because of their [the husbands'] payment of a dowry and their [husbands] being the bread-winners; God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in what He has ordained for His creatures.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods.
