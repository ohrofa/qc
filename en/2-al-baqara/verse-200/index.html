There are some people who say, `Our Lord, give to us, our lot, in this world', and they are given it; such people will have no part, no lot, in the Hereafter.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Order for Remembrance of Allah and seeking Good in this Life and the Hereafter upon completing the Rites of Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُم مَّنَاسِكَكُمْ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ابَاءكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا <br /> <br />So when you have accomplished your <b>Manasik</b>, remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with far more remembrance. <br /> <br />Allah commands that He be remembered after the rituals are performed. <br /> <br />كَذِكْرِكُمْ ابَاءكُمْ <br /> (...as you remember your forefathers), <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, people used to stand during the (<b>Hajj</b>) season, and one of them would say, `My father used to feed (the poor), help others (end their disputes, with his money), pay the <b>Diyah</b> (i.e., blood money),' and so forth. The only <b>Dhikr</b> that they had was that they would remember the deeds of their fathers. Allah then revealed to Muhammad&#59; <br />فَاذْكُرُواْ اللّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ابَاءكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا <br /> (Remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with far more remembrance).&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, remembering Allah the Exalted and Ever High is always encouraged. We should mention that when Allah used &#34;or&#34; in the <b>Ayah</b>, He meant to encourage the people to remember Him more than they remember their forefathers, not that the word entails a doubt (as to which is larger or bigger). This statement is similar to the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً <br />as stones or even worse in hardness. (2&#59;74) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً <br />fear men as they fear Allah or even more, (4&#59;77) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْيَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ <br /> <br />And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more. (37&#59;147) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى <br /> <br />And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer. (53&#59;9) <br /> <br />Allah encourages calling Him in supplication after remembering Him, because this will make it more likely that the supplication will be accepted. <br /> <br />Allah also criticizes those who only supplicate to Him about the affairs of this life, while ignoring the affairs of the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا اتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي الاخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَقٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But of mankind there are some who say&#59;&#34;Our Lord! Give us (Your bounties) in this world!&#34; and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />meaning, they have no share in the Hereafter. This criticism serves to discourage other people from imitating those mentioned. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some Bedouins used to come to the standing area (<b>Arafat</b>) and supplicate saying, `O Allah! Make it a rainy year, a fertile year and a year of good child bearing.' They would not mention any of the affairs of the Hereafter. Thus, Allah revealed about them&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا اتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي الاخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَقٍ <br /> <br /> <br />But of mankind there are some who say&#59;&#34;Our Lord! Give us (Your bounties) in this world!&#34; and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter.&#34; <br /> <br />Next, Allah tells</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 199" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-199/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">200</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>200</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 201" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-201/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
