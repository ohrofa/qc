They said, `Now you have brought the truth', that is, [now] you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother, and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not, on account of its excessive cost.

Rather, it is honorable and fair looking. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said that, <br /> <br />مُسَلَّمَةٌ لاَّ شِيَةَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />sound, having no blemish in it.&#34;' <br /> <br />means, &#34;The cow does not suffer from any defects.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Abu Al-Aliyah and Ar-Rabi. <br /> <br />Mujahid also said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> means the cow is free from defects. <br /> <br />Further, Ata' Al-Khurasani said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> means that its legs and body are free of physical defects. <br />... <br />قَالُواْ الانَ جِيْتَ بِالْحَقِّ <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Now you have brought the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said that the <b>Ayah</b>means, <br /> <br />&#34;They did not want to slaughter it.&#34; <br /> <br />This means that even after all the questions and answers about the cow's description, the Jews were still reluctant to slaughter the cow. <br /> <br />This part of the Qur'an criticized the Jews for their behavior, because their only goal was to be stubborn, and this is why they nearly did not slaughter the cow. <br /> <br />Also, Ubaydah, Mujahid, Wahb bin Munabbih, Abu Al-Aliyah and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews bought the cow with a large amount of money.&#34; <br /> <br />There is a difference of opinion over this</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 70" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 72" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
