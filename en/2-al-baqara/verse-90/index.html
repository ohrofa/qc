And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Evil is that for which they sell their souls, that is, their share of the reward [in the Hereafter] (bi'sam, `evil is that [for] which'&#59; m here is an indefinite particle, representing `a thing', and constitutes a specification qualifying the subject of [the verb] bi's, `evil is', the very thing being singled out for criticism); that they disbelieve in that, Qur'n, which God has revealed, grudging (baghyan here is an object denoting reason for yakfur, `they disbelieve'), that is, out of envy, that God should reveal (read either yunzil or yunazzil) of His bounty, the Inspiration, to whomever He will of His servants, to deliver the Message; and they were laden, they returned, with anger, from God for their disbelief in what He has revealed (the indefinite form, bi- ghadabin, `with anger', is used to emphasise the awesomeness [of the `anger']), upon anger, which they deserved formerly, when they neglected the Torah and disbelieved in Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah said, <br /> <br />بِيْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَا أنَزَلَ اللّهُ بَغْياً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves, that they should disbelieve in that which Allah has revealed (the Qur'an), <br /> <br />Mujahid said that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />بِيْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ <br /> (How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves), means <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews sold the truth for falsehood and hid the truth about Muhammad.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />بِيْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ <br /> (How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves) means, <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews sold themselves.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, what is worse is what they chose for themselves by disbelieving in what Allah revealed to Muhammad instead of believing, aiding and supporting him. This behavior of theirs is the result of their injustice, envy and hatred, <br /> <br />أَن يُنَزِّلُ اللّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَاء مِنْ عِبَادِهِ <br /> <br />grudging that Allah should reveal of His grace unto whom He wills of His servants.&#34; <br /> <br />There is no envy worse than this. <br /> <br />Therefore, <br /> <br />فَبَأوُواْ بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ <br /> <br />So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah became angry with them because they ignored some of the <b>Tawrah</b> and disbelieved in the Prophet that He sent to them.&#34; <br /> <br />I (Ibn Kathir) say that; <br /> <br />the meaning of, <br />بَأوُواْ <br /> (And they drew on themselves) is that they deserved and acquired multiplied anger. <br /> <br />Also, Abu Al-Aliyah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah became angry with them, because of their disbelief in the <b>Injil</b> and `Isa and He became angry with them again, because they disbelieved in Muhammad and the Qur'an.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ikrimah and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment. <br /> <br />Since their disbelief was a result of their transgression and envy, which was caused by arrogance, they were punished with disgrace and humiliation in this world and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ <br /> <br />Verily, those who scorn My worship (i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness) they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#34; (40&#59;60), <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;Disgraced, degraded and humiliated.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad narrated that Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />يُحْشَرُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَمْثَالَ الذَّرِّ فِي صُوَرِ النَّاسِ يَعْلُوهُمْ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الصِّغَارِ حَتَّى يَدْخُلُوا سِجْنًا فِي جَهَنَّمَ يُقَالُ لَهُ بَوْلَسُ تَعْلُوهُمْ نَارُ الاَْنْيَارِ يُسْقَونَ مِنْ طِينَةِ الْخَبَالِ عُصَارَةِ أَهْلِ النَّار <br /> <br />The arrogant people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the size of ants, but in the shape of men. Everything shall be above them, because of the humiliation placed on them, until they enter a prison in <b>Jahannam</b> called `<b>Bawlas</b>' where the fire will surround them from above. They shall drink from the puss of the people of the Fire</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 89" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-89/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">90</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>90</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 91" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-91/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
