and you can never do it, <br /> <br />indicating that they will never be able to answer the challenge. <br /> <br />This is another miracle, in that, Allah clearly stated without doubt that the Qur'an will never be opposed or challenged by anything similar to it, for eternity. This is a true statement that has not been changed until the present and shall never change. <br /> <br />How can anyone be able to produce something like the Qur'an, when the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who created everything! <br /> <br />How can the words of the created ever be similar to the Words of the Creator! <br /><b>Examples of the Miracle of the Qur'an</b> <br /> <br />Whoever reads through the Qur'an will realize that it contains various levels of superiority through both the apparent and hidden meanings that it mentions. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />الر كِتَابٌ أُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ <br /><b>Alif Lam Ra</b>. (This is) a Book, the verses whereof are perfect (in every sphere of knowledge, etc.), and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is Wise and well-acquainted (with all things). (11&#59;1) <br /> <br />So the expressions in the Qur'an are perfect and its meanings are explained. Further, every word and meaning in the Qur'an is eloquent and cannot be surpassed. The Qur'an also mentioned the stories of the people of the past; and these accounts and stories occurred exactly as the Qur'an stated. Also, the Qur'an commanded every type of righteousness and forbade every type of evil, just as Allah stated, <br /> <br />وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً <br /> <br />And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. (6&#59;115) <br /> <br />meaning, true in the stories it narrates and just in its Laws. <br /> <br />The Qur'an is true, just and full of guidance. It does not contain exaggerations, lies or falsehood, unlike Arabic and other types of poems that contained lies. These poems, conform with the popular statement, <br /> <br />&#34;The most eloquent speech is the one that contains the most lies!&#34; <br /> <br />Sometimes, one would find a long poem that mainly contains descriptions of women, horses or alcohol. Or, the poem might contain praise or the description of a certain person, horse, camel, war, incident, fear, lion, or other types of items and objects. Such praise or descriptions do not bring any benefit, except shed light on the poet's ability to clearly and eloquently describe such items. Yet, one will only be able to find one or two sentences in many long poems that elaborate on the main theme of the poem, while the rest of the poem contains insignificant descriptions and repetitions. <br /> <br />As for the Qur'an, it is entirely eloquent in the most perfect manner, as those who have knowledge in such matters and understand Arabic methods of speech and expressions concur. <br /> <br />When one reads through the stories in the Qur'an, he will find them fruitful, whether they were in extended or short forms, repeated or not. The more these stories are repeated, the more fruitful and beautiful they become. The Qur'an does not become old when one repeats reciting it, nor do the scholars ever get bored with it. <br /> <br />When the Qur'an mentions the subject of warning and promises, it presents truths that would make solid, firm mountains shake, so what about the comprehending, understanding hearts! When the Qur'an promises, it opens the hearts and the ears, making them eager to attain the abode of peace - Paradise - and to be the neighbors of the Throne of the Most Beneficent. <br /> <br />For instance, on the subject of promises and encouragement, the Qur'an said, <br /> <br />فَلَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّأ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَاءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br />No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do. (32&#59;17) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ <br /> <br />(There will be) therein all that inner selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever. (43&#59;71) <br /> <br />On the subject of warning and discouragement; <br /> <br />أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ الْبَرِّ <br /> <br />Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up! (17&#59;68) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />أَءَمِنتُمْ مَّن فِى السَّمَأءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَمُورُ <br /> <br />أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ مِّن فِى السَّمَأءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَـصِباً فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ <br /> <br />Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake! <br /> <br />Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind! Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My warning. (67&#59;16-17) <br /> <br />On the subject of threats, the Qur'an said, <br /> <br />فَكُلًّ أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ <br /> <br />So We punished each (of them) for his sins. (29&#59;40) <br /> <br />Also, on the subject of soft advice, the Qur'an said, <br /> <br />أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ <br /> <br />ثُمَّ جَأءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ <br /> <br />مَأ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ <br /> <br />Tell Me, (even) if We do let them enjoy for years. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them. (26&#59;205-207). <br /> <br />There are many other examples of the eloquence, beauty, and benefits of the Qur'an. <br /> <br />When the Qur'an is discussing Laws, commandments and prohibitions, it commands every type of righteous, good, pleasing and beneficial act. It also forbids every type of evil, disliked and amoral act. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud and other scholars of the Salaf said, <br /> <br />&#34;When you hear what Allah said in the Qur'an, such as, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ <br /></b> O you who believe! then listen with full attention, for it either contains a type of righteousness that Allah is enjoining, or an evil that He is forbidding.&#34; <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />يَأْمُرُهُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَـهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَـيِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالاٌّغْلَـلَ الَّتِى كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />He (Muhammad) commands them for <b>Al-Ma`ruf</b> (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from <b>Al-Munkar</b> (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful <b>At-Tayyibat</b>(i.e. all good and lawful things), and prohibits them as unlawful <b>Al-Khaba'ith</b> (i.e. all evil and unlawful things), he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. (7&#59;157) <br /> <br />When the <b>Ayat</b> mention Resurrection and the horrors that will occur on that Day, and Paradise and the Fire and the joys and safe refuge that Allah prepared for His loyal friends, or torment and Hell for His enemies, these <b>Ayat</b> contain glad tidings or warnings. The <b>Ayat</b> then call to perform good deeds and avoid evil deeds, making the life of this world less favorable and the Hereafter more favorable. They also establish the correct methods and guide to Allah's straight path and just legislation, all the while ridding the hearts of the evil of the cursed devil. <br /><b>The Qur'an is the Greatest Miracle given to the Prophet</b> <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> record that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ مِنَ الاْاَنْبِيَاءِ إِلاَّ قَدْ أُعْطِيَ مِنَ الايَاتِ مَا امَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ وَإنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُه وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Every Prophet was given a miracle, the type of which brings mankind to faith. What I was given is a revelation that Allah sent down to me. Yet, I hope that I will have the most following on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />This is the wording narrated by Muslim. <br /> <br />The Prophet stated that among the Prophets he was given a revelation, meaning, he was especially entrusted with the miraculous Qur'an that challenged mankind to produce something similar to it. As for the rest of the divinely revealed Books, they were not miraculous according to many scholars. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />The Prophet was also aided with innumerable signs and indications that testify to the truth of his Prophethood and what he was sent with, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. <br /><b>Meaning of `Stones</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers. <br /> <br />`Fuel' is wood or similar substances, used to start and feed a fire. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا الْقَـسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً <br /> <br />And as for the <b>Qasitun</b> (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell. (72&#59;15) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ <br /> <br />لَوْ كَانَ هَـوُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ <br /> <br />Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you enter it. <br /> <br />Had these (idols) been <b>alihah</b> (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein. (21&#59;98-99) <br /> <br />The stones mentioned here are the giant, rotten, black, sulfuric stones that become the hottest when heated, may Allah save us from this evil end. <br /> <br />It was also reported that the stones mentioned here are the idols and rivals that were worshipped instead of Allah, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ <br /> <br />Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (21&#59;28) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ <br /> (prepared for the disbelievers), <br /> <br />It appears most obvious that it refers to the Fire that is fueled by men and stones, and it also may refer to the stones themselves. <br /> <br />There is no contradiction between these two views, because they are dependent upon each other. <br /> <br />`Prepared' means, <br /> <br />it is `kept' and will surely touch those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq narrated that Muhammad said that Ikrimah or Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn Abbas said, <br />أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ <br /> (prepared for the disbelievers), <br /> <br />&#34;For those who embrace the disbelief that you (disbelievers) have embraced.&#34; <br /><b>Jahannam (Hellfire) exists now</b> <br /> <br />Many of the Imams of the <b>Sunnah</b> used this <b>Ayah</b> to prove that the Fire exists now. This is because Allah said, <br />أُعِدَّتْ <br /> (prepared) meaning, prepared and kept. <br /> <br />There are many <b>Hadiths</b> on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />تَحَاجَّتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّار <br /> <br />Paradise and the Fire had an argument.. <br /> <br />Also, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />اسْتَأْذَنَتِ النَّارُ رَبَّهَا فَقَالَتْ رَبِّ أَكَلَ بَعضِي بَعْضًا فَأذِنَ لَهَا بِنَفَسَيْنِ نَفَسٍ فِي الشِّتَاءِ وَنَفَسٍ فِي الصَّيْف <br /> <br />The Fire sought the permission of her Lord. She said, 'O my Lord! Some parts of me consumed the other parts.' And Allah allowed her two periods to exhale, one in winter and one in summer. <br /> <br />Also, there is a Hadith recorded from Ibn Mas`ud that the Companions heard the sound of a falling object. When they asked about it, the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />هَذَا حَجَرٌ أُلْقِيَ بِهِ مِنْ شَفِيرِ جَهَنَّمَ مُنْذُ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً الاْنَ وَصَلَ إِلى قَعْرِهَا <br /> <br />This is a stone that was thrown from the top of <b>Jahannam</b> seventy years ago, but only now reached its bottom. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is in <b>Sahih</b> Muslim. <br /> <br />There are many <b>Hadiths</b> that are <b>Mutawatir</b> (narrated by many different chains of narrations) on this subject, such as the <b>Hadiths</b> about the eclipse prayer, the night of <b>Isra</b> etc. <br /> <br />Allah's statements, <br />فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ <br /> (Then produce a <b>Surah</b> of the like thereof) (2&#59;23), and, <b> <br />بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ <br /></b> (A <b>Surah</b> like it) (10&#59;38), <br /> <br />this includes the short and long <b>Surahs</b> of the Qur'an. Therefore, the challenge to creation stands with regards to both the long and short <b>Surahs</b>, and there is no disagreement that I know of on this fact between the scholars of old and new. <br /> <br />Before he became Muslim, Amr bin Al-`As met Musaylimah the Liar who asked him, &#34;What has recently been revealed to your fellow (meaning Muhammad) in Makkah?&#34; <br /> <br />Amr said, &#34;A short, yet eloquent <b>Surah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />He asked, &#34;What is it?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />وَالْعَصْرِ <br /> <br />إِنَّ الاِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ <br /> <br />By <b>Al-`Asr</b> (the time). Verily, man is in loss, (103&#59;1-2) <br /> <br />Musaylimah thought for a while and said, &#34;A similar <b>Surah</b> was also revealed to me.&#34; <br /> <br />Amr asked, &#34;What is it?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;O <b>Wabr</b>, O <b>Wabr</b> (i.e. a wild cat), you are but two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is unworthy and thin.&#34; <br /> <br />Amr said, &#34;By Allah! You know that I know that you are lying.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>And if you do not, do what was mentioned because you are incapable, and you will not (a parenthetical statement), that is, never [will you be able to], because of its inimitability, then fear, through belief in God and [belief] that this is not the words of a human, the Fire, whose fuel is men, disbelievers, and stones, like their very idols, indicating that its heat is extreme, since it burns with the [stones] mentioned, unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared, and made ready, for disbelievers, so that they are punished in it (this [phrase, u`iddat li'l-kfirna, `prepared for disbelievers'] is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier).</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 23" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> البقرة <span class="num-ar">2</span> : <span class="num-ar">24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah <span>2</span>:<span>24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 25" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
