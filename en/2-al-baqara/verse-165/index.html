The general meaning [of the verse] then is&#59; `If they were aware in this world of the severity of God's chastisement and of the fact that power is God's alone, the moment they come to see it with their own eyes, on the Day of Resurrection, they would not take to themselves compeers'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Condition of the Polytheists in this Life and the Hereafter</b> <br /> <br />In these <b>Ayat</b>, Allah mentions the condition of the polytheists in this life and their destination in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ أَندَاداً يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ اللّهِ <br /> <br />And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. <br /> <br />They appointed equals and rivals with Allah, worshipping them along with Allah and loving them, just as they love Allah. However, Allah is the only deity worthy of worship, Who has neither rival nor opponent nor partner. <br /> <br />It is reported in the <b>Sahihayn</b> that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said&#59; <br /> <br />I said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! What is the greatest sin&#34; He said&#59; <br /> <br />أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك <br /> <br />To appoint a rival to Allah while He Alone has created you. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِّلّهِ <br /> <br />But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else). <br /> <br />Because these believers love Allah, know His greatness, revere Him, believe in His Oneness, then they do not associate anything or anyone with Him in the worship. Rather, they worship Him Alone, depend on Him and they seek help from Him for each and every need. <br /> <br />Then, Allah warns those who commit <b>Shirk</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ يَرَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ أَنَّ الْقُوَّةَ لِلّهِ جَمِيعاً <br /> <br />If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to Allah. <br /> <br />if these people knew what they will face and the terrible punishment they are to suffer because of their disbelief and <b>Shirk</b> (polytheism), then they would shun the deviation that they live by. <br /> <br />وَأَنَّ اللّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and that Allah is severe in punishment. <br /> <br />Allah mentions their false beliefs in their idols, and that those they followed will declare their innocence of them. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 164" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-164/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">165</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>165</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 166" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-166/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=165;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
