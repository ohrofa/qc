These are days of eating and drinking. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Nubayshah Al-Hudhali said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وشُرْبٍ وَذِكْرِ الله <br /> <br />The days of <b>Tashriq</b> are days of eating, drinking and <b>Dhikr</b> (remembering) of Allah.) <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />We also mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> of Jubayr bin Mut`im&#59; <br /> <br />عَرَفَةُ كُلُّهَا مَوْقِفٌ وَأيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح <br /> <br />All of <b>Arafat</b> is a standing place and all of the days of Tashriq are days of Sacrifice. <br /> <br />We also mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> by Abdur-Rahman bin Ya`mar Ad-Diyli&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَيَّامُ مِنىً ثَلَأثَةٌ فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَأ إثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَأ إِثْمَ عَلَيْه <br /> <br />The days of <b>Mina</b> (<b>Tashriq</b>) are three. <br /> <br />Those who hasten in two days then there is no sin in it, and those who delay (i.e., remain in <b>Mina</b> for a third day) then there is no sin in it.) <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أيَّامُ طُعْمٍ وَذِكْرِ الله <br /> <br />The days of <b>Tashriq</b> are days of eating and remembering Allah. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger sent Abdullah bin Hudhayfah to <b>Mina</b> proclaiming&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تَصُومُوا هذِه الاْاَيَّامَ فَإنَّهَا أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وَشُرْبٍ وَذِكْرِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />Do not fast these days (i.e., <b>Tashriq</b> days), for they are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /><b>The Appointed Days</b> <br /> <br />Miqsam said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the Appointed Days are the days of <b>Tashriq</b>, four days&#59;the day of the Sacrifice (10th of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>) and three days after that. <br /> <br />This opinion was also reported of Ibn Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Musa, Ata, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Yahya bin Abu Kathir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ata Al-Khurasani, Malik bin Anas, and others. <br /> <br />In addition, the apparent meaning of the following Ayah supports this opinion&#59; <br />فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَل إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him). <br /> <br />So the <b>Ayah</b> hints to the three days after the day of Sacrifice. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرُواْ اللّهَ فِي أَيَّامٍ مَّعْدُودَاتٍ <br /> <br />And remember Allah during the Appointed Days, <br /> <br />directs remembering Allah upon slaughtering the animals, after the prayers, and by <b>Dhikr</b> (supplication) in general. <br /> <br />It also includes <b>Takbir</b> and remembering Allah while throwing the pebbles every day during the <b>Tashriq</b> days. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> that Abu Dawud and several others collected states&#59; <br /><b>Tawaf</b> around the House, <b>Sa`i</b> between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> and throwing the pebbles were legislated so that Allah is remembered in <b>Dhikr</b>. <br /> <br />فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَل إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ <br />لِمَنِ اتَّقَى <br /> <br />But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good <br /> <br />When mentioning the first procession (refer to 2&#59;199) and the second procession of the people upon the end of the <b>Hajj</b> season, when they start to return to their areas, after they had gathered during the rituals and at the standing places, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and obey Allah (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ <br /> <br />And it is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered back.
