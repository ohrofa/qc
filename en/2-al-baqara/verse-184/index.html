It is also said that the [l] negation of the verb [yutqnahu] is not actually implied, because at the very beginning of Islam, they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast [as an obligation], where God says, So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it [Q. 2&#59;185]&#59; Ibn `Abbs said [by way of qualification] `Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding, if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two, the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated'). For him who volunteers good, by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that, volunteering, is good for him; but that you should fast (wa-an tasm is the subject) is better for you (khayrun lakum is its predicate), than breaking the fast and paying the redemption, if you but knew, that this is better for you, then do it.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ <br /> <br />Fast for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. <br /> <br />Allah states that the fast occurs during a fixed number of days, so that it does not become hard on the hearts, thereby weakening their resolve and endurance. <br /><b>The various Stages of Fasting</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;(The day of) `<b>Ashura</b>' was a day of fasting. When the obligation to fast Ramadan was revealed, those who wished fasted, and those who wished did not.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded the same from Ibn `Umar and Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ <br />those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a <b>Miskin</b> (poor person) (for every day). <br /> <br />Mu`adh commented, <br /> <br />&#34;In the beginning, those who wished, fasted and those who wished, did not fast and fed a poor person for each day.&#34; <br /> <br />Al- Bukhari recorded Salamah bin Al-Akwa saying that; <br /> <br />when the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, those who did not wish to fast, used to pay the <b>Fidyah</b> (feeding a poor person for each day they did not fast) until the following <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;185) was revealed abrogating the previous <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />It was also reported from Ubaydullah from Nafi that Ibn Umar said; <br /> <br />&#34;It was abrogated.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi reported that Murrah narrated that Abdullah said about this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It means `those who find it difficult (to fast).' Formerly, those who wished, fasted and those who wished, did not but fed a poor person instead.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا <br /> <br />But whoever does good of his own accord, <br /> <br />meaning whoever fed an extra poor person. <br /> <br />فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ وَأَن تَصُومُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know. <br /> <br />Later the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ <br /> (So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of <b>Ramadan</b>, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe <b>Sawm</b> (fasting) that month) (2&#59;185) was revealed and this abrogated the previous <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;184). <br /><b>The Fidyah (Expiation) for breaking the Fast is for the Old and the Ailing</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that; <br /> <br />Ata heard Ibn Abbas recite&#59; <br />وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ <br /> (And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day). Ibn Abbas then commented, <br /> <br />&#34;(This <b>Ayah</b>) was not abrogated, it is for the old man and the old woman who are able to fast with difficulty, but choose instead to feed a poor person for every day (they do not fast).&#34; <br /> <br />Others reported that Sa`id bin Jubayr mentioned this from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />So the abrogation here applies to the healthy person, who is not traveling and who has to fast, as Allah said&#59; <br />فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ <br /> (So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe <b>Sawm</b> (fasting) that month. (2&#59;185) <br /> <br />As for the old man (and woman) who cannot fast, <br /> <br />he is allowed to abstain from fasting and does not have to fast another day instead, because he is not likely to improve and be able to fast other days. So he is required to pay a <b>Fidyah</b> for every day missed. <br /> <br />This is the opinion of Ibn Abbas and several others among the <b>Salaf</b> who read the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ <br /> (And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man)), to mean those who find it difficult to fast as Ibn Mas`ud stated. <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Al-Bukhari who said, <br /> <br />&#34;As for the old man (person) who cannot fast, (he should do like) Anas who, for one or two years after he became old fed some bread and meat to a poor person for each day he did not fast.&#34; <br /> <br />This point, which Al-Bukhari attributed to Anas without a chain of narrators, was collected with a continuous chain of narrators by Abu Ya`la Mawsuli in his Musnad, that Ayub bin Abu Tamimah said; <br /> <br />&#34;Anas could no longer fast. So he made a plate of <b>Tharid</b> (broth, bread and meat) and invited thirty poor persons and fed them.&#34; <br /> <br />The same ruling applies for the pregnant and breast-feeding women if they fear for themselves or their children or fetuses. In this case, they pay the <b>Fidyah</b> and do not have to fast other days in place of the days that they missed</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 183" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-183/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">184</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>184</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 185" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-185/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=184;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
