Look at your food, the figs, and drink, the cup of juice, it has not spoiled, despite the length of time (the final h' of yatasannah, `to spoil', is said to belong to the original root, s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent, in which case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final h'); and look at your ass, how it is, and he saw that it had died, and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would know and, so that We would make you a sign, of [the truth of] the Resurrection, for the people. And look at the bones, of the ass, how We shall set them up, how We shall raise them back to life (nunshiruh, or nanshiruh, derived from the two expressions, nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuh, meaning `How We shall move it and make it stand'); and then clothe them with flesh', and when he looked at it, he saw that [the bones] had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh, and that the Spirit had been breathed into it, making it bray. So, when it was made clear to him, as a result of witnessing it, he said, `I know (a variant reading for a`lam, `I know', has [the imperative] i`lam, `know!', thus making it a command from God), with the knowledge of direct vision, that God has power over all things'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Story of Uzayr</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ <br /> <br />إِلَى الَّذِي حَأجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رِبِّهِ <br /></b> (Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord) means, &#34;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord!&#34; <br /> <br />Then, Allah connected the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />أَوْ كَالَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَى قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br /> <br />Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs, <br /> <br />to the <b>Ayah</b> above by using `or'. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ali bin Abi Talib said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> meant Uzayr. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah. <br /> <br />Mujahid bin Jabr said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people. <br /> <br />وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ <br /> (in ruin) means, <br /> <br />it became empty of people. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br /> (up to its roofs) <br /> <br />indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. <br /> <br />Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. <br /> <br />قَالَ أَنَّىَ يُحْيِـي هَـَذِهِ اللّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death! <br /> <br />because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. <br /> <br />فَأَمَاتَهُ اللّهُ مِيَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ <br /> <br />So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). <br /> <br />The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. When Allah resurrected Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body. When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel, <br /> <br />قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;How long did you remain (dead)!&#34; He (the man) said&#59;&#34;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#34; <br /> <br />The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said, <br />أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> (&#34;Or part of a day&#34;). <br /> <br />قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِيَةَ عَامٍ فَانظُرْ إِلَى طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#34; <br /> <br />He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot. <br /> <br />وَانظُرْ إِلَى حِمَارِكَ <br /> <br />And look at your donkey! <br /> <br />&#34;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ ايَةً لِّلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And thus We have made of you a sign for the people, <br /> <br />that Resurrection occurs. <br /> <br />وَانظُرْ إِلَى العِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا <br /> <br />Look at the bones, how We <b>Nunshizuha</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, collect them and put them back together. <br /> <br />In his <b>Mustadrak</b>, Al-Hakim, recorded that; <br /> <br />Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا <br /> (how We <b>Nunshizuha</b>). <br /> <br />Al-Hakim said; &#34;Its chain is <b>Sahih</b> and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> was also read, <b> <br />نُنشِرُهَا <br /></b> &#34;<b>Nunshiruha</b>&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا <br /> <br />And clothe them with flesh. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys' nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah's leave.&#34; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ <br /> <br />When this was clearly shown to him, <br /> <br />All this occurred while Uzayr was watching, and this is when he proclaimed, <br /> <br />قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ اللّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 258" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-258/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">259</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>259</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 260" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-260/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
