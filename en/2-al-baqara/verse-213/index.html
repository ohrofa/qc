We are the first people to enter Paradise, although they (Jews and Christians) have been given the Book before us and we after them. Allah has guided us to the truth wherever they disputed over it. This is the day (Friday) that they disputed about, Allah guided us to it. So, the people follow us, as tomorrow is for the Jews and the day after is for the Christians. <br /> <br />Ibn Wahb related that Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that his father said about the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />فَهَدَى اللّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لِمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ <br /> (Then Allah by His leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed), <br /> <br />&#34;They disputed about the day of Congregation (Friday). The Jews made it Saturday while the Christians chose Sunday. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to Friday. <br /> <br />They also disputed about the true <b>Qiblah</b>. The Christians faced the east while the Jews faced <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the true <b>Qiblah</b> (<b>Ka`bah</b> in Makkah). <br /> <br />They also disputed about the prayer, as some of them bow down, but do not prostrate, while others prostrate, but do not bow down. Some of them pray while talking and some while walking. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about the fast; some of them fast during a part of the day, while others fast from certain types of foods. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about Ibrahim. The Jews said, `He was a Jew,' while the Christians considered him Christian. Allah has made him a <b>Haniyfan Musliman</b>. Allah has guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about `Isa. The Jews rejected him and accused his mother of a grave sin, while the Christians made him a god and the son of God. Allah made him by His Word and a spirit from (those He created) Him. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />بِإِذْنِهِ <br />by His leave, <br /> <br />According to Ibn Jarir meaning, <br /> <br />`By His knowledge of them and by what He has directed and guided them to.' <br /> <br />Also&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />And Allah guides whom He wills, <br /> <br />means from among His creation. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br /> <br />to the straight way. <br /> <br />meaning, He commands the decision and the clear proof. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that Aishah narrated that; <br /> <br />when Allah's Messenger used to wake up at night to pray, he would say&#59; <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ ربَّ جِبْرَايِيلَ وَمِيكَايِيلَ وَإِسْرَافِيلَ فَاطِرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ أَنْتَ تَحْكُمُ بيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ اهْدِنِي لِمَا اخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِكَ إِنَّكَ تَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَاءُ إِلى صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيم <br /> <br />O Allah, the Lord of (angels) Jibril, Mikhail and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen. You judge between Your servants regarding what they have disputed in, so guide me to what have been the subject of dispute of the truth by Your leave. Indeed, You guide whom You will to the straight path. <br /> <br />A <b>Du`a</b> (supplication) reads&#59; <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ أَرِنَا الْحَقَّ حَقًّا وَارْزُقْنَا اتِّبَاعَهُ وَأَرِنَا الْبَاطِلَ بَاطِلً وَارْزُقْنَا اجْتنِاَبَهُ وَلَا تَجْعَلْهُ مُلْتَبِسًا عَلَيْنَا فَنَضِلَّ وَاجْعَلْنَا لِلْمُتَّقِينَ إِمَامًا <br /> <br />O Allah!
