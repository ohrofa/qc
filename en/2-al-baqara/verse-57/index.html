One of them would collect enough for that particular day, for if it remained more than that, it would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, one would collect enough for the sixth and the seventh day, which was the <b>Sabbath</b> during which one would not leave home to seek his livelihood, or for anything else. All this occurred in the wilderness. <br /> <br />The type of <b>manna</b> that we know provides sufficient food when eaten alone, because it is nutritious and sweet. When <b>manna</b> is mixed with water, it becomes a sweet drink. It also changes composition when mixed with other types of food. However, this is not the only type. <br /> <br />The evidence to this fact is that Al-Bukhari narrated, that Sa'd bin Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاوُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن <br /><b>Kam'ah</b> (truffles) is a type of <b>manna</b>, and its liquid is a remedy for the eyes. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Imam Ahmad. <br /> <br />The group of <b>Hadith</b> compilers, with the exception of Abu Dawud, also collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it <b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الْعَجْوَةُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَفِيهَا شِفَاءٌ مِنَ السُّمِّ <br /> <br />وَالْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاوُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن <br /> <br />The <b>Ajwah</b> (pressed, dried date) is from Paradise and it cures poison, <br /><b>Al-Kam'ah</b> (truffles) is a form of <b>manna</b>, and its liquid heals the eye.&#34; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi is the only one of them who recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />As for the quail (<b>Salwa</b>) in question, Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The (<b>Salwa</b>) is a bird that looks like the quail.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the same opinion reported from Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas, may Allah have mercy upon them. <br /> <br />Also, Ikrimah said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Salwa</b> is a bird in Paradise about the size of a sparrow. <br /> <br />Qatadah said ; <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Salwa</b> is a bird that is similar to a sparrow. During that time, an Israelite could catch as many quails as was sufficient for that particular day, otherwise the meat would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, he would collect what is enough for the sixth and the seventh day, the <b>Sabbath</b>, during which one was not allowed to depart his home to seek anything.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ <br /> <br />Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you, <br /> <br />this form of command is a simple order of allowance, guiding to what is good. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُواْ لَهُ <br /> <br />Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him. (34&#59;15) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves, <br /> <br />means, `We commanded them to eat from what We gave them, and to perform the acts of worship (but they rebelled).' <br /> <br />Yet, the Children of Israel rebelled, disbelieved and committed injustice against themselves, even though they saw the clear signs, tremendous miracles and extraordinary events. <br /><b>The Virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the Companions of all Other Prophets</b> <br /> <br />Here it is important to point out the virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the companions of the other Prophets. This includes firmness in the religion, patience and the lack of arrogance, may Allah be pleased with them. <br /> <br />Although the Companions accompanied the Prophet in his travels and battles, such as during the battle of Tabuk, in intense heat and hardship, they did not ask for a miracle, though this was easy for the Prophet by Allah's leave. And when the Companions became hungry, they merely asked the Prophet - to invoke Allah - for an increase in the amount of food. They collected whatever food they had and brought it to the Prophet, and he asked Allah to bless it, told each of them to take some food, and they filled every pot they had. <br /> <br />Also, when they needed rain, the Prophet asked Allah to send down rain, and a rain cloud came. They drank, gave water to their camels and filled their water skins. When they looked around, they found that the cloud had only rained on their camp. This is the best example of those who were willing to accept Allah's decision and follow the Messenger of Allah</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 56" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-56/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">57</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>57</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 58" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=57;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
