And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation [i.e., the debtor] dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses – so that if one of them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness.

When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.[[ Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing and giving testimony before a judge. Verse {2&#58;282} talks about witnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Ramaḍân is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or ḥadîth) from the Prophet (ﷺ). An authentic ḥadîth is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see {24&#58;6}-10). In some cases, only women’s testimony is accepted while men’s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman’s pregnancy or virginity. ]] The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.</p></div></div></article><article id="ruwwad-translation-center" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#ruwwad-translation-center"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>3</span> Ruwwad Translation Center</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>O you who believe, when you contract a debt among yourselves for a fixed period of time, write it down, and let the scribe write it between you with fairness.

And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men, then one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of, that if one of the two women errs the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever they are summoned. And be not loth to write it down, whether it be small or great, with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight, more upright for testimony, and likelier that you will not be in doubt. Unless it be merchandise present that you give and take between you; then it shall be no fault in you if you do not write it down. And take witnesses when you are trafficking one with another.

Unless it is present merchandise that you circulate between you; then no guilt shall be on you if you do not write it down and take witnesses when you are selling, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness. If you do, that is a transgression in you. Fear Allah. Allah teaches you, and Allah has knowledge of everything.</p></div></div></article><article id="mubarakpuri" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#mubarakpuri"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>23</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>O you who believe!

And if the debtor be a fool, a squanderer, or weak, not up to dictating on account of old age or immaturity, or unable to dictate himself, on account of being dumb, or not knowing the language and so forth, then let his guardian, the one in charge of his affairs, be it a parent, an executor, a custodian or an interpreter, dictate justly. And summon to bear witness, the debt, two witnesses, men, mature Muslim free men; or if the two, witnesses, be not men, then one man and two women, to bear witness, such witnesses as you approve of, on account of their piety and probity; the number of women is because of the fact, so that if one of the two women errs, forgets the testimony, given their lesser astuteness and accuracy; the other, the one remembering, will remind her (read fa-tudhakkira or fa-tudhkira), the one that has forgotten -- the `reminding' clause is the reason [for the choice of two women], that is to say, so that she may be reminded if she errs or strays into error, because this [forgetfulness] is the cause of it (a variant reading [for an, `that'] has the conditional in, `if', with [the verb inflected as] tudhakkiru, `she will remind', making it a new sentence, the response to which [follows]); and let the witnesses not refuse, whenever (the m of idh m, `whenever', is extra) they are summoned, to bear witness and take responsibility for the testimony; and be not disdainful, lazy, to write it down, that which you have witnessed in truth (for this frequently occurred), be it, small or great, a little or much, with its term, that is, the date on which it is due (il ajlihi is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [pronominal suffix] h' of taktub-hu, `you write it down'); that, writing down, is more equitable, more just, in God's sight, more upright for testimony, that is to say, [that is] more helpful in summoning witness, because it contains the reminder; and nearer, closer to attaining [the desired state] that you will not be in doubt, with regard to the amount and the due dates; unless it be, [that] there is, trade carried out there and then (tijratun hdiratun&#59; a variant reading has tijratan hdiratan, in which case the nominal sentence is missing its subject, and must be the pronoun for tijra, `trade', that is, hiya, `it [fem. pronoun]') that you give and take between you, without there being a time- frame, then you will not be at fault if you do not write it, the merchandise itself, down. And take witnesses, over it, when you are trading with one another, for this is a better means of preventing dispute. The provisions here are delegated (to the personal choice of the people involved). And let not either writer or witness, the creditor and the debtor, be pressed, to distorting [the agreement], being prevented from testimony or dictation; nor should the creditor press them by charging them with what is not suitable for the testimony or the dictation; and if you do, what is prohibited to you, that is sinfulness, a rebellion against obedience, and lack of truth, in you.

When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down, <br /> <br />directs Allah's believing servants to record their business transactions when their term is delayed, to preserve the terms and timing of these transactions, and the memory of witnesses, as mentioned at the end of the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللّهِ وَأَقْومُ لِلشَّهَادَةِ وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ <br /> (that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves). <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger came to Al-Madinah, while the people were in the habit of paying in advance for fruits to be delivered within one or two years. The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَسْلَفَ فَلْيُسْلِفْ فِي كَيْلٍ مَعْلُومٍ وَوَزْنٍ مَعْلُومٍ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مَعْلُوم <br /> <br />Whoever pays money in advance (for dates to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified measure and weight (of the dates) for a specified date. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />فَاكْتُبُوهُ <br /> (write it down), <br /> <br />is a command from Him to record such transactions to endorse and preserve their terms. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever borrowed should write the terms, and whoever bought should have witnesses.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Sa`id, Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Al-Hasan, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said that; <br /> <br />recording such transactions was necessary before, but was then abrogated by Allah's statement, <br />فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُوَدِّ الَّذِي اوْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللّهَ رَبَّهُ <br /> (Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully). (2&#59;283) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِالْعَدْلِ <br /> <br />Let a scribe write it down in justice between you, <br /> <br />and in truth. Therefore, the scribe is not allowed to cheat any party of the contract and is to only record what the parties of the contract agreed to, without addition or deletion. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ <br /> <br />Let not the scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him, so let him write, <br /> <br />means, &#34;Those who know how to write should not refrain from writing transaction contracts when asked to do so.&#34; <br /> <br />Further, let writing such contracts be a type of charity from the scribe for those who are not lettered, just as Allah taught him what he knew not. Therefore, let him write, just as the Hadith stated, <br /> <br />إِنَّ مِنَ الصَّدَقَةِ أَنْ تُعِينَ صَانِعًا أَوْ تَصْنَعَ لاَِخْرَق <br /> <br />It is a type of charity to help a worker and to do something for a feeble person. <br /> <br />In another <b>Hadith</b>, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَنْ كَتَمَ عِلْمًا يَعْلَمُهُ أُلْجِمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِلِجَامٍ مِنْ نَار <br /> <br />Whoever kept knowledge to himself will be restrained by a bridle made of fire on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Mujahid and Ata said that; <br /> <br />if asked to do so, &#34;The scribe is required to record.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلْيُمْلِلِ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللّهَ رَبَّهُ <br /> <br />Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, his Lord, <br /> <br />indicates that the debtor should dictate to the scribe what he owes, so let him fear Allah. <br /> <br />وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />And diminish not anything of what he owes, <br /> <br />meaning, not hide any portion of what he owes. <br /> <br />فَإن كَانَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا <br /> <br />But if the debtor is of poor understanding, <br /> <br />and is not allowed to decide on such matters, because he used to waste money, for instance, <br /> <br />أَوْ ضَعِيفًا <br /> <br />Or weak, <br /> <br />such as being too young or insane, <br /> <br />أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ <br /> <br />Or is unable to dictate for himself, <br /> <br />because of a disease, or ignorance about such matters. <br /> <br />فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِالْعَدْلِ <br /> <br />then let his guardian dictate in justice. <br /><b>Witnesses Should Attend the Dictation of Contracts</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاسْتَشْهِدُواْ شَهِيدَيْنِ من رِّجَالِكُمْ <br /> <br />And get two witnesses out of your own men, <br /> <br />requiring witnesses to attend the dictation of contracts to further preserve the contents. <br /> <br />فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَامْرَأَتَانِ <br /> <br />And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, <br /> <br />this requirement is only for contracts that directly or indirectly involve money. Allah requires that two women take the place of one man as witness, because of the woman's shortcomings, as the Prophet described. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded in his <b>Sahih</b> that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />يَا مَعْشَرَ النِّسَاءِ تَصَدَّقْنَ وَأَكْثِرْنَ الاْاسْتِغْفَارَ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُكُنَّ أَكْثَرَ أَهْلِ النَّار <br /> <br />O women! Give away charity and ask for forgiveness, for I saw that you comprise the majority of the people of the Fire. <br /> <br />One eloquent woman said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! Why do we comprise the majority of the people of the Fire?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />تُكْثِرْنَ اللَّعْنَ وَتَكْفُرْنَ الْعَشِيرَ <br /> <br />You curse a lot and you do not appreciate your mate. <br /> <br />وَمَا رَأَيْتُ مِنْ نَاقِصَاتِ عَقْلٍ وَدِينٍ أَغْلَبَ لِذِي لُبَ مِنْكُن <br /> <br />I have never seen those who have shortcoming in mind and religion controlling those who have sound minds, other than you. <br /> <br />She said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! What is this shortcoming in mind and religion?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَمَّا نُقْصَانُ عَقْلِهَا فَشَهَادَةُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ تَعْدِلُ شَهَادَةَ رَجُلٍ فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الْعَقْلِ <br /> <br />As for the shortcoming in her mind, the testimony of two women equals the testimony of one man, and this is the shortcoming in the mind. <br /> <br />وَتَمْكُثُ اللَّيَالِي لَا تُصَلِّي وَتُفْطِرُ فِي رَمَضَانَ فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الدِّين <br /> <br />As for the shortcoming in the religion, woman remains for nights at a time when she does not pray and breaks the fast in Ramadan. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَاء <br /> <br />such as you agree for witnesses, <br /> <br />requires competency in the witnesses. <br /> <br />Further, Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَن تَضِلَّ إْحْدَاهُمَا <br /> <br />so that if one of them errs, <br /> <br />refers to the two women witnesses; whenever one of them forgets a part of the testimony. <br /> <br />فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الاُخْرَى <br /> <br />the other can remind her, <br /> <br />meaning, the other woman's testimony mends the shortcoming of forgetfulness in the first woman. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَاء إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ <br /> <br />And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called, <br /> <br />means, when people are called to be witnesses, they should agree, as Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas stated. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ <br /> <br />Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. <br /> <br />Some say that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> indicates that agreeing to become a witness is <b>Fard Kifayah</b> (required on at least a part of the Muslim <b>Ummah</b>). <br /> <br />However, the majority of the scholars say that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَلَا يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَاء إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ <br /> (And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called), <br /> <br />is referring to testifying to what the witnesses actually witnessed, thus befitting their description of being `witnesses'. <br /> <br />Therefore, when the witness is called to testify to what he witnessed, he is required to give testimony, unless this obligation was already fulfilled, in which case such testimony becomes <b>Fard Kifayah</b>. <br /> <br />Mujahid and Abu Mijlaz said, <br /> <br />&#34;If you are called to be a witness, then you have the choice to agree. If you witnessed and were called to testify, then come forward.&#34; <br /> <br />It was reported that Ibn Abbas and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that; <br /> <br />the obligation includes both cases, agreeing to be a witness and testifying to what one witnessed. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَسْأَمُوْاْ أَن تَكْتُبُوْهُ صَغِيرًا أَو كَبِيرًا إِلَى أَجَلِهِ <br /> <br />You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or large, for its fixed term, <br /> <br />perfects this direction from Allah by commanding that the debt be written, whether the amount is large or small. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br />وَلَا تَسْأَمُوْاْ <br /> (You should not become weary), <br /> <br />meaning, do not be discouraged against writing transactions and their terms, whether the amount involved is large or small. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللّهِ وَأَقْومُ لِلشَّهَادَةِ وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ <br /> <br />that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, <br /> <br />means, writing transactions that will be fulfilled at a later date is more just with Allah meaning better and more convenient in order to preserve the terms of the contract. Therefore, recording such agreements helps the witnesses, when they see their handwriting - or signatures - later on and thus remember what they witnessed, for it is possible that the witnesses might forget what they witnessed. <br /> <br />وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ <br /> (And more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) meaning, <br /> <br />this helps repel any doubt. Since if you need to refer to the contract that you wrote and the doubt will end. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلاَّ تَكْتُبُوهَا <br /> <br />save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. <br /> <br />indicates that if the transaction will be fulfilled immediately, then there is no harm if it is not recorded. <br /> <br />As for requiring witnesses to be present in trading transactions, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَشْهِدُوْاْ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ <br /> <br />But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. <br /> <br />However, this command was abrogated by, <br />فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُوَدِّ الَّذِي اوْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ <br /> (Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully). (2&#59;283) <br /> <br />Or, it could be that having witnesses in such cases is only recommended and not obligatory, as evident from the <b>Hadith</b> that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari narrated which Imam Ahmad collected. <br /> <br />Umarah bin Khuzaymah Al-Ansari said that his uncle, who was among the Prophet's Companions, told him that the Prophet was making a deal for a horse with a Bedouin man. The Prophet asked the Bedouin to follow him so that he could pay him the price of the horse. <br /> <br />The Prophet went ahead of the Bedouin. The Bedouin met several men who tried to buy his horse, not knowing if the Prophet was actually determined to buy it. Some people offered more money for the horse than the Prophet had. <br /> <br />The Bedouin man said to the Prophet, &#34;If you want to buy this horse, then buy it or I will sell it to someone else.&#34; <br /> <br />When he heard the Bedouin man's words, the Prophet stood up and said, &#34;Have I not bought that horse from you?&#34; <br /> <br />The Bedouin said, &#34;By Allah! I have not sold it to you.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, &#34;Rather, I did buy it from you.&#34; <br /> <br />The people gathered around the Prophet and the Bedouin while they were disputing, and the Bedouin said, &#34;Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse.&#34; <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Muslims who came said to the Bedouin, &#34;Woe to you! The Prophet only says the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />When Khuzaymah bin Thabit came and heard the dispute between the Prophet and the Bedouin who was saying, &#34;Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse,&#34; Khuzaymah said, &#34;I bear witness that you sold him the horse.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said to Khuzaymah, &#34;What is the basis of your testimony?&#34; <br /> <br />Khuzaymah said, &#34;That I entrusted you, O Messenger of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, the Messenger made Khuzaymah's testimony equal to the testimony of two men. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا يُضَأرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلَا شَهِيدٌ <br /> <br />Let neither scribe nor witness suffer (or cause) any harm, <br /> <br />also indicates that the scribe and the witness must not cause any harm, such as, when the scribe writes other than what he is being dictated, or the witness testifies to other than what he heard or conceals his testimony. <br /> <br />This is the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَفْعَلُواْ فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ <br /> <br />But if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you, <br /> <br />means, &#34;If you defy what you were commanded and commit what you were prohibited, then it is because of the sin that resides and remains with you; sin that you never release or rid yourselves from.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br /> <br />So have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, <br /> <br />means, fear Him, remember His watch over you, implement His command and avoid what He prohibited. <br /> <br />وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />And Allah teaches you. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />يِـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إَن تَتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا <br /> <br />O you who believe! If you have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, He will grant you <b>Furqan</b> (a criterion to judge between right and wrong). (8&#59;29) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَءَامِنُواْ بِرَسُولِهِ يُوْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُوراً تَمْشُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight). (57&#59;28) <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is the All-Knower of everything. <br /> <br />stating that Allah has perfect knowledge in all matters and in their benefits or repercussions, and nothing escapes His perfect watch, for His knowledge encompasses everything in existence</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 281" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-281/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">282</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>282</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 283" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-283/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=282;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
