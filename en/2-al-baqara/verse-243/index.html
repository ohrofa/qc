(hadhara'l-mawt&#59; an object denoting reason). These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was afflicted with plague. God said to them, `Die!', and they did. Then He gave them life, after eight days or more, as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel (Hizql), and they lived on for a while with the effects of death still upon them, such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the deceased; and this [phenomenon] remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people, such as when He gave life back to those just mentioned, but most people, that is, disbelievers, are not thankful. The purpose of mentioning the story of these people is to encourage believers to fight [in the way of God], which is why the following [statement] is supplemented to it&#59;</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>The Story of the Dead People</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ اللّهُ مُوتُواْ ثُمَّ أَحْيَاهُمْ <br /> <br />Did you (O Muhammad) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death Allah said to them, &#34;Die&#34;. And then He restored them to life. <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim related that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />these people mentioned herein, were the residents of a village called Dawardan. <br /> <br />Ali bin Asim said that; <br /> <br />they were from Dawardan, a village several miles away from Wasit (in Iraq). <br /> <br />In his Tafsir, Waki bin Jarrah said that Ibn Abbas commented, <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ <br /> (Did you (O Muhammad) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death), <br /> <br />that they were four thousand persons who escaped the plague (that broke out in their land). <br /> <br />They said, &#34;We should go to a land that is free of death!&#34; <br /> <br />When they reached a certain area, Allah said to them&#59; <br />مُوتُواْ <br /> (&#34;Die&#34;) and they all died. <br /> <br />Afterwards, one of the Prophets passed by them and supplicated to Allah to resurrect them and Allah brought them back to life. So, Allah stated&#59; <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ <br /> (Did you (O Muhammad) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death). <br /> <br />Furthermore, several scholars among the <b>Salaf</b> said that; <br /> <br />these people were the residents of a city during the time of the Children of Israel. The weather in their land did not suit them and an epidemic broke out. They fled their land fearing death and took refuge in the wilderness. <br /> <br />They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. <br /> <br />They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was Hizqil (Ezekiel), passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. <br /> <br />Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, &#34;O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.&#34; The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, &#34;O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.&#34; That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, &#34;O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.&#34; <br /> <br />They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, &#34;All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago. <br /> <br />We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection. This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ <br /> <br />Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, <br /> <br />meaning, in that He shows them His great signs, sound proofs and clear evidences. <br /> <br />Yet, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but most men thank not. <br /> <br />as they do not thank Allah for what He has given them with in their worldly life and religious affairs. <br /> <br />The story of the dead people (above) also indicates that no caution can ever avert destiny and that there is no refuge from Allah, but to Allah Himself. These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all. <br /> <br />There is an authentic <b>Hadith</b> that Imam Ahmad reported that Abdullah bin Abbas said that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army&#59;Abu Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. <br /> <br />The <b>Hadith</b> then mentioned that Abdur-Rahman bin Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, &#34;I have knowledge regarding this matter. I heard Allah's Messenger say&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا كَانَ بِأَرْضٍ وَأَنْتُمْ بِهَا فَلَ تَخْرُجُوا فِرَارًا مِنْه وإِذَا سَمِعتُمْ به بأَرْضٍ فَل تَقْدمُوا عَلَيْه <br /> <br />If it (the plague) breaks out in a land that you are in, do not leave that land to escape from it. If you hear about it in a land, do not enter it. <br />Umar then thanked Allah and went back. <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also reported in the <b>Sahihayn</b>. <br /><b>Abandoning Jihad does not alter Destiny</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 242" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-242/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">243</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>243</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 244" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-244/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=243;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
