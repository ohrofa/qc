The Companions of the Prophet asked about this matter and Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَاعْتَزِلُواْ النِّسَاء فِي الْمَحِيضِ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىَ يَطْهُرْنَ <br /> (They ask you concerning menstruation. Say&#59;&#34;That is an <b>Adha</b>, therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not in unto them till they are purified). <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />اصْنَعُوا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ النِّكَاح <br /> <br />`Do everything you wish, except having sexual intercourse. <br /> <br />When the Jews were told about the Prophet's statement, they said, &#34;What is the matter with this man He would not hear of any of our practices, but would defy it.&#34; <br /> <br />Then, Usayd bin Hudayr and Abbad bin Bishr came and said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! The Jews said this and that, should we have sex with our women (meaning, during the menstruation period)&#34; <br /> <br />The face of Allah's Messenger changed color, until the Companions thought that he was angry with them. They left. <br /> <br />Soon after, some milk was brought to Allah's Messenger as a gift, and he sent some of it for them to drink. They knew then that Allah's Messenger was not angry with them. <br /> <br />Muslim also reported this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَاعْتَزِلُواْ النِّسَاء فِي الْمَحِيضِ <br />therefore, keep away from women during menses, <br /> <br />meaning, avoid the sexual organ. <br /> <br />The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />اصْنَعُوا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ النِّكَاح <br /> <br />Do anything you wish except having sexual intercourse.) <br /> <br />This is why most of the scholars said that it is allowed to fondle the wife, except for having sexual intercourse (when she is having her menses). <br /> <br />Abu Dawud reported that Ikrimah related to one of the Prophet's wives that she said that; <br /> <br />whenever the Prophet wanted to fondle (one of his wives) during her menses, he would cover her sexual organ with something. <br /> <br />Abu Jafar bin Jarir related that; <br /> <br />Masruq went to Aishah and greeted her, and Aishah greeted him in return. Masruq said, &#34;I wish to ask you about a matter, but I am shy.&#34; <br /> <br />She replied, &#34;I am your mother and you are my son.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;What can the man enjoy of his wife when she is having her menses?&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;Everything except her sexual organ.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ikrimah. <br /> <br />One is Allowed to Sleep next to his Wife and to Eat with Her (when she is having her menses) <br /> <br />Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger used to ask me to wash his hair while I was having the menses. He would lay on my lap and read the Qur'an while I was having the period.&#34; <br /> <br />It is also reported in the <b>Sahih</b> that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;While having the menses, I used to eat from a piece of meat and give it to the Prophet who would eat from the same place I ate from. I used to have sips of a drink and would then give the cup to the Prophet who would place his mouth where I placed my mouth.&#34; <br /> <br />It is also reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whenever the Prophet wanted to fondle any of his wives during the periods (menses), he used to ask her to wear an <b>Izar</b> (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).&#34; <br /> <br />These are the wordings collected by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Aishah. <br /> <br />In addition, Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported that; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Sa`d Al-Ansari asked Allah's Messenger, &#34;What am I allowed of my wife while she is having her menses?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;What is above the <b>Izar</b> (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).&#34; <br /> <br />Hence, Allah's statement&#59; <br />وَلَا تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىَ يَطْهُرْنَ <br /> (...and go not in unto them till they are purified) explains His statement&#59; <br />فَاعْتَزِلُواْ النِّسَاء فِي الْمَحِيضِ <br /> (...therefore, keep away from women during menses). <br /> <br />Allah prohibited having sexual intercourse with the wife during menstruation, indicating that sexual intercourse is allowed otherwise. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you. <br /> <br />indicates that men should have sexual intercourse with their wives after they take a bath. <br /> <br />The scholars agree that the woman is obliged to take a bath, or to perform <b>Tayammum</b> with sand, if she is unable to use water, before she is allowed to have sexual intercourse with her husband, after the monthly period ends. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />حَتَّىَ يَطْهُرْنَ <br /> &#34;(till they are purified) means from blood, and, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ <br /> (And when they have purified themselves) means with water.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the Tafsir of Mujahid, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Al-Layth bin Sa`d and others. <br /><b>Anal Sex is prohibited</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللّهُ <br />as Allah has ordained for you. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and other scholars have stated that; <br /> <br />this refers to <b>Al-Farj</b> (the vagina) <br /> <br />Therefore, anal sex is prohibited, as we will further emphasize afterwards, Allah willing. <br /> <br />Abu Razin, Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak and others said that&#59; <br />فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللّهُ <br /> (...then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you) means, <br /> <br />when they are pure, and not during the menses. <br /> <br />Allah said afterwards&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ التَّوَّابِينَ <br /> <br />Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance, <br /> <br />from the sin even if it was repeated. <br /> <br />وَيُحِبُّ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and loves those who purify themselves. <br /> <br />meaning, those who purify themselves from the impurity and the filth that include having sexual intercourse with the wife during the menses and anal sex. <br /><b>The Reason behind revealing Allah's Statement&#59;&#34;Your Wives are a Tilth for You.</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 221" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-221/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">222</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>222</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 223" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-223/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=222;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
