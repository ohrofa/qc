In one hadth, the Prophet (s) stood there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly, according to Muslim; and remember Him as He has guided you, to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrimage (the kf of ka-m, `as', is the particle denoting the reason), though previously, before His guidance, you were astray.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Commercial Transactions during Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Ukaz</b>, <b>Mijannah</b> and <b>Dhul-Majaz</b> were trading posts during the time of Jahiliyyah. During that era, they did not like the idea of conducting business transactions during the <b>Hajj</b> season. Later, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord), during the <b>Hajj</b> season.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and others recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;They used to avoid conducting business transactions during the <b>Hajj</b> season, saying that these are the days of <b>Dhikr</b>. Allah revealed&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading)).&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the explanation of Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Mansur bin Al-Mutamir, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and others. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Umaymah said that; <br /> <br />when Ibn Umar was asked about conducting trade during the <b>Hajj</b>, he recited the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading)). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is related to Ibn Umar with a strong chain of narrators. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also related to the Prophet, as Ahmad reported that Abu Umamah At-Taymi said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked Ibn Umar, `We buy (and sell during the <b>Hajj</b>), so do we still have a valid <b>Hajj</b>?' <br /> <br />He said, `Do you not perform <b>Tawaf</b> around the House, stand at <b>Arafat</b>, throw the pebbles and shave your heads?' <br /> <br />I said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />Ibn Umar said, `A man came to the Prophet and asked him about what you asked me, and the Prophet did not answer him until Jibril came down with this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading)). <br /> <br />The Prophet summoned the man and said&#59;You are pilgrims.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir narrated that Abu Salih said to Umar, <br /> <br />&#34;`O Leader of the faithful! Did you conduct trade transactions during the <b>Hajj</b>?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Was their livelihood except during <b>Hajj</b>!&#34; <br /><b>Standing at Arafat</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> <br />Then when you leave <b>Arafat</b>, remember Allah (by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations) at the <b>Mash`ar-il-Haram</b>. <br /><b>Arafat</b> is the place where one stands during the <b>Hajj</b> and it is a pillar of the rituals of <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and the <b>Sunan</b> compilers recorded that Abdur-Rahman bin Yamar Ad-Diyli said that he heard Allah's Messenger saying&#59; <br /> <br />الْحَجُّ عَرَفَاتٌ ثَلَثًا فَمَنْ أَدْرَكَ عَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْرُ فَقَدْ أَدْرَكَ وَأَيَّامُ مِنًى ثَلَثَــةٌ فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّر فَلَ إِثْمَ عَلَيه <br /><b>Hajj</b> is <b>Arafat</b>, (thrice). Hence, those who have stood at <b>Arafat</b> before dawn will have performed (the rituals of the <b>Hajj</b>). The days of <b>Mina</b> are three, and there is no sin for those who move on after two days, or for those who stay. <br /> <br />The time to stand on <b>Arafat</b> starts from noon on the day of <b>Arafah</b> until dawn the next day, which is the day of the Sacrifice (the tenth day of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>). <br /> <br />The Prophet stood at <b>Arafat</b> during the Farewell <b>Hajj</b>, after he had offered the <b>Zuhr</b> (noon) prayer, until sunset. He said, &#34;Learn your rituals from me.&#34; <br /> <br />In this <b>Hadith</b> (i.e., in the previous paragraph) he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever stood at <b>Arafat</b> before dawn, will have performed (the rituals of <b>Hajj</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />Urwah bin Mudarris bin Harithah bin Lam At-Ta'i said, <br /> <br />&#34;I came to Allah's Messenger at <b>Al-Muzdalifah</b> when it was time to pray. I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I came from the two mountains of Tayy', and my animal became tired and I became tired. I have not left any mountain, but stood on it. Do I have a valid <b>Hajj</b>?' <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ شَهِدَ صَلَتَنَا هذِهِ فَوَقَفَ مَعَنَا حَتَّى نَدْفَعَ وَقَدْ وَقَفَ بِعَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ ذلِكَ لَيْلً أَوْ نَهارًا فَقَدْ تَمَّ حَجُّهُ وَقَضَى تَفَثَه <br /> <br />Whoever performed this prayer with us, stood with us until we moved forth, and had stood at <b>Arafat</b> before that, day or night, will have performed the <b>Hajj</b> and completed its rituals.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected by Imam Ahmad and the compilers of the <b>Sunan</b>, and At-Tirmidhi graded it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />It was reported that the mount was called <b>Arafat</b> because, as Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ali bin Abu Talib said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah sent Jibril to Prophet Ibrahim and he performed <b>Hajj</b> for him (to teach him its rituals). <br /> <br />When Ibrahim reached <b>Arafat</b> he said, `I have <b>Araftu</b> (I know this place).' <br /> <br />He had come to that area before. Thereafter, it was called <b>Arafat</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Al-Mubarak said that Ata said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was called <b>Arafat</b> because Jibril used to teach Ibrahim the rituals of <b>Hajj</b>. Ibrahim would say, `I have <b>Araftu</b>, I have <b>Araftu</b>.' It was thereafter called <b>Arafat</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar statements were attributed to Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar and Abu Mijlaz. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /><b>Arafat</b> is also called <b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</b>, <b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Aqsa</b> and <b>Ilal</b>, while the mount that is in the middle of <b>Arafat</b> is called <b>Jabal Ar-Rahmah</b> (Mount of Mercy). <br /><b>The Time to leave Arafat and Al-Muzdalifah</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, the people used to stand at Arafat. When the sun would be on top of the mountains, just as the turban is on top of a man's head, they would move on. Allah's Messenger delayed moving from Arafat until sunset.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Marduwyah related this <b>Hadith</b> and added, <br /> <br />&#34;He then stood at <b>Al-Muzdalifah</b> and offered the <b>Fajr</b> (Dawn) prayer at an early time. When the light of dawn broke, he moved on.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has a <b>Hasan</b> chain of narrators. <br /> <br />The long <b>Hadith</b> that Jabir bin Abdullah narrated, which Muslim collected, stated, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet kept standing there (meaning at <b>Arafat</b>) until sunset, when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. Then, the Prophet made Usamah sit behind him, and in order to keep her under control, pulled the nose string of Al-Qaswa' so hard, that its head touched the saddle. He gestured with his right hand and said, &#34;Proceed calmly people, calmly!&#34; <br /> <br />Whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he lightly loosened the nose string of his camel till she climbed up and this is how they reached <b>Al-Muzdalifah</b>. <br /> <br />There, he led the <b>Maghrib</b> (Evening) and <b>Isha</b> (Night) prayers with one <b>Adhan</b> and two <b>Iqamah</b> (which announces the imminent start of the acts of the prayer) and did not glorify Allah in between them (i.e., he did not perform voluntary <b>Rak`ah</b>). <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger then laid down till dawn and offered the <b>Fajr</b> (Dawn) prayer with <b>Adhan</b> and <b>Iqamah</b>, when the morning light was clear. <br /> <br />He again mounted Al-Qaswa', and when he came to <b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</b>, he faced towards <b>Qiblah</b>, supplicated to Allah, glorifying Him and saying, <b>La ilaha illallah</b>, and he continued standing until the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose.&#34; <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Usamah bin Zayd was asked, &#34;How was the Prophet's pace when he moved?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Slow, unless he found space, then he would go a little faster.&#34; <br /><b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</b> <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn Umar said that all of <b>Al-Muzdalifah</b> is <b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</b>. <br /> <br />It was reported that Ibn Umar was asked about Allah's statement&#59; <br />فَاذْكُرُواْ اللّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> (...remember Allah (by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations) at the <b>Mash`ar-il-Haram</b>), he said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is the Mount and the surrounding area.&#34; <br /> <br />It was reported that; <br /><b>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</b> is what is between the two Mounts (refer to the following <b>Hadith</b>), as Ibn Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Al-Hasan and Qatadah have stated. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />كُلُّ عَرَفَاتٍ مَوْقِفٌ وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ عُرَنَةَ <br /> <br />وَكُلُّ مُزْدَلِفَةَ مَوْقِفٌ وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ مُحَسِّرٍ <br /> <br />وَكُلُّ فِجَاجِ مَكَّةَ مَنْحَرٌ وَكُلُّ أَيَّامِ التَّشْرِيقِ ذَبْح <br /> <br />All of <b>Arafat</b> is a place of standing, and keep away from <b>Uranah</b>. <br /> <br />All of <b>Al-Muzdalifah</b> is a place for standing, and keep away from the bottom of <b>Muhassir</b>. <br /> <br />All of the areas of Makkah are a place for sacrifice, and all of the days of <b>Tashriq</b> are days of sacrifice. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَاكُمْ <br /> <br />And remember Him (by invoking Allah for all good) as He has guided you. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> reminds Muslims of Allah's bounty on them that He has directed and taught them the rituals of <b>Hajj</b> according to the guidance of Prophet Ibrahim <b>Al-Khalil</b>. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الضَّألِّينَ <br /> <br /> <br />and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray. <br /> <br />It was said that this <b>Ayah</b> refers to the condition before the guidance or the Qur'an or the Messenger, all of which are correct meanings</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 197" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-197/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">198</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>198</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 199" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-199/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=198;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
