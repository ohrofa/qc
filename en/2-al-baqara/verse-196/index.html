And remain conscious of God, and know that God is stern in retribution.</p></div></div></article><article id="jalalayn" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#jalalayn"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>26</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation to God, by completing them according to their due; but if you are prevented, from fulfilling them by an enemy, then [give] such offering as may be feasible, for you -- a sheep -- and do not shave your heads, that is, do not release yourselves from the state of pilgrimage inviolability, until the offering, mentioned, reaches its place, its place of sacrifice, that is, within the enclosure, according to al-Shfi`; the sacrifice is then made with the intention of releasing oneself from the state of pilgrimage inviolability, and is divided among the needy, after which the head is shaved and the release is effected. If any of you is sick, or has an ailment of the head, such as lice or severe pains, and has thus shaved his head while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, then, incumbent upon him is, a redemption by fast, for three days, or a voluntary almsgiving, consisting of three cubic measures of the principal food of the town for six needy persons, or a ritual sacrifice, that is, the slaughter of a sheep (aw, `or', denotes freedom of choice). To this [last] has been added the [case of the] one who shaves his head without excuse because the requirement of redemption is most obvious in his case; but also [it is required in the case of] one that enjoys, without shaving, such things as scents, attire, or oils, be it with an excuse or without. When you are secure, knowing that the enemy has gone or is not present, then whoever enjoys the Visitation, having completed it and observed its ritual prohibitions, until the Pilgrimage, until he enters its ritual inviolability in the relevant months; let his offering be such as is feasible, for him, such as a sheep that he sacrifices after entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability, ideally, on the Day of Sacrifice; or if he finds none, because there are none available, or because he does not have sufficient funds, then, incumbent upon him is, a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage, that is to say, in a state of pilgrimage inviolability. In such a case, he should enter into the state of pilgrimage inviolability before the seventh of Dh'l-Hijja, but ideally before the sixth, because one is discouraged from fasting on the Day of `Arafa. Moreover, he should not fast during these the days of tashrq, according to the sounder of two opinions attributed to al-Shfi`. And of seven when you return, to your domicile, [be it] Mecca or any other; or when you have completed the rites of the Pilgrimage' (there is a shift from the third [to the second] person); that is a full ten (this sentence reaffirms what has just been said); that, mentioned stipulation regarding the incumbency of the offering or the fast upon the person that has enjoyed [the Visitation], is for him whose family are not present at the Sacred Mosque, so that they are not within 50 miles of the Sacred Enclosure, according to al-Shfi`. If they are [present however], then no blood [sacrifice] or fast is obligatory in his case, even if he has enjoyed [the Visitation]. The mention of `family' is intended as a notification of the proviso in the case of being `domiciled' [in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque]. If one were to take up [temporary] residence, but not be domiciled, before the months of the Pilgrimage and enjoy the Visitation, then that [fast or sacrifice] will be incumbent upon him; this is one of two opinions of al-Shfi`, the other being that it is not [incumbent]. The term ahl, `family', is said to denote `oneself'. In the Sunna, in addition to the one that enjoys the Visitation, as mentioned, there is also the one that enters into the state of pilgrimage inviolability for both the Visitation and the Pilgrimage together [sc. qrin, `one who combines'] or in the case where the Pilgrimage encroaches upon [a Visitation], but before circumambulation [has been performed]. And fear God, in what He commands you and prohibits you; and know that God is severe in retribution, against whoever opposes Him.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>The Command to complete Hajj and Umrah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلّهِ <br /> <br />And complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> for Allah. <br /> <br />After Allah mentioned the rulings for fasting and <b>Jihad</b>, he explained the rituals by commanding the Muslims to complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, to finish the rituals of <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> after one starts them. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said afterwards&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ <br /> <br />But if you are prevented, <br /> <br />meaning, if your way to the House is obstructed, and you are prevented from finishing it. <br /> <br />This is why the scholars agree that starting the acts of <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> requires one to finish them. <br /> <br />As for Makhul, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Complete, means to start them from the <b>Miqat</b> (areas the Prophet designated to assume <b>Ihram</b> from).&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Az-Zuhri said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;We were told that Umar commented on&#59; <br />وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلّهِ <br /> (And complete <b>Hajj</b> and Umrah for Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;Complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> means performing each of them separately, and to perform <b>Umrah</b> outside of the months of <b>Hajj</b>, for Allah the Exalted says&#59; <br />الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ <br /> (The <b>Hajj</b> (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months),&#34; (2&#59;197). <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br />وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلّهِ <br /> (And complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> for Allah) means, <br /> <br />&#34;Maintain the performance of <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas was reported to have said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Hajj</b> is <b>Arafat</b>, while <b>Umrah</b> is <b>Tawaf</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Amash related that Ibrahim said that Alqamah commented on Allah's statement&#59; <br />وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلّهِ <br /> (And complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> for Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) recited it this way&#59; <br /> <br />`Complete <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> to the House, so that one does not exceed the area of the House during the <b>Umrah</b>'.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibrahim then said, &#34;I mentioned this statement to Sa`id bin Jubayr and he said; <br /> <br />`Ibn Abbas also said that.&#34;' <br /> <br />Sufyan reported that Ibrahim said that Alqamah said regarding the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Perform the <b>Hajj</b> and Umrah to the House.&#34; <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri reported that Ibrahim read (the <b>Ayah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;Perform the <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> to the House.&#34; <br /><b>If One is prevented while in Route, He slaughters the Sacrifice, shaves his Head and ends Ihram</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> <br /> <br />But if you are prevented, sacrifice a <b>Hady</b> (animals for sacrifice) such as you can afford, <br /> <br />was revealed in the sixth year of <b>Hijrah</b>, the year of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the polytheists prevented Allah's Messenger from reaching the House. <br /> <br />Allah revealed Surah <b>Al-Fath</b> then, and allowed the Muslims to slaughter any <b>Hady</b> (animals for sacrifice) they had. They had seventy camels with them for that purpose. <br /> <br />They were also permitted to shave their heads and end their <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />When the Prophet commanded them to shave their heads and end the state of <b>Ihram</b>, they did not obey him, as they were awaiting that order to be abrogated. When they saw that the Prophet went out after shaving his head, they imitated him. Some of them did not shave, but only shortened their hair. This is why the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />رَحِمَ اللهُ الْمُحَلِّقِين <br /> <br />May Allah award His mercy to those who shaved. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;What about those who shortened the hair?&#34; <br /> <br />He said in the third time, &#34;And to those who shortened.&#34; <br /> <br />Every seven among them shared one camel for their sacrifice. They were one thousand and four hundred Companions and were camping in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah, outside the Sacred Area. It was also reported that they were within the boundaries of the Sacred Area. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Being prevented from the House (<b>Hasr</b>) includes more than just being sick, fearing an enemy or getting lost on the way to Makkah. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Al-Hajjaj bin Amr Al-Ansari said that he heard Allah's Messenger saying&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ كُسِرَ أَوْ عَرِجَ فَقَدْ حَلَّ وَعَلَيْهِ حَجَّةٌ أُخْرَى <br /> <br />Whoever suffered a broken bone or a limb, will have ended his <b>Ihram</b> and has to perform <b>Hajj</b> again. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I mentioned that to Ibn Abbas and Abu Hurayrah and they both said, `He (<b>Al-Hajjaj</b>) has said the truth'.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also reported in the Four Collections. <br /> <br />In the version of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever limped, had a broken bone or became ill...&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim also recorded it and said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Alqamah, Sa`id bin Musayyib, Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Mujahid, An-Nakhai, Ata and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br /> <br />being prevented (<b>Hasr</b>) entails an enemy, an illness or a fracture.&#34; <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri also said, <br /> <br />&#34;Being prevented entails everything that harms the person.&#34; <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Aishah said that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger went to Dubaah bint Az-Zubayr bin Abdul-Muttalib who said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! I intend to perform <b>Hajj</b> but I am ill.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Perform <b>Hajj</b> and make the condition&#59;`My place is where You prevent (or halt) me.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim recorded similarly from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />So saying such a condition for <b>Hajj</b> is allowed is based on this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br />فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (...sacrifice a <b>Hady</b> such as you can afford), <br /> <br />includes a sheep also, as Imam Malik reported that Ali bin Abu Talib used to say. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Hady</b> includes eight types of animals&#59; <br /> <br />camels, <br /> <br />cows, <br /> <br />goats and <br /> <br />sheep.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn Abbas said about what Allah said&#59; <br />فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (...sacrifice a <b>Hady</b> such as you can afford), <br /> <br />&#34;As much as one could afford.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;If one can afford it, then camels, otherwise cows, or sheep.&#34; <br /> <br />Hisham bin Urwah quoted his father&#59; <br />فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (...sacrifice a <b>Hady</b> (animal, i.e., a sheep, a cow, or a camel), <br /> <br />such as you can afford, `Depending on the price.' <br /> <br />The proof that sacrificing only a sheep is allowed in the case of being prevented from continuing the rites, is that Allah has required sacrificing whatever is available as a <b>Hady</b>, and the <b>Hady</b> is any type of cattle; be it camels, cows or sheep. This is the opinion of Ibn Abbas the cousin of Allah's Messenger and the scholar of <b>Tafsir</b>. <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Aishah, the Mother of the believers, said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet once offered some sheep as <b>Hady</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَحْلِقُواْ رُوُوسَكُمْ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ <br />and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice, <br /> <br />is a continuation of His statement&#59; <br />وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلّهِ <br /> (And complete, the <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> for Allah.) and is not dependent upon&#59; <br />فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (But if you are prevented, then sacrifice a <b>Hady</b>) as Ibn Jarir has erroneously claimed. <br /> <br />When the Prophet and his Companions were prevented from entering the Sacred House during the Al-Hudaybiyyah year by the polytheists from Quraysh, they shaved their heads and sacrificed their <b>Hady</b> outside the <b>Haram</b> (Sacred) area. <br /> <br />In normal circumstances, and when one can safely reach the House, he is not allowed to shave his head until&#59; <br />حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ <br /> (.. .and do not shave your heads until the <b>Hady</b> reaches the place of sacrifice), and then he ends the rituals of <b>Hajj</b> or <b>Umrah</b>, or both if he had assumed <b>Ihram</b> for both. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Hafsah said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! What is wrong with the people, they have finished their <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Umrah</b> but you have not?&#34; The Prophet said, <br /> <br />إنِّي لَبَّدْتُ رَأْسِي وَقَلَّدْتُ هَدْيِي فَلَ أَحِلُّ حَتَّى أَنْحَر <br /> <br />I matted my hair and I have garlanded my <b>Hady</b> (animals for sacrifice), so I will not finish my <b>Ihram</b> till I offer the sacrifice. <br /><b>Whoever shaved his Head during Ihram, will have to pay the Fidyah</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ <br /> <br /> <br />And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment on his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a <b>Fidyah</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that Abdur-Rahman bin Asbahani said that he heard Abdullah bin Ma`qil saying that; <br /> <br />he sat with Ka`b bin Ujrah in the mosque of Kufah (in Iraq). He then asked him about the <b>Fidyah</b> of the fasting. <br /> <br />Ka`b said, &#34;This was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. <br /> <br />I was carried to Allah's Messenger and the lice were falling in great numbers on my face. The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا كُنْتُ أُرَى أَنَّ الْجَهْدَ بلَغَ بكَ هذَا أمَا تَجِدُ شَاة <br /> <br />I never thought that your ailment (or struggle) had reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep (for sacrifice)?' <br /> <br />I replied in the negative. <br /> <br />He then said&#59; <br /> <br />صُمْ ثَلَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ أَوْ أَطْعِمْ سِتَّةَ مَسَاكِينَ لِكُلِّ مِسْكِينٍ نِصْفُ صَاعٍ مِنْ طَعَامٍ وَاحْلِقْ رَأْسَك <br /> <br />Fast for three days or feed six poor persons, each with half a <b>Sa`</b> of food (1 <b>Sa`</b> = 3 kilograms approx) and shave your head. <br /> <br />So this is a general judgment derived from a specific case. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Ujrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger came by while I was igniting the fire under a pot and while the lice were falling down my head or my eyelids. He said&#59; <br /> <br />يُوْذِيكَ هَوَامُّ رَأْسِك <br /> <br />Do these lice in your head bother you? <br /> <br />I said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />فَاحْلِقْهُ وَصُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ أَوْ أَطْعِمْ سِتَّةَ مَسَاكِينَ أَوِ انْسُكْ نَسِيكَة <br /> <br />Shave it, then fast three days, or feed six poor people, or sacrifice an animal. <br /> <br />Ayub (one of the narrators of the <b>Hadith</b>) commented, <br /> <br />&#34;I do not know which alternative was stated first.&#34; <br /> <br />The wording of the Qur'an begins with the easiest then the more difficult options&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Pay a <b>Fidyah</b> of fasting (three days), feeding (six poor persons) or sacrificing (an animal).&#34; <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Prophet advised Ka`b with the more rewarding option first, that is, sacrificing a sheep, then feeding six poor persons, then fasting three days. <br /> <br />Each Text is suitable in its place and context, all the thanks and praises are due to Allah. <br /><b>Tamattu During Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> <br />Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the Umrah (in the months of <b>Hajj</b>), before (performing) the <b>Hajj</b>, he must slaughter a <b>Hady</b> such as he can afford, <br /> <br />That is, when you are able to complete the rites, so whoever among you connects his <b>Umrah</b> with <b>Hajj</b> having the same <b>Ihram</b> for both, or, <br /> <br />first assuming <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Umrah</b>, and then assuming <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> when finished the <b>Umrah</b>, this is the more specific type of <b>Tamattu</b> which is well-known among the discussion of the scholars whereas in general there are two types of <b>Tamattu</b>, as the authentic <b>Hadiths</b> prove, since among the narrators are those who said, &#34;Allah's Messenger performed <b>Tamattu</b>, and others who said, &#34;<b>Qarin</b>&#34; but there is no difference between them over the <b>Hady</b>. <br /> <br />So Allah said, <br />فَإِذَا أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the <b>Umrah</b> (in the months of <b>Hajj</b>), before (performing) the <b>Hajj</b> (i.e., <b>Hajj</b> <b>At-Tamattu</b> and <b>Al-Qiran</b>, he must slaughter a <b>Hady</b> such as he can afford), <br /> <br />means let him sacrifice whatever <b>Hady</b> is available to him, the least of which is a sheep. One is also allowed to sacrifice a cow because the Prophet slaughtered cows on behalf of his wives. <br /> <br />Al-Awzai reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger slaughtered cows on behalf of his wives when they were performing <b>Tamattu</b>. <br /> <br />This was reported by Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah. <br /> <br />This last <b>Hadith</b> proves that <b>Tamattu</b> is legislated. <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Imran bin Husayn said, <br /> <br />&#34;We performed <b>Hajj At-Tamattu</b> in the lifetime of Allah's Messenger and then the Qur'an was revealed (regarding <b>Hajj At-Tamattu</b>). Nothing was revealed to forbid it, nor did he (the Prophet) forbid it until he died. And somebody said what he wished (regarding <b>Hajj At-Tamattu</b>) according to his own opinion.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said that Imran was talking about Umar. <br /> <br />It is reported in an authentic narration that; <br /> <br />Umar used to discourage the people from performing <b>Tamattu</b>. <br /> <br />He used to say, &#34;If we refer to Allah's Book, we should complete it,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning&#59; <br />فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ <br /> (...whosoever performs the <b>Umrah</b> (in the months of <b>Hajj</b>), before (performing) the <b>Hajj</b>, he must slaughter a <b>Hady</b> such as he can afford. <br /> <br />However Umar did not say that <b>Tamattu</b> is unlawful. He only prevented them so that the people would increase their trips to the House for <b>Hajj</b> (during the months of <b>Hajj</b>) and <b>Umrah</b> (throughout the year), as he himself has stated. <br /><b>Whoever performs Tamattu` should fast Ten Days if He does not have a Hady</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ <br />but if he cannot (afford it), he should fast three days during the <b>Hajj</b> and seven days after his return (to his home), making ten days in all. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Those who do not find a <b>Hady</b>, let them fast three days during the <b>Hajj</b> season.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;If one does not have a <b>Hady</b>, he should fast three days during <b>Hajj</b>, before <b>Arafah</b> day. If the day of <b>Arafah</b> was the third day, then his fast is complete. He should also fast seven days when he gets back home.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Ishaq reported from Wabarah from Ibn Umar who said, <br /> <br />&#34;One fasts one day before the day of <b>Tarwiyah</b>, the day of <b>Tarwiyah</b> (eighth day of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>) and then <b>Arafah</b> day (the ninth day of the month of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />The same statement was reported by Jafar bin Muhammad from his father from Ali. <br /> <br />If one did not fast these three days or at least some of them before <b>`Id</b> day (the tenth day of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>), he is allowed to fast during the <b>Tashriq</b> days (11-12-13th day of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>). ` <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari has reported that Aishah and Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;Fasting the days of <b>Tashriq</b> was only allowed for those who did not find the <b>Hady</b>,&#34; <br /> <br />Sufyan related that Jafar bin Muhammad narrated that his father said that Ali said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever did not fast the three days during the <b>Hajj</b>, should fast them during the days of <b>Tashriq</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the position taken by Ubayd bin Umayr Al-Laythi, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, referring to the general meaning of Allah's statement&#59; <br />فَصِيَامُ ثَلثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ <br /> (...fast three days during the <b>Hajj</b>...). <br /> <br />As for what Muslim reported that Qutaybah Al-Hudhali said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وَشُرْبٍ وَذِكْرِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />The days of <b>Tashriq</b> are days of eating and drinking and remembering Allah the Exalted. <br /> <br />This narration is general in meaning while what Aishah and Ibn Umar narrated is specific. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ <br />and seven days after his return. <br /> <br />There are two opinions regarding the meaning of this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />First, it means `when you return to the camping areas'. <br /> <br />The second, upon going back home. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Salim narrated that he heard Ibn Umar saying&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ <br /> &#34;(...but if he cannot (afford it), he should fast three days during the <b>Hajj</b> and seven days after his return), means when he goes back to his family.&#34; <br /> <br />The same opinion was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Aliyah, Mujahid, Ata, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Imam Az-Zuhri and Ar-Rabi bin Anas. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that Salim bin Abdullah narrated that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the Farewell <b>Hajj</b> of Allah's Messenger, he performed <b>Tamattu</b> with <b>Umrah</b> and <b>Hajj</b>. He drove a <b>Hady</b> along with him from Dhul-Hulayfah. Allah's Messenger started by assuming <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Umrah</b>, and then for <b>Hajj</b>. And the people, too, performed the <b>Umrah</b> and <b>Hajj</b> along with the Prophet. <br /> <br />Some of them brought the <b>Hady</b> and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Makkah, he said to the people&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُم أَهْدَى فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَحِلُّ مِنْ شَيْءٍ حَرُمَ مِنْهُ حَتَّى يَقْضِيَ حَجَّهُ <br /> <br />Whoever among you has driven the <b>Hady</b>, should not finish his <b>Ihram</b> till he completes his <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />وَمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أَهْدَى فَلْيَطُفْ بالْبَيْتِ وبالصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةِ وَلْيُقَصِّرْ وَلْيَحْلِلْ ثُمَّ لْيُهِلَّ بِالْحَجِّ <br /> <br />And whoever among you has not (driven) the <b>Hady</b> with him, he should perform <b>Tawaf</b> of the <b>Ka`bah</b> and between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>. Then, he should shave or cut his hair short and finish his <b>Ihram</b>, and should later assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b>; (but he must offer a Hady (sacrifice)). <br /> <br />فَمَنْ لَمْ يجَدْ هَدْيًا فَلْيَصُمْ ثَلَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعةً إِذَا رَجَعَ إِلى أَهْلِه <br /> <br />And if anyone cannot afford a <b>Hady</b>, he should fast for three days during the <b>Hajj</b> and seven days when he returns home. <br /> <br />He then mentioned the rest of the <b>Hadith</b>, which is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ <br />making ten days in all. <br /> <br />to emphasize the ruling we mentioned above. <br /> <br />This method is common in the Arabic language, for they would say, `I have seen with my eyes, heard with my ears and written with my hand,' to emphasize such facts. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا طَايِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ <br />nor a bird that flies with its two wings. (6&#59;38) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَخُطُّهُ بِيَمِينِكَ <br />nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand. (29&#59;48) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَوَعَدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلَـثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَـتُ رَبِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً <br /> <br />And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added (to the period) ten (more), and he completed the term, appointed by his Lord, of forty nights. (7&#59;142) <br /> <br />It was also said that; <br /> <br />the meaning of &#34;ten days in all&#34; emphasizes the order to fast for ten days, not less than that. <br /><b>The Residents of Makkah do not perform Tamattu&#34;</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> <br />This is for him whose family is not present at <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> (i.e., non-resident of Makkah). <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> concerns the residents of the area of the <b>Haram</b>, for they do not perform <b>Tamattu</b>. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Tawus said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Tamattu</b> is for the people, those whose families are not residing in the <b>Haram</b> area (Makkah), not for the residents of Makkah. Hence Allah's Statement&#59;<b> <br />ذَلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br /></b> (This is for him whose family is not present at <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> (i.e., non-resident of Makkah). <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq then said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was also told that Ibn Abbas said similar to Tawus.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br />and fear Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, in what He has commanded you and what He prohibited for you. <br /> <br />He then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ <br /> <br /> <br />and know that Allah is severe in punishment. <br /> <br />for those who defy His command and commit what He has prohibited</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 195" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-195/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">196</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>196</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 197" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-197/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=196;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
