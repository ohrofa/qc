His likeness is that of a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bare—they gain nothing from their efforts. God does not guide the disbelieving people.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>O you who believe, annul not, the rewards of, your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury, as, in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of, one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day&#59; this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil, and a torrent, of intense rain, smites it, and leaves it barren, and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power (l yaqdirna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the [potential plural] implication of alladh, `the one who') over anything that they have earned, that they did, in other words, they find no reward for it in the Hereafter, just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock, after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَاتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاذَى <br /> <br />O you who believe! Do not render in vain your <b>Sadaqah</b> (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, <br /> <br />stating that the charity will be rendered in vain if it is followed by harm or reminders. In this case, the reward of giving away charity is not sufficient enough to nullify the harm and reminders. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />كَالَّذِي يُنفِقُ مَالَهُ رِيَاء النَّاسِ <br /> <br />like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;Do not nullify your acts of charity by following them with reminders and harm, just like the charity of those who give it to show off to people.&#34; <br /> <br />The boasting person pretends to give away charity for Allah's sake, but in reality seeks to gain people's praise and the reputation of being kind or generous, or other material gains of this life. All the while, he does not think about Allah or gaining His pleasure and generous rewards, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا يُوْمِنُ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ <br /> <br />and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. <br /> <br />Allah next set the example of whoever gives charity to show off. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak commented that the example fits one who follows his acts of charity with reminders or harm. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فََََمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ <br /> <br />His likeness is the likeness of <b>Safwan</b>, <br /> <br />where <b>Safwan</b>, from is <b>Safwanah</b>, meaning `the smooth rocks,' <br /> <br />عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ <br /> <br />on which is little dust; on it falls a <b>Wabil</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, heavy rain. <br /> <br />فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا <br /> <br />which leaves it bare. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means that heavy rain left the <b>Safwan</b> completely barren of dust. Such is the case with Allah's action regarding the work of those who show off, as their deeds are bound to vanish and disappear, even though people think that these deeds are as plentiful as specks of dust. <br /> <br />So Allah said, <br /> <br />لااَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَيْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 263" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-263/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">264</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>264</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 265" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-265/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=264;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
