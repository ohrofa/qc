And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. <br /> <br />The majority of the scholars said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) was abrogated by the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;234), what Allah said&#59; <br />يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا <br /> (...they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days), (2&#59;234). <br /> <br />For instance, Al-Bukhari reported that; <br /> <br />Ibn Az-Zubayr said&#59;I said to Uthman bin Affan&#59; <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا <br /> (And those of you who die and leave wives behind them) was abrogated by the other <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;234). Therefore, why did you collect it (meaning, in the Qur'an)?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;O my nephew! I shall not change any part of the Qur'an from its place.&#34; <br /> <br />The question that Ibn Az-Zubayr asked Uthman means&#59; <br /> <br />`If the ruling of the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) was abrogated to four months (the <b>Iddah</b> of the widow, and refer to 2&#59;234), then what is the wisdom behind including it in the Qur'an, although its ruling has been abrogated? <br /> <br />If the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) remains (in the Qur'an) after the <b>Ayah</b> that abrogated it (2&#59;234), this might imply that its ruling is still valid.' <br /> <br />Uthman, the Leader of the faithful, answered him by stating that this is a matter of the revelation, which mentioned these <b>Ayat</b> in this order. `Therefore, I shall leave the <b>Ayah</b> where I found it in the Qur'an.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said about what Allah said&#59; <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لاَِّزْوَاجِهِم مَّتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ <br /> (And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance (and residence) without turning them out), <br /> <br />&#34;The widow used to reside, and have her provisions provided for her for a year, in her deceased husband's house. <br /> <br />Later, the <b>Ayah</b> that specified the inheritance (4&#59;12) abrogated this <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240), and thus the widow inherits one-fourth or one-eighth of what her (deceased) husband leaves behind.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim also related that Ali bin Abu Talhah stated that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When a man died and left behind a widow, she used to remain in his house for a year for her <b>Iddah</b>, all the while receiving her provisions during this time. <br /> <br />Thereafter, Allah revealed this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا <br /> (And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days), (2&#59;234). <br /> <br />So, this is the <b>Iddah</b> of the widow, unless she was pregnant, for her <b>Iddah</b> then ends when she gives birth. <br /> <br />Allah also said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَهُنَّ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ الثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم <br /> <br />In that which you leave, their (your wives') share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave. (4&#59;12) <br /> <br />So Allah specified the share of the widow in the inheritance and there was no need for the will or the <b>Nafaqah</b> (maintenance) which were mentioned in (2&#59;240).&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim stated that Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) was abrogated by&#59; <br />أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا <br /> (four months and ten days. (2&#59;234) <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that; <br /> <br />Mujahid said that&#59; <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا <br /> (And those of you who die and leave wives behind them) (2&#59;234) used to be the <b>Iddah</b>, and the widow had to remain with her (deceased) husband's family (during that period, i.e., four months and ten days). Then, Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لاَِّزْوَاجِهِم مَّتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِيَ أَنفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ <br /> <br /> <br />(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance (and residence) without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (e.g., lawful marriage). <br /> <br />So, Allah made the rest of the year, which is seven months and twenty days, as a will and testament for her. Consequently, if she wants, she could use her right in this will and remain in the residence (for the rest of the year). Or, if she wants, she could leave the (deceased husband's) house after the four months and ten days have passed. This is the meaning of what Allah said&#59; <br />غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> (...without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you). <br /> <br />Therefore, the required term of <b>Iddah</b> is still unchanged (refer to 2&#59;234). <br /> <br />Ata quoted Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) has abrogated (the requirement that) the widow spends the <b>Iddah</b> with his (i.e., her deceased husband's) family. So, she spends her <b>Iddah</b> wherever she wants. This is the meaning of what Allah said&#59; <br />غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ <br /> (without turning them out).&#34; <br />Ata also said&#59; <br />&#34;If she wants, she spends the <b>Iddah</b> with his family and resides there according to the will (meaning the rest of the year). If she wants, she is allowed to leave, for Allah said&#59; <br />فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ <br /> (there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves).&#34; <br />Ata then said&#59; <br />&#34;Then (the <b>Ayah</b> on) the inheritance (refer to 4&#59;12) came and abrogated the residence. Hence, the widow spends her <b>Iddah</b> wherever she wants and does not have the right to residence any more.&#34; <br /> <br />The statement of Ata and those who held the view that the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;240) was abrogated by the <b>Ayah</b> on the inheritance (4&#59;12), is only valid for more than the four months and ten days (required in 2&#59;234). However, if they mean that the four months and ten days are not required from the deceased husband's estate, then this opinion is the subject of disagreement among the scholars. <br />As proof, they said that the widow is required to remain in her (deceased) husband's house (for four months and ten days) according to what Malik reported from Zaynab bint Ka`b bin Ujrah. <br />She said that Fari`ah bint Malik bin Sinan, the sister of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, told her that she came to Allah's Messenger asking him to return to her family's residence with Banu Khudrah. Her husband had pursued some of his servants who ran away, but when he reached the area of Al-Qadum, they killed him. <br />She said, &#34;So I asked Allah's Messenger if I should stay with my family in Banu Khudrah, for my (deceased) husband did not leave me a residence that he owns or <b>Nafaqah</b> (maintenance). <br />Allah's Messenger answered in the positive. While I was in the room, Allah's Messenger summoned me or had someone summon me and said&#59; <br /> <br />كَيْفَ قُلْت <br /> <br />What did you say? <br /> <br />I repeated the story to him about my (deceased) husband. <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />امْكُثي فِي بَيْتِكِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الكِتَابُ أَجَلَه <br /> <br />Stay at your home until the term reaches its end. <br /> <br />So I remained through the <b>Iddah</b> term for four months and ten days in my (deceased husband's) house. <br /> <br />Thereafter, Uthman bin Affan sent for me during his reign and asked me about this matter and I told him what happened. He made a judgment to the same effect.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>&#34;. <br /><b>The Necessity of the Mut`ah (Gift) at the Time of Divorce</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 239" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-239/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">240</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>240</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 241" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-241/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=240;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
