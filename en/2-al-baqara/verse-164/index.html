and the disposition of the winds, changing it from south to north, from cold to warm, and the clouds compelled, subjugated by God's command, moving to wherever God wishes, between heaven and the earth, without being attached [to either of the two] -- surely there are signs, indicating His Oneness, exalted be He, for a people who comprehend, [a people] who contemplate.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Proofs for Tawhid</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالَارْضِ <br /> <br />Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth..., <br /> <br />Therefore, the sky, with its height, intricate design, vastness, the heavenly objects in orbit, and this earth, with its density, its lowlands, mountains, seas, deserts, valleys, and other structures, and beneficial things that it has. <br /> <br />Allah continues&#59; <br /> <br />وَاخْتِلَفِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ <br />and in the alternation of night and day. <br /> <br />This (the night) comes and then goes followed by the other (the day) which does not delay for even an instant, just as Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَا الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَأ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلَا الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ <br /> <br />It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit. (36&#59;40) <br /> <br />Sometimes, the day grows shorter and the night longer, and sometimes vice versa, one takes from the length of the other. Similarly Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />يُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ <br /> <br />Allah merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. (57&#59;6) <br /> <br />meaning, He extends the length of one from the other and vice versa. <br /> <br />Allah then continues&#59; <br /> <br />وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ <br />and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, <br /> <br />Shaping the sea in this manner, so that it is able to carry ships from one shore to another, so people benefit from what the other region has, and export what they have to them and vice versa. <br /> <br />Allah then continues&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاء مِن مَّاء فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الارْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا <br />and the water (rain) which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, <br /> <br />which is similar to Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ الاْاَرْضُ الْمَيْتَةُ أَحْيَيْنَاهَا وَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهَا حَبًّا فَمِنْهُ يَأْكُلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />And a sign for them is the dead land. We give it life, and We bring forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof. (36&#59;33), until&#59; <br />وَمِمَّا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> (which they know not). (36&#59;36) <br /> <br />Allah continues&#59; <br /> <br />وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ <br /> <br />and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, <br /> <br />meaning, in various shapes, colors, uses and sizes, whether small or large. Allah knows all that, sustains it, and nothing is concealed from Him. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> <br />And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (<b>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</b> ـ the Book of Decrees with Allah). (11&#59;6) <br /> <br />وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ <br />and in the veering of winds..., <br /> <br />Sometimes, the wind brings mercy and sometimes torment. Sometimes it brings the good news of the clouds that follow it, sometimes it leads the clouds, herding them, scattering them or directing them. Sometimes, the wind comes from the north (the northern wind), and sometimes from the south, sometimes from the east, and striking the front of the <b>Ka`bah</b>, sometimes from the west, striking its back. <br /> <br />There are many books about the wind rain, stars and the regulations related to them, but here is not the place to elaborate on that, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Allah continues&#59; <br /> <br />وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخِّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاء وَالَارْضِ <br />and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, <br /> <br />The clouds run between the sky and the earth to wherever Allah wills of lands and areas. <br /> <br />Allah said next&#59; <br /> <br />لاايَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />are indeed <b>Ayat</b> for people of understanding. <br /> <br />meaning, all these things are clear signs that testify to Allah's Oneness. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفِ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لاّيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى الاٌّلْبَـبِ <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ قِيَـماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَى جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِى خَلْقِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبَّنَأ مَا خَلَقْتَ هَذا بَـطِلً سُبْحَـنَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ <br /> <br />Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. <br /> <br />Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying)&#59;&#34;Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted are You above all that they associate with You as partners). Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire.&#34; (3&#59;190-191</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 163" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-163/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">164</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>164</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 165" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-165/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
