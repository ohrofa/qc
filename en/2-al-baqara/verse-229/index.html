And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself.

J. Arberry</h3><p>Divorce is twice; then honourable retention or setting free kindly. It is not lawful for you to take of what you have given them unless the couple fear they may not maintain God's bounds; if you fear they may not maintain God's bounds, it is no fault in them for her to redeem herself. Those are God's bounds; do not transgress them. Whosoever transgresses the bounds of God -- those are the evildoers.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Divorce can happen twice, and [each time] wives either be kept on in an acceptable manner or released in a good way. It is not lawful for you to take back anything that you have given [your wives], except where both fear that they cannot maintain [the marriage] within the bounds set by God: if you [arbiters] suspect that the couple may not be able to do this, then there will be no blame on either of them if the woman opts to give something for her release. These are the bounds set by God: do not overstep them. It is those who overstep God’s bounds who are doing wrong.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Divorcement is twice: thereafter either retaining her reputably, or letting her off kindly. And it is not allowed unto you to take away aught ye have given them, except the twain fear that they may not observe the bonds of Allah. If yes fear that the twain may not observe the bonds of Allah, then no blame is on the twain for that where with she ransometh herself. These are the bonds of Allah, wherefore trespass them not; and whosoever trespasseth the bonds of Allah, then verily these! they are the wrong-doers.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>A divorce is only permissible twice&#59; after that, the parties should either hold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others).</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Divorce may be pronounced twice; then either the wife be kept honourably or parted with gracefully. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything out of what you have given them. There is, however, an exception to this; if you fear that they might not be able to keep within the limits imposed by Allah, there is no harm if both agree mutually that the wife should obtain divorce by giving something as compensation to the husband. These are the bounds set by Allah; therefore do not violate them, for those who violate the bounds of AIIah are the tansgressors.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself. Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>This type of divorce is up to twice; the woman must then be retained on good terms or released with kindness; and it is not lawful for you to take back from women a part of what you have given them except when both fear that they may not be able to stay within the limits established by Allah; so if you fear that they may not be able to observe the limits of Allah, then it is no sin on them if the woman pays to get her release; these are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them; and those who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>[Revocable] divorce may be only twice; then [let there be] either an honourable retention, or a kindly release. It is not lawful for you to take back anything from what you have given them, unless the couple fear that they may not maintain Allah’s bounds; so if you fear they would not maintain Allah’s bounds, there is no sin upon them in what she may give to secure her own release. These are Allah’s bounds, so do not transgress them, and whoever transgresses the bounds of Allah—it is they who are the wrongdoers.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Divorce is (to be) pronounced twice. Then (at the end of each pronouncement) the husband should either retain (his wife) without offending her honor and in a fair manner, or release (her) kindly and in a manner fairer and pleasing (to her). (In the event of divorce) it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them (as bridal-due or wedding gift or gifts on other occasions), unless both fear that they might not be able to keep within the bounds set by God. If you fear that they might not be able to keep within the bounds set by God (and deviate into unlawful acts particularly because of the wife’s disgust with the husband), there is no blame on them that the wife might pay some compensation to be released from the marriage tie. Those are the bounds set by God, therefore do not exceed them. Whoever exceeds the bounds set by God, such are wrongdoers.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Such a (revocable) divorce may be (pronounced) twice, then, (after the second pronouncement) there should be either retaining (the wife) with honour and fairness or letting (her) leave with goodness. And it is not lawful for you to take (back) anything of what you have given them (your wives); however, if both (the husband and the wife) fear that they cannot abide by the injunctions of Allâh, and if you (- the Muslim community, also) fear that they cannot observe the limits (prescribed) by Allâh then there is no blame on either of them in what she gives up to redeem herself (as Khula`).

It is not lawful for you, O male spouses, to take of what you have given them, of dowry, if you divorce them, unless the, married, couple fear that they may not maintain God's bounds, that is to say, that they will not honour the rights God has established for them (a variant reading [for yakhf, `they (dual form) fear'] has yukhf, with the direct object taking the accusative ending; all yuqm is an inclusive substitution for the person [governing the verb]; both verbs are also read in the second person [sc. takhf, `you fear', tuqm, `you maintain']). If you fear they may not maintain God's bounds, neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself, of some money, so that he should divorce her. In other words, in this instance, there is no culpability either for the man, should he take of the dowry, or for the woman, should she offer of it. Those, prescriptions mentioned, are God's bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God's bounds -- those are the evildoers.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Divorce is Thrice</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />الطَّلَقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ <br />The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness. <br />This honorable <b>Ayah</b> abrogated the previous practice in the beginning of Islam, when the man had the right to take back his divorced wife even if he had divorced her a hundred times, as long as she was still in her <b>Iddah</b> (waiting period). This situation was harmful for the wife, and this is why Allah made the divorce thrice, where the husband is allowed to take back his wife after the first and the second divorce (as long as she is still in her <b>Iddah</b>). <br />The divorce becomes irrevocable after the third divorce, as Allah said&#59;<b> <br />الطَّلَقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ <br /></b> (The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness). <br />In his <b>Sunan</b>, Abu Dawud reported in Chapter&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Taking the Wife back after the third (Divorce) is an abrogated practice,&#34; that Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;<b> <br />وَالْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَثَةَ قُرُوَءٍ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللّهُ فِي أَرْحَامِهِنَّ <br /></b> (And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,) (2&#59;228). The man used to have the right to take back his wife even if he had divorced her thrice. Allah abrogated this and said&#59;<b> <br />الطَّلَقُ مَرَّتَانِ <br /></b> (The divorce is twice). <br /> <br />This <b>Tafsir</b> was also collected by An-Nasa'i. <br />Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Urwah said that a man said to his wife, <br />&#34;I will neither divorce you nor take you back.&#34; <br />She said, &#34;How?&#34; <br />He said, &#34;I will divorce you and when your term of <b>Iddah</b> nears its end, I will take you back.&#34; <br />She went to Allah's Messenger and told him what happened, and Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />الطَّلَقُ مَرَّتَانِ <br /></b> (The divorce is twice). <br />Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) also reported this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Tafsir</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ <br />after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness, <br /> <br />meaning, `If you divorce her once or twice, you have the choice to take her back, as long as she is still in her <b>Iddah</b>, intending to be kind to her and to mend differences. Otherwise, await the end of her term of <b>Iddah</b>, when the divorce becomes final, and let her go her own way in peace, without committing any harm or injustice against her.' <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the man divorces his wife twice, let him fear Allah, regarding the third time. He should either keep her with him and treat her with kindness, or let her go her own way with kindness, without infringing upon any of her rights.&#34; <br /><b>Taking back the Mahr (Dowry)</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّا اتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْيًا <br />And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of (the dowry) what you gave them, <br /> <br />meaning, you are not allowed to bother or pressure your wives to end this situation by giving you back the <b>Mahr</b> and any gifts that you have given them (in return for divorce). <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَأ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ <br />and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of what you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse. (4&#59;19) <br /> <br />However, if the wife willingly gives back anything with a good heart, then Allah said regarding this situation&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيياً مَّرِيياً <br />but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm. (4&#59;4) <br /><b>Allowing Khul` and the Return of the Mahr in that Case</b> <br /> <br />When the spouses have irreconcilable differences wherein the wife ignores the rights of the husband, dislikes him and becomes unable to live with him any longer, she is allowed to free herself (from married life) by giving him back what he had given her (in gifts and <b>Mahr</b>). There is no sin on her in this case nor on him if he accepts such offer. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّا اتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْيًا إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَا أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللّهِ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ <br />And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what you gave them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g., to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back. <br /> <br />Sometimes, the woman has no valid reason and she still asks for her marriage to be ended. In this case, Ibn Jarir reported that Thawban said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيُّمَا امْرَأَةٍ سَأَلَتْ زَوْجَهَا طَلَقًا فِي غَيْرِ مَا بَأْسٍ فَحَرَامٌ عَلَيْهَا رَايِحَةُ الْجَنَّـة <br />Any woman who asks her husband for divorce without justification, then the scent of Paradise will be forbidden for her. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded this <b>Hadith</b> and stated that it is <b>Hasan</b>. <br />Ibn Jarir said that; <br />the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;229) was revealed about Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and his wife Habibah bint Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. <br />In his <b>Muwatta</b>, Imam Malik reported that; <br /> <br />Habibah bint Sahl Al-Ansariyah was married to Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and that Allah's Messenger once went to the <b>Fajr</b> (Dawn) prayer and found Habibah bint Sahl by his door in the dark. Allah's Messenger said, &#34;Who is this?&#34; <br />She said, &#34;I am Habibah bint Sahl, O Messenger of Allah!&#34; <br />He said, &#34;What is the matter?&#34; <br />She said, &#34;I and Thabit bin Qays&#34;, meaning, (she can no longer be with) her husband. <br />When her husband Thabit bin Qays came, Allah's Messenger said to him&#59; <br /> <br />هذِهِ حَبِيبَةُ بِنْتُ سَهْلٍ قَدْ ذَكَرَتْ مَا شَاءَ اللهُ أَنْ تَذْكُر <br />This is Habibah bint Sahl, she said what Allah has permitted her to say. <br /> <br />Habibah also said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! I still have everything he gave me.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />خُذْ مِنْهَا <br />Take it from her. <br />So, he took it from her and she remained in her family's house.&#34; <br />This was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported that; <br />Ibn Abbas said that the wife of Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas came to the Prophet and said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! I do not criticize his religion or mannerism. But I hate committing <b>Kufr</b> in Islam (by ignoring his rights on her).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />أَتَرُدِّينَ عَلَيهِ حَدِيقَتَه <br />Will you give him back his garden? <br />She said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />اقْبَلِ الْحَدِيقَةَ وَطَلِّقْهَا تَطْلِيقَة <br />Take back the garden and divorce her once. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i also recorded it. <br /><b>The `Iddah (Waiting Period) for the Khul&#34;</b> <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi reported that; <br /> <br />Rubayi bint Mu`awwidh bin Afra got a <b>Khul</b> during the time of Allah's Messenger and the Prophet ordered her to wait for one menstruation period for <b>Iddah</b>. <br /><b>Transgressing the set limits of Allah is an Injustice</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللّهِ فَلَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللّهِ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the wrongdoers. <br /> <br />This means that the laws that Allah has legislated are His set limits, so do not transgress them. <br />An authentic Hadith states&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ حَدَّ حُدُودًا فَلَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وفَرَضَ فَرَايِضَ فَلَ تُضَيِّعُوهَا وحَرَّمَ مَحَارِمَ فَلَ تَنْتَهِكُوهَا وَسَكَتَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ رَحْمَةً لَكُمْ مِنْ غَيْرِ نِسْيَانٍ فَلَ تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا <br /> <br />Allah has set some limits, so do not transgress them; and commanded some commands, so do not ignore them; and made some things unlawful, so do not commit them. He has also left some matters (without rulings) as a mercy with you, not because He has forgotten them, so do not ask about them. <br /><b>Pronouncing Three Divorces at the same Time is Unlawful</b> <br />The last <b>Ayah</b> we mentioned was used as evidence to prove that it is not allowed to pronounce three divorces at one time. What further proves this ruling is that Mahmud bin Labid has stated - as An-Nasa'i recorded - that Allah's Messenger was told about a man who pronounced three divorces on his wife at one time, so the Prophet stood up while angry and said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيُلْعَبُ بِكِتَابِ اللهِ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُم <br />The Book of Allah is being made the subject of jest while I am still amongst you. <br />A man then stood up and said, &#34;Should I kill that man, O Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /><b>The Wife cannot be taken back after the Third Divorce</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 228" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-228/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">229</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>229</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 230" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-230/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
