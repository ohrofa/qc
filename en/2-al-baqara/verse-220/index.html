In (to) this worldly life and in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />meaning, just as He stated and explained these commandments for you, He also explains the rest of His <b>Ayat</b> regarding the commandments and His promises and warnings, so that you might give thought in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Meaning about the imminent demise and the brevity of this life, and the imminent commencement of the Hereafter and its continuity.&#34; <br /><b>Maintaining the Orphan's Property</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَامَى قُلْ إِصْلَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَاللّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ الْمُصْلِحِ وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لاعْنَتَكُمْ <br /> <br />And they ask you concerning orphans. <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. And Allah knows him who means mischief (e.g., to swallow their property) from him who means good (e.g., to save their property). And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the <b>Ayat</b>&#59;<b> <br />وَلَا تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ <br /></b> (And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it), (6&#59;152) and <b> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ الْيَتَامَى ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا <br /></b> (Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!) (4&#59;10) were revealed, those who took care of some orphans, separated their food and drink from the orphans' food and drink. When some of the orphans' food and drink remained, they would keep it for them until they eat it or otherwise get spoiled. <br /> <br />This situation was difficult for them and they mentioned this subject to Allah's Messenger. <br /> <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَامَى قُلْ إِصْلَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ <br /> <br />And they ask you concerning orphans. Say&#59;&#34;The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. <br /> <br />Hence, they joined their food and drink with the food and drink of the orphans.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim in his <b>Mustadrak</b>. <br /> <br />Several others said similarly about the circumstances surrounding the revelation of the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;220), including Mujahid, Ata, Ash-Sha`bi, Ibn Abu Layla, Qatadah and others among the <b>Salaf</b> and those after them. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I dislike that an orphan's money be under my care, unless I mix my food with his food and my drink with his drink.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />قُلْ إِصْلَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ <br /> <br />Say&#59;The best thing is to work honestly in their property. <br /> <br />meaning, on the one hand (i.e., this is required in any case). <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ <br />and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. <br /> <br />meaning, there is no harm if you mix your food and drink with their food and drink, since they are your brothers in the religion. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said afterwards&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ الْمُصْلِحِ <br /> <br />And Allah knows (the one) who means mischief (e.g., to swallow their property) from (the one) who means good (e.g., to save their property). <br /> <br />meaning, He knows those whose intent is to cause mischief or righteousness. <br /> <br />He also said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لاعْنَتَكُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. Truly, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. <br /> <br />meaning, if Allah wills, He will make this matter difficult for you. But, He made it easy for you, and allowed you to mix your affairs with the orphans' affairs in a way that is better. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ <br /> <br />And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it. (6&#59;152) <br /> <br />Allah has thus allowed spending from the orphan's estate by its executor, in reasonable proportions, on the condition that he has the intention to compensate the orphan later on, when he can afford it. We will mention about it in detail in Surah <b>An-Nisa</b> by Allah's will</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 219" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-219/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">220</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>220</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 221" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-221/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=220;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
