He brings them out from darknesses into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their <b>Awliya</b>' (supporters and helpers) are <b>Taghut</b> (false deities and false leaders), they bring them out from light into darknesses. <br /> <br />Allah stated that whoever follows what pleases Him, He will guide him to the paths of peace, that is Islam, or Paradise. Verily, Allah delivers His believing servants from the darkness of disbelief, doubt and hesitation, to the light of the plain, clear, explained, easy and unequivocal truth. <br /> <br />He also stated that <b>Shaytan</b> is the supporter of the disbelievers who beautifies the paths of ignorance and misguidance that they follow, thus causing them to deviate from the true path into disbelief and wickedness. <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever. <br /> <br />This is why Allah mentioned the light in the singular while mentioned the darkness in the plural, because truth is one, while disbelief comes as several types, all of which are false. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ذَلِكُمْ وَصَّـكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may have <b>Taqwa</b>. (6&#59;153) <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَـتِ وَالنُّورَ <br /> <br />And originated the darknesses and the light. (6&#59;1) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ <br /> <br />to the right and to the lefts. (16&#59;48) <br /> <br />There are many other <b>Ayat</b> on the subject that mention the truth in the singular and falsehood in the plural, because of falsehood's many divisions and branches</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 256" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-256/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">257</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>257</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 258" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-258/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=257;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
