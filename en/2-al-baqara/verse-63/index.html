Allah stated that when He took their pledge from them, He raised the mountain above their heads, so that they affirm the pledge that they gave Allah and abide by it with sincerity and seriousness. Hence, Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذ نَتَقْنَا الْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ خُذُواْ مَأ ءَاتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ <br /> <br />And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said)&#59;&#34;Hold firmly to what We have given you (<b>Tawrah</b>), and remember that which is therein (act on its commandments), so that you may fear Allah and obey Him.&#34; (7&#59;171). <br /> <br />The mount mentioned here is <b>At-Tur</b>, just as it was explained in Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b>, according to the Tafsir of Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ata, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and others. This is more obvious. <br /> <br />There is another report from Ibn Abbas saying; <br /> <br />`The <b>Tur</b> is a type of mountain that vegetation grows on, if no vegetation grows on it, it is not called <b>Tur</b>.' <br /> <br />And in the <b>Hadith</b> about the trials, Ibn Abbas said; <br /> <br />&#34;When they (the Jews) refused to obey, Allah raised the mountain above their heads so that they would listen.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement, <br />خُذُواْ مَا اتَيْنَاكُم بِقُوَّةٍ <br /> (Hold fast to that which We have given you), <br /> <br />means, the <b>Tawrah</b>. <br /> <br />Mujahid said that the <b>Ayah</b> commanded, <br /> <br />&#34;Strictly adhere to it.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah and Ar-Rabi said that, <br />وَاذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> (and remember that which is therein) means, <br /> <br />&#34;Read the <b>Tawrah</b> and implement it.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 62" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-62/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">63</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>63</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 64" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-64/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
