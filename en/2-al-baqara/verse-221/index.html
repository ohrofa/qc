(5&#59;5) <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn Abbas said about what Allah said&#59; <br />وَلَا تَنكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّى يُوْمِنَّ <br /> (And do not marry <b>Al</b>-<b>Mushrikat</b> (female idolators) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). <br /> <br />&#34;Allah has excluded the women of the People of the Scripture.&#34; This is also the explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Makhul, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others. <br /> <br />Some scholars said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> is exclusively talking about idol worshippers and not the People of the Scripture, and this meaning is similar to the first meaning we mentioned. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Abu Jafar bin Jarir (At-Tabari) said, after mentioning that there is <b>Ijma</b> that marrying women from the People of the Scripture is allowed, <br /> <br />&#34;Umar disliked this practice so that the Muslims do not refrain from marrying Muslim women, or for similar reasons.&#34; <br /> <br />An authentic chain of narrators stated that Shaqiq said&#59; <br /> <br />Once Hudhayfah married a Jewish woman and Umar wrote to him, &#34;Divorce her.&#34; <br /> <br />He wrote back, &#34;Do you claim that she is not allowed for me so that I divorce her?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;No. But, I fear that you might marry the whores from among them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir related that Zayd bin Wahb said that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Khattab said, &#34;The Muslim man marries the Christian woman, but the Christian man does not marry the Muslim woman.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has a stronger, authentic chain of narrators than the previous <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim said that; <br /> <br />Ibn Umar disliked marrying the women from the People of the Scripture. He relied on his own explanation for the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَلَا تَنكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّى يُوْمِنَّ <br /> (And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (female idolators) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also reported that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I do not know of a bigger Shirk than her saying that Jesus is her Lord!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَامَةٌ مُّوْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ <br /> <br />And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) <b>Mushrikah</b> (female idolators), even though she pleases you. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />تُنْـكَحُ الْمَرْأَةُ لاَِرْبَعٍ <br /> <br />لِمَالِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِحَسَبِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِجَمَالِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِدِينِهَا <br /> <br />فَاظْفَرْ بِذَاتِ الدِّينِ تَرِبَتْ يَدَاك <br /> <br />A woman is chosen for marriage for four reasons&#59; <br /> <br />her wealth, <br /> <br />social status, <br /> <br />beauty, and <br /> <br />religion. <br /> <br />So, marry the religious woman, may your hands be filled with sand (a statement of encouragement). <br /> <br />Muslim reported this <b>Hadith</b> from Jabir. <br /> <br />Muslim also reported that Ibn Amr said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِ الدُّنْيَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَة <br /> <br />The life of this world is but a delight, and the best of the delights of this earthly life is the righteous wife. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُنكِحُواْ الْمُشِرِكِينَ حَتَّى يُوْمِنُواْ <br /> <br />And give not (your daughters) in marriage to <b>Al-Mushrikin</b> till they believe (in Allah Alone). <br /> <br />meaning, do not marry <b>Mushrik</b> men to believing women. <br /> <br />This statement is similar to Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />لَا هُنَّ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحِلُّونَ لَهُنَّ <br /> <br />They are not lawful (wives) for them, nor are they lawful (husbands) for them. (60&#59;10) <br /> <br />Next, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّوْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ <br />and verily, a believing servant is better than a (free) <b>Mushrik</b> (idolator), even though he pleases you. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that a believing man, even an Abyssinian servant, is better than a <b>Mushrik</b> man, even if he was a rich master. <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ <br /> <br />Those (<b>Al-Mushrikun</b>) invite you to the Fire, <br /> <br />meaning, associating and mingling with the disbelievers makes one love this life and prefer it over the Hereafter, leading to the severest repercussions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَدْعُوَ إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَالْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ <br />but Allah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His leave, <br /> <br />meaning, by His Law, commandments and prohibitions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br />and makes His <b>Ayat</b> clear to mankind that they may remember</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 220" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-220/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">221</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>221</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Baqarah Verse 222" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-222/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=221;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
