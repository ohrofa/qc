Inform them of their names&#34;), <br /> <br />&#34;The name of the pigeon, the crow and everything.&#34; <br /> <br />Statements of a similar meaning were reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah. <br /> <br />When Adam's virtue over the angels became apparent, as he mentioned the names that Allah taught him, Allah said to the angels, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالَارْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />Did I not tell you that I know the <b>Ghayb</b> (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing! <br /> <br />This means, &#34;Did I not state that I know the seen and unseen matters.&#34; <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى <br /> <br />And if you (O Muhammad) speak (the invocation) aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden. (20&#59;7) <br /> <br />Also, Allah said about the hoopoe, that it said to Suleiman; <br /> <br />أَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ الَّذِى يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ <br /> <br />اللَّهُ لَا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ <br /> <br />(As <b>Shaytan</b> (Satan) has barred them from Allah's way) so they do not prostrate before Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Allah, <b>La ilaha illa Huwa</b> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne! (27&#59;25-26) <br /> <br />They also have comments other than what we have said about the meaning of Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />And I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing. <br /> <br />It is reported from Ad-Dahhak that Ibn Abbas said that it means, <br /> <br />&#34;`I know the secrets, just as I know the apparent things, such as, what Iblis concealed in his heart of arrogance and pride.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated that Ar-Rabi bin Anas said that, <b> <br />وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ <br /></b> (And I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing) means, <br /> <br />&#34;The apparent part of what they said was&#59;`Do you create in it that which would commit mischief and shed blood!' <br /> <br />The hidden meaning was&#59;`We have more knowledge and honor than any creation our Lord would create.' <br /> <br />But they came to know that Allah favored Adam above them regarding knowledge and honor.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 32" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 34" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
