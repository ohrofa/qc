It is reported from Ibn `Abbs that this pacing [between the two] is not obligatory, based on the fact that when no sin can be incurred, the context implies free choice. Al-Shfi` and others, however, considered it to be a pillar [of the Pilgrimage rituals]. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aspect when he said that, `God has prescribed for you the pacing [sa`y]', as reported by al-Bayhaq and others; and he [the Prophet] also said, `Begin with what God has begun', meaning, al-Saf, as reported by Muslim; and whoever volunteers (tatawwa`a&#59; a variant reading is yattawa`, the ta' here being assimilated) good, that is, any good deed such as circumambulation or other, that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful, for such a deed and rewards that person for it, Knowing, it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Meaning of &#34;it is not a sin&#34; in the Ayah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says <br /> <br />إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَأيِرِ اللّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> are of the symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs <b>Hajj</b> or <b>Umrah</b> (pilgrimage) of the House to perform <b>Tawaf</b> between them. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Urwah said that he asked Aishah about what Allah stated&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah! It is not a sin if someone did not perform <b>Tawaf</b> around them.&#34; <br /> <br />Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Worst is that which you said, O my nephew! If this is the meaning of it, it should have read, `It is not a sin if one did not perform <b>Tawaf</b> around them.' <br /> <br />Rather, the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed regarding the <b>Ansar</b>, who before Islam, used to assume <b>Ihlal</b> (or <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b>) in the area of Mushallal for their idol <b>Manat</b> that they used to worship. Those who assumed <b>Ihlal</b> for <b>Manat</b>, used to hesitate to perform <b>Tawaf</b> (going) between Mounts <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>. So they (during the Islamic era) asked Allah's Messenger about it, saying, `O Messenger of Allah! During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, we used to hesitate to perform <b>Tawaf</b> between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>.' <br /> <br />Allah then revealed&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَأيِرِ اللّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> are of the symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs <b>Hajj</b> or <b>Umrah</b> of the House to perform the going (<b>Tawaf</b>) between them.&#34; <br /> <br />Aishah then said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger has made it the <b>Sunnah</b> to perform <b>Tawaf</b> between them (<b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>), and thus, no one should abandon performing <b>Tawaf</b> between them.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is reported in the <b>Sahihayn</b>. <br /> <br />In another narration, Imam Az-Zuhri reported that Urwah said&#59; <br /> <br />Later on I (Urwah) told Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham (of Aishah's statement) and he said, <br /> <br />&#34;I have not heard of such information. However, I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom Aishah mentioned, said, `Our <b>Tawaf</b> between these two hills is a practice of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>.' <br /> <br />Some others among the <b>Ansar</b> said, `We were commanded to perform <b>Tawaf</b> of the <b>Ka`bah</b>, but not between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>.' So Allah revealed&#59; <br />إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَأيِرِ اللّهِ <br /> (Verily, <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> are of the symbols of Allah).&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman then said, <br /> <br />&#34;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari collected a similar narration by Anas. <br /> <br />Ash-Sha`bi said, <br /> <br />&#34;Isaf (an idol) was on <b>As-Safa</b> while Na'ilah (an idol) was on <b>Al-Marwah</b>, and they used to touch (or kiss) them. After Islam came, they were hesitant about performing <b>Tawaf</b> between them. Thereafter, the Ayah (2&#59;158 above) was revealed.&#34; <br /><b>The Wisdom behind legislating Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah</b> <br /> <br />Muslim recorded a long <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Sahih</b> from Jabir, in which Allah's Messenger finished the <b>Tawaf</b> around the House, and then went back to the <b>Rukn</b> (pillar, i.e., the Black Stone) and kissed it. He then went out from the door near <b>As-Safa</b> while reciting&#59; <br />إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَأيِرِ اللّهِ <br /> (Verily, <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> are of the symbols of Allah). <br /> <br />The Prophet then said, (I start with what Allah has commanded me to start with (meaning start the <b>Sa`i</b> (i.e., fast walking) from the <b>As-Safa</b>). <br /> <br />In another narration of An-Nasa'i, the Prophet said, (Start with what Allah has started with (i.e., <b>As-Safa</b>)). <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Habibah bint Abu Tajrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Allah's Messenger performing <b>Tawaf</b> between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>, while the people were in front of him and he was behind them walking in <b>Sa`i</b>. I saw his garment twisted around his knees because of the fast walking in <b>Sa`i</b> (he was performing) and he was reciting&#59; <br /> <br />اسْعَوْا فَإِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ السَّعْي <br /> <br />Perform <b>Sa`i</b>, for Allah has prescribed <b>Sa`i</b> on you.&#34;' <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was used as a proof for the fact that <b>Sa`i</b> is a <b>Rukn</b> of <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />It was also said that; <br /><b>Sa`i</b> is <b>Wajib</b>, and not a <b>Rukn</b> of <b>Hajj</b> and that if one does not perform it by mistake or by intention, he could expiate the shortcoming with <b>Damm</b>. <br /> <br />Allah has stated that <b>Tawaf</b> between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> is among the symbols of Allah, meaning, among the acts that Allah legislated during the <b>Hajj</b> for Prophet Ibrahim. <br /> <br />Earlier we mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> by Ibn Abbas that the origin of <b>Tawaf</b> comes from the <b>Tawaf</b> of Hajar (Prophet Ibrahim's wife), between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> seeking water for her son (Ismail). Ibrahim had left them in Makkah, where there was no habitation for her. When Hajar feared that her son would die, she stood up and begged Allah for His help and kept going back and forth in that blessed area between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>. She was humble, fearful, frightened and meek before Allah. Allah answered her prayers, relieved her of her loneliness, ended her dilemma and made the well of <b>Zamzam</b> bring forth its water for her, which is&#59; <br /> <br />طَعَامُ طُعْمٍ وَشِفَاءُ سُقْم <br /> <br />A tasty (or nutritional) food and a remedy for the illness. <br /> <br />Therefore, whoever performs <b>Sa`i</b> between <b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b> should remember his meekness, humbleness and need for Allah to guide his heart, lead his affairs to success and forgive his sins. He should also want Allah to eliminate his shortcomings and errors and to guide him to the straight path. He should ask Allah to keep him firm on this path until he meets death, and to change his situation from that of sin and errors to that of perfection and being forgiven, --- the same providence which was provided to Hajar. <br /> <br />Allah then states&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا <br /> <br />And whoever does good voluntarily. <br /> <br />It was said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> describes performing <b>Tawaf</b> more than seven times, <br /> <br />it was also said that; <br /> <br />it refers to voluntary <b>Umrah</b> or <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />It was also said that; <br /> <br />it means volunteering to do good works in general, as Ar-Razi has stated. <br /> <br />The third opinion was attributed to Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Allah states&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ اللّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br />then verily, Allah is All-Recognizer, All-Knower. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah's reward is immense for the little deed, and He knows about the sufficiency of the reward. Hence, He will not award insufficient rewards to anyone. <br /> <br />Indeed&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُوْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً <br /> <br />Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.
