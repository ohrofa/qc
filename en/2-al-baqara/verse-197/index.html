This was reported from Ibn Abbas, Jabir, Ata, Tawus and Mujahid. <br /> <br />The proof for this is Allah's statement that <b>Hajj</b> occurs during known, specific months, which indicates that <b>Hajj</b> is not allowed before that, just as the prayer has a fixed time (before which one's prayer is not accepted). <br /> <br />Ash-Shafii recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;No person should assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> before the months of the <b>Hajj</b>, for Allah said&#59; <br />الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ <br /> (The <b>Hajj</b> is (in) the well-known months). <br /> <br />Ibn Khuzaymah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;No <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> should be assumed, except during the months of <b>Hajj</b>, for among the <b>Sunnah</b> of <b>Hajj</b> is that one assume <b>Ihram</b> for it during the <b>Hajj</b> months.&#34; <br /> <br />This is an authentic narration and the Companion's statement that such and such is among the <b>Sunnah</b> is considered as a <b>Hadith</b> of the Prophet, according to the majority of the scholars. This is especially the case when it is Ibn Abbas who issued this statement, as he is the <b>Tarjuman</b> (translator, interpreter, explainer) of the Qur'an. <br /> <br />There is a <b>Hadith</b> about this subject too. <br /> <br />Ibn Marduwyah related that Jabir narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَنْبَغِي لاِاَحَدٍ أَنْ يُحْرِمَ بِالْحَجِّ إِلاَّ فِي أَشْهُرِ الْحَج <br /> <br />No one should assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b>, but during the months of <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />The chain of narrators for this <b>Hadith</b> is reasonable. <br /> <br />Ash-Shafii and Al-Bayhaqi recorded this <b>Hadith</b> from Ibn Jurayj who related that Abu Az-Zubayr said that he heard Jabir bin Abdullah being asked, <br /> <br />&#34;Does one assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> before the months of the Hajj?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />This narration is more reliable than the narration that we mentioned from the Prophet. <br /> <br />In short, this statement is the opinion of the Companion, supported by Ibn Abbas statement that it is a part of the <b>Sunnah</b> not to assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> before the months of the <b>Hajj</b>. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /><b>The Months of Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ <br />the well-known months. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said that Ibn Umar said that; <br /> <br />these are Shawwal, <b>Dhul-Qadah</b> and the first ten days of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>. <br /> <br />This narration for which Al-Bukhari did not mention the chain of narrators, was collected by a continuous chain of narrators that Ibn Jarir rendered authentic, leading to Ibn Umar, who said&#59; <br />الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ <br /> (The <b>Hajj</b> (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months), <br /> <br />&#34;which are <b>Shawwal</b>,<b>Dhul-Qadah</b> and the (first) ten days of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Its chain is <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Hakim also recorded it in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, and he said, &#34;It meets the criteria of the Two Sheikhs.&#34; <br /> <br />This statement is also reported from Umar, Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, Ibn Abbas, Ata, Tawus, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Imam Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Makhul, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />This opinion was preferred by Ibn Jarir who said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is a common practice to call two months and a part of the third month as `months'. This is similar to the Arab's saying, `I visited such and such person this year or this day.' He only visited him during a part of the year and a part of the day. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br />فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him), (2&#59;203). <br /> <br />In this case, one will only be hastening for one and a half days.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ <br /> <br />So whosoever intends (<b>Farada</b>) to perform <b>Hajj</b> therein (by assuming <b>Ihram</b>), <br /> <br />meaning that one's assuming the <b>Ihram</b> requires a <b>Hajj</b>, for the person is required to complete the rituals of <b>Hajj</b> after assuming <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said that Al-Awfi said, <br /> <br />&#34;The scholars agree that (<b>Farada</b>) `intends' mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> means it is a requirement and an obligation.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;<b> <br />فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ <br /></b> (So whosoever intends to perform <b>Hajj</b> therein (by assuming <b>Ihram</b>)), refers to those who assume <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ata said, <br /> <br />&#34;'Intends', means, assumes the <b>Ihram</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar statements were attributed to Ibrahim, Ad-Dahhak and others. <br /><b>Prohibition of Rafath (Sexual Intercourse) during Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَ رَفَثَ <br /> <br />He should not have <b>Rafath</b>, <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means that those who assume the <b>Ihram</b> for <b>Hajj</b> or <b>Umrah</b> are required to avoid the <b>Rafath</b>, meaning, sexual intercourse. <br /> <br />Allah's statement here is similar to His statement&#59; <br /> <br />أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَأيِكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />It is made lawful for you to have <b>Rafath</b> (sexual relations) with your wives on the night of the fast. (2&#59;187) <br /> <br />Whatever might lead to sexual intercourse, such as embracing, kissing and talking to women about similar subjects, is not allowed. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Nafi narrated that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Rafath</b> means sexual intercourse or mentioning this subject with the tongue, by either men or women.&#34; <br /> <br />Ata bin Abu Rabah said that, <br /><b>Rafath</b> means sexual intercourse and foul speech. <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Amr bin Dinar. <br /> <br />Ata also said that they used to even prevent talking (or hinting) about this subject. <br /> <br />Tawus said that <b>Rafath</b> includes one's saying, <br /> <br />&#34;When I end the Ihram I will have sex with you.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the same explanation offered by Abu Al-Aliyah regarding <b>Rafath</b>. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Rafath</b> means having sex with the wife, kissing, fondling and saying foul words to her, and similar acts.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and Ibn Umar said that; <br /><b>Rafath</b> means to have sex with women. <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Abu Al-Aliyah who narrated it from Ata and Makhul, Ata Al-Khurasani, Ata' bin Yasar, Atiyah, Ibrahim, Ar-Rabi, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Malik bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Abdul-Karim bin Malik, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak, and others. <br /><b>The Prohibition of Fusuq during Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا فُسُوقَ <br />nor commit sin, <br /> <br />Miqsam and several other scholars related that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is disobedience.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Ata, Mujahid, Tawus, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Ata bin Yasar, Ata Al-Khurasani and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />Ibn Wahb reported that Nafi` narrated that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Fusuq</b> (or sin mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;197)) refers to committing what Allah has forbidden in the Sacred Area.&#34; <br /> <br />Several others said that; <br /><b>Fusuq</b> means cursing others, they based this on the authentic Hadith&#59; <br /> <br />سِبَابُ الْمُسْلِمِ فُسُوقٌ وَقِتَالُهُ كُفْر <br /> <br />Cursing the Muslim is <b>Fusuq</b>, while fighting him is <b>Kufr</b>. <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said; <br /><b>Fusuq</b> here means slaughtering animals for the idols, as Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَوْ فِسْقًا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ <br />or impious (<b>Fisq</b>) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah. (6&#59;145) <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that; <br /><b>Fusuq</b> is insulting one another with bad nicknames. <br /> <br />Those who said that the <b>Fusuq</b> means all types of disobedience are correct. Allah has also prohibited committing injustice during the months of <b>Hajj</b> in specific, although injustice is prohibited throughout the year. This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مِنْهَأ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ذلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ فَلَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ <br />of them four are sacred. That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein. (9&#59;36) <br /> <br />Allah said about the Sacred Area&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <br />and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment. (22&#59;25) <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ حَجَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتَ فَلَمْ يَرْفُثْ وَلَمْ يَفْسُقْ خَرَجَ مِنْ ذُنُوبِهِ كَيَوْمَ وَلَدَتْهُ أُمُّه <br /> <br />Whoever performed <b>Hajj</b> to this (Sacred) House and did not commit <b>Rafath</b> or <b>Fusuq</b>, will return sinless, just as the day his mother gave birth to him. <br /><b>The Prohibition of arguing during Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ <br /> <br />nor should there be <b>Jidal</b> during <b>Hajj</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, disputes and arguments. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir related that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that; <br /> <br />what Allah said&#59; <br />وَلَا جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ <br /> (...nor dispute unjustly during the <b>Hajj</b>) means to argue with your companion (or fellow) until you make him angry. <br /> <br />This is similar to the the opinion that Miqsam and Ad-Dahhak related to Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />This is also the same meaning reported from Abu Al-Aliyah, Ata, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Jabir bin Zayd, Ata Al-Khurasani, Makhul, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Amr bin Dinar, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Ata bin Yasar, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. <br /><b>The Encouragement for Righteous Deeds and to bring Provisions for Hajj</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />And whatever good you do, Allah knows it. <br /> <br />After Allah prohibited evil in deed and tongue, He encouraged righteous, good deeds, stating that He is knowledgeable of the good that they do, and He will reward them with the best awards on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah said next&#59; <br /> <br />وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى <br /> <br />And take provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The people of Yemen used to go to <b>Hajj</b> without taking enough supplies with them. They used to say, `We are those who have <b>Tawakkul</b> (reliance on Allah).' <br /> <br />Allah revealed this Ayah&#59; <br />وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى <br /> (And take provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness)). <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah narrated that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;When people assumed <b>Ihram</b>, they would throw away whatever provisions they had and would acquire other types of provisions. Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى <br /> (And take a provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness)). <br /> <br />Allah forbade them from this practice and required them to take flour and <b>Sawiq</b> (a type of food usually eaten with dates) with them.&#34; <br /><b>The Provisions of the Hereafter</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى <br /> <br />but the best provision is <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness). <br /> <br />When Allah required mankind to supply themselves with what sustains them for the journeys of this life, He directed them to the necessary provisions for the Hereafter&#59;<b>Taqwa</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ <br />and as an adornment; and the raiment of <b>Taqwa</b>, that is better. (7&#59;26) <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the material covering and then He mentioned the spiritual covering, which includes humbleness, obedience and <b>Taqwa</b>. He also stated that the latter provision is better and more beneficial than the former. <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُونِ يَا أُوْلِي الَالْبَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So fear Me, O men of understanding! <br /> <br />meaning&#59;`Fear My torment, punishment, and affliction for those who defy Me and do not adhere to My commands, O people of reason and understanding.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 196" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-196/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">197</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>197</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 198" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-198/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=197;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
