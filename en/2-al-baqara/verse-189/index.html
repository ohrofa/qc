Say, to them&#59; `They are appointed times (mawqt is the plural of mqt) for the people, for them to know the times for sowing the land, for business, for their women's waiting periods, their fast and their breaking it, and the Pilgrimage' (wa'l-hajji and the Pilgrimage', is a supplement to li'l-nsi, `for the people'), that is to say, [appointed times] by which its season is known, for if they [the new moons] always looked the same, none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs, in [your] state of pilgrimage inviolability (ihrm), when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit, disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear, God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors, when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, and fear God, that you may prosper, [that you may] triumph.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Crescent Moons</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الاهِلَّةِ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ <br /> <br />They ask you (O Muhammad) about the crescents. Say&#59;&#34;These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi related that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The people asked Allah's Messenger about the crescent moons. Thereafter, this Ayah was revealed, so that they mark their acts of worship, the <b>Iddah</b> (the period of time a divorced woman or a widow is required to wait before remarrying) of their women and the time of their <b>Hajj</b> (pilgrimage to Makkah).&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn Umar narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />جَعَلَ اللهُ الاَْهِلَّةَ مَوَاقِيتَ لِلنَّاسِ فَصُومُوا لِرُوْيَتِهِ وَأَفْطِرُوا لِرُوْيَتِهِ فَإِنْ غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ فَعُدُّوا ثَلَثِينَ يَوْمًا <br /> <br />Allah has made the crescents signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind. Hence, fast on seeing it (the crescent for <b>Ramadan</b>) and break the fast on seeing it (the crescent for <b>Shawwal</b>). If it (the crescent) was obscure to you then count thirty days (mark that month as thirty days). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Al-Hakim in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, and he said, &#34;The chain is <b>Sahih</b>, and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not recorded it.&#34; <br /><b>Righteousness comes from Taqwa</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوْاْ الْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَى وَأْتُواْ الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا <br /> <br />It is not <b>Al-Birr</b> (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but <b>Al-Birr</b> is from <b>Taqwa</b>. So enter houses through their proper doors. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, they used to enter the house from the back upon assuming the <b>Ihram</b>. Thereafter, Allah revealed (the following Ayah&#59; <br />وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوْاْ الْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَى وَأْتُواْ الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا <br /> (It is not <b>Al-Birr</b> (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back but <b>Al-Birr</b> is from <b>Taqwa</b>. So enter houses through their proper doors).&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded the same Hadith from Al-Bara but with the wording; <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Ansar</b> used to enter their houses from the back when returning from a journey. Thereafter, this <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;189 above) was revealed...&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said, <br /> <br />&#34;When some people during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b> would leave home to travel, and then decide not to travel, they would not enter the house from its door. Rather, they would climb over the back wall. Allah the Exalted said&#59; <br />وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَنْ تَأْتُوْاْ الْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا <br /> (It is not <b>Al-Birr</b> (piety, righteousness) that you enter the houses from the back).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />and have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah that you may be successful. <br /> <br />Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, means to do what He has commanded you and refrain from what He has forbidden for you, <br /> لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ <br /> (that you may be successful), tomorrow when you stand before Him and He thus rewards you perfectly</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 188" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-188/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">189</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>189</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 190" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-190/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
