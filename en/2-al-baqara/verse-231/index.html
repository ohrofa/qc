So when her term of <b>Iddah</b> (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her <b>Iddah</b> finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لَّتَعْتَدُواْ <br />But do not take them back to hurt them, <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br />a man used to divorce his wife, and when her <b>Iddah</b> came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her <b>Iddah</b> and when her <b>Iddah</b> term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of <b>Iddah</b> would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. <br /> <br />Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said; <br /> <br /> وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ <br />and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. <br /> <br />meaning, by defying Allah's commandments. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوَاْ ايَاتِ اللّهِ هُزُوًا <br />And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest, <br />Ibn Jarir said that Abu Musa (Al-Ashari) narrated that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger once became angry at the Ashari tribe. Abu Musa went to him and said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! Are you angry with the Ash`ariyyin&#34; The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ أَحَدُكُمْ قَدْ طَلَّقْتُ قَدْ رَاجَعْتُ لَيْسَ هَذَا طَلَقُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ طَلِّقُوا الْمَرْأَةَ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهَا <br />One of you says, `I divorced her' -then says- `I took her back!' This is not the appropriate way Muslims conduct divorce. Divorce the woman when she has fulfilled the term of the prescribed period. <br /> <br />Masruq said that; <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to the man who harms his wife by divorcing her and then taking her back, so that the <b>Iddah</b> term is prolonged for her. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ata Al-Khurasani, Ar-Rabi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br />&#34;He is the man who divorces his wife and says, `I was joking.' Or he frees a servant or gets married and says, `I was only joking.' Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوَاْ ايَاتِ اللّهِ هُزُوًا <br /></b> (And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest). Then such men were made to bear the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ <br />but remember Allah's favors on you, <br /> <br />meaning, by His sending His Messenger with the right guidance and clear signs to you. <br /> <br /> وَمَا أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ <br />and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e., the Qur'an) and <b>Al-Hikmah</b>) (meaning the <b>Sunnah</b>), <br /> <br /> يَعِظُكُم بِهِ <br />whereby He instructs you. <br /> <br />meaning, commands you, forbids you and threatens you for transgressing His prohibitions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br />And fear Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, concerning what you perform and what you avoid. <br /> <br /> وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br />and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything. <br /> <br />none of your secret or public affairs ever escapes His knowledge, and He will treat you accordingly</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 230" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-230/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">231</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>231</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 232" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-232/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=231;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
