Do not hold on to them with intent to harm them and commit aggression: anyone who does this wrongs himself.

Be mindful of God and know that He has full knowledge of everything.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And when ye have divorced your women, and they have attained their period, then either retain them reputably or let them off kindly; and retain them not to their hurt that ye may trespass; and whosoever doth this assuredly wrongeth his soul.

Do not treat Allah's Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse Allah's favours on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction.

It is transgression to retain them merely for harassment; and whoever' does that indeed wrongs his own self. Do not play with Allah's Commandments, and remember that Allah has blessed you with a great favour. He admonishes you to show due respect to the Book and the Wisdom He has sent to you.

He who does so will wrong himself. Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong.

Do not take God’s Revelations for a mockery and remember God’s favor on you and what He has sent down on you of the Book and the Wisdom wherewith He exhorts you (to guidance).

Do not take Allâh´s commandments in a light way; and remember Allâh´s favour upon you and what He has revealed to you of the Book and the Wisdom, wherewith He exhorts you.

So when her term of <b>Iddah</b> (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her <b>Iddah</b> finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لَّتَعْتَدُواْ <br />But do not take them back to hurt them, <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br />a man used to divorce his wife, and when her <b>Iddah</b> came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her <b>Iddah</b> and when her <b>Iddah</b> term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of <b>Iddah</b> would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. <br /> <br />Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said; <br /> <br /> وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ <br />and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. <br /> <br />meaning, by defying Allah's commandments. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوَاْ ايَاتِ اللّهِ هُزُوًا <br />And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest, <br />Ibn Jarir said that Abu Musa (Al-Ashari) narrated that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger once became angry at the Ashari tribe. Abu Musa went to him and said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! Are you angry with the Ash`ariyyin&#34; The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ أَحَدُكُمْ قَدْ طَلَّقْتُ قَدْ رَاجَعْتُ لَيْسَ هَذَا طَلَقُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ طَلِّقُوا الْمَرْأَةَ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهَا <br />One of you says, `I divorced her' -then says- `I took her back!' This is not the appropriate way Muslims conduct divorce. Divorce the woman when she has fulfilled the term of the prescribed period. <br /> <br />Masruq said that; <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to the man who harms his wife by divorcing her and then taking her back, so that the <b>Iddah</b> term is prolonged for her. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ata Al-Khurasani, Ar-Rabi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br />&#34;He is the man who divorces his wife and says, `I was joking.' Or he frees a servant or gets married and says, `I was only joking.' Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوَاْ ايَاتِ اللّهِ هُزُوًا <br /></b> (And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest). Then such men were made to bear the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ <br />but remember Allah's favors on you, <br /> <br />meaning, by His sending His Messenger with the right guidance and clear signs to you. <br /> <br /> وَمَا أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ <br />and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e., the Qur'an) and <b>Al-Hikmah</b>) (meaning the <b>Sunnah</b>), <br /> <br /> يَعِظُكُم بِهِ <br />whereby He instructs you. <br /> <br />meaning, commands you, forbids you and threatens you for transgressing His prohibitions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br />And fear Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, concerning what you perform and what you avoid. <br /> <br /> وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br />and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything. <br /> <br />none of your secret or public affairs ever escapes His knowledge, and He will treat you accordingly</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 230" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-230/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">231</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>231</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 232" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-232/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
