Then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, they said, &#34;There is no power for us today against Goliath and his soldiers.&#34; But those who were certain that they would meet Allah said, &#34;How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah.

But they drank of it, except a few of them; and when he crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said, 'We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts.'

Anyone who drinks from it will not belong with me, but anyone who refrains from tasting it will belong with me; if he scoops up just one handful [he will be excused].’ But they all drank [deep] from it, except for a few. When he crossed it with those who had kept faith, they said, ‘We have no strength today against Goliath and his warriors.’ But those who knew that they were going to meet their Lord said, ‘How often a small force has defeated a large army with God’s permission!

But they drank thereof, save a few of them. Then when he had crossed it, he, and those who believe with him, they said: We have no strength to-day against Jalut and his hosts.

When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said&#59; &#34;This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.&#34; but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said&#59; &#34;How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one?

Afterwards when Saul, and those who had believed with him, crossed the river and advanced forward, the former said to Saul, &#34;We have no power left this day to fight against Goliath and his hosts.&#34; But those who believed that one Day they shall meet Allah, declared, &#34;lt has often been that a small host has, by Allah's grace, overcome a big host: for Allah is with those who show fortitude.&#34;</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>When Saul led his armies, he said: &#34;God will test you by a stream.

His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Talut said&#59; <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّ اللّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُم <br /> <br />بِنَهَرٍ <br /> <br />he said&#59;&#34;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. <br /> <br />meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e., the Shariah river, according to Ibn Abbas and others. <br /> <br />He continued, <br /> <br />فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي <br /> <br />So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; <br /> <br />meaning, shall not accompany me today. <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي إِلاَّ مَنِ اغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ <br /> <br />and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand. <br /> <br />meaning, there is no harm in this case. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />فَشَرِبُواْ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً مِّنْهُمْ <br /> <br />Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever took some of it (the river's water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara bin Azib said, <br /> <br />&#34;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of <b>Badr</b> were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also reported this. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ مَعَهُ قَالُواْ لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا الْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنودِهِ <br /> <br />So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said&#59;&#34;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah's promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. <br /> <br />قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَقُو اللّهِ <br /> <br />But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said&#59; <br /> <br />كَم مِّن فِيَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِيَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave&#34; And Allah is with <b>As-Sabirin</b> (the patient)</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 248" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-248/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">249</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>249</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 250" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-250/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
