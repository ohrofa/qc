In a hadth it is said, `Whoever gives respite to one in difficulty, or waives his debt, God will place him under His shade, on a day when there shall be no shade except God's', as reported by Muslim.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>And if the debtor is having a hard time, then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know. <br /> <br />Allah commands creditors to be patient with debtors who are having a hard time financially, <br />وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسَرَةٍ <br /> (And if the debtor is having a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay). <br /> <br />During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, when the debt came to term, the creditor would say to the debtor, &#34;Either pay now or interest will be added to the debt.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah encouraged creditors to give debtors respite regarding their debts and promised all that is good, and a great reward from Him for this righteous deed, <br />وَأَن تَصَدَّقُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ <br /> (But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know), <br /> <br />meaning, if you forfeit your debts and cancel them completely. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Sulayman bin Buraydah said that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard the Messenger of Allah say, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَنْظَرَ مُعْسِرًا فَلَهُ بِكُلِّ يَوْمٍ مِثْلُهُ صَدَقَة <br /> <br />Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will gain charity of equal proportions for each day he gives. <br /> <br />I also heard the Prophet say, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَنْظَرَ مُعْسِرًا فَلَهُ بِكُلِّ يَوْمٍ مِثْلُهُ صَدَقَة <br /> <br />Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will earn charity multiplied two times for each day he gives. <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I heard you say, `Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will gain charity of equal proportions for each day he gives.' <br /> <br />I also heard you say, `Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will earn charity multiplied by two times for each day he gives.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />لَهُ بِكُلِّ يَومٍ مِثْلُهُ صَدَقَةٌ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَحِلَّ الدَّيْنُ فَإِذَا حَلَّ الدَّيْنُ فَأَنْظَرَهُ فَلَهُ بِكُلِّ يَوْمٍ مِثْلَهُ صَدَقَة <br /> <br />He will earn charity of equal proportions for each day (he gives time) before the term of the debt comes to an end, and when the term comes to an end, he will again acquire charity multiplied by two times for each day if he gives more time.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that; <br /> <br />Abu Qatadah had a debt on a man, who used to hide from Abu Qatadah when he looked for him to pay what he owed him. One day, Abu Qatadah came looking for the debtor and a young boy came out, and he asked him about the debtor and found out that he was in the house eating. <br /> <br />Abu Qatadah said in a loud voice, &#34;O Fellow! Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.&#34; <br /> <br />The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, &#34;Why are you hiding from me?&#34; <br /> <br />The man said, &#34;I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Qatadah said, &#34;By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Qatadah cried and said, &#34;I heard the Messenger of Allah say, <br /> <br />مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, &#34;What deeds did you perform for Me in your life?&#34; <br /> <br />فَقَالَ مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ اخِرِهَا يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ وَكُنْتُ رَجُلً أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ <br /> <br />He will say, &#34;O Lord! In my life, I have not performed a deed for Your sake that equals an atom,&#34; three times. <br /> <br />The third time, the servant will add, &#34;O Lord! You granted me wealth and I used to be a merchant. I used to be lenient, giving easy terms to those well-off and giving time to the debtors who faced hard times.&#34; <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة <br /> <br />Allah will say, &#34;I Am the Most Worthy of giving easy terms. Therefore, enter Paradise.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah also recorded this <b>Hadith</b> from Hudhayfah, and Muslim recorded a similar wording from Uqbah bin Amir and Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri. <br /> <br />Allah further advised His servants, by reminding them that this life will soon end and all the wealth in it will vanish. He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. <br /> <br />Allah also warned them against His torment, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 279" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-279/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">280</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>280</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 281" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-281/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
