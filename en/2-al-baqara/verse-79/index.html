How could you ask the People of the Book about anything, while the Book of Allah (Qur'an) that He revealed to His Prophet is the most recent Book from Him and you still read it fresh and young Allah told you that the People of the Book altered the Book of Allah, changed it and wrote another book with their own hands. <br /> <br />They then said, `This book is from Allah,' so that they acquired a small profit by it. Hasn't the knowledge that came to you prohibited you from asking them By Allah! We have not seen any of them asking you about what was revealed to you.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, <br /> <br />&#34;The little amount here means this life and all that it contains.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby. <br /> <br />means, &#34;Woe to them because of what they have written with their own hands, the lies, falsehood and alterations. Woe to them because of the property that they unjustly acquired.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas commented, <br />فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم <br /> (Woe to them), <br /> <br />&#34;Means the torment will be theirs because of the lies that they wrote with their own hands, <br />وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ <br /> (And woe to them for that they earn thereby), which they unjustly acquired from people, be they commoners or otherwise.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 78" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-78/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">79</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>79</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 80" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-80/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=79;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
