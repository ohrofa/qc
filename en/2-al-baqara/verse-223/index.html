The Jews claimed that those who have sex with their women from behind would have offspring with crossed-eyes. When the <b>Muhajirun</b> came to Al-Madinah, they married <b>Ansar</b> women and had sex with them from behind. One of these women would not obey her husband and said, `You will not do that until I go to Allah's Messenger (and ask him about this matter).' <br /> <br />She went to Umm Salamah and told her the story. <br /> <br />Umm Salamah said, `Wait until Allah's Messenger comes.' When Allah's Messenger came, the <b>Ansari</b> woman was shy to ask him about this matter, so she left. <br /> <br />Umm Salamah told Allah's Messenger the story and he said&#59; <br /> <br />Summon the Ansari woman. <br /> <br />She was summoned and he recited this Ayah to her&#59; <br /> <br />نِسَأوُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّى شِيْتُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will. <br /> <br />He added&#59; <br /> <br />صِمَامًا وَاحِدًا <br /> <br />Only in one valve (the vagina).&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by At-Tirmidhi who said, &#34;<b>Hasan</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i reported that Ka`b bin Alqamah said that Abu An-Nadr said that; <br /> <br />he asked Nafi, &#34;The people are repeating the statement that you relate from Ibn Umar that he allowed sex with women in their rear (anus).&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;They have said a lie about me. But let me tell you what really happened. <br /> <br />Ibn Umar was once reciting the Qur'an while I was with him and he reached the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />نِسَأوُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّى شِيْتُمْ <br /> (Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will), he then said, `O Nafi`! Do you know the story behind this <b>Ayah</b>?' <br /> <br />I said, `No.' <br /> <br />He said, `We, the people of Quraysh, used to have sexual intercourse with our wives from the back (in the vagina). When we migrated to Al-Madinah and married some <b>Ansari</b> women, we wanted to do the same with them. They disliked it and made a big issue out of it. The Ansari women had followed the practice of the Jews who have sex with their women while they lay on their sides. Then, Allah revealed&#59; <br />نِسَأوُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّى شِيْتُمْ <br /> (Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will).&#34; <br /> <br />This has an authentic chain of narrators. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Khatami narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَسْتَحْيِي اللهُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ ثَلَاثًا لَاا تَأْتُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي أَعْجَازِهِن <br /> <br />Allah does not shy from the truth - he said it thrice-, do not have anal sex with women. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />Abu Isa At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i reported that Ibn Abbas narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَنْظُرُ اللهُ إِلى رَجُلٍ أَتَى رَجُلًا أَوِ امْرَأَةً فِي الدُّبُر <br /> <br />Allah does not look at a man who had anal sex with another man or a woman. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also the narration that Ibn Hibban collected in his <b>Sahih</b>, while Ibn Hazm stated that this is an authentic <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that Ali bin Talaq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger forbade anal sex with women, for Allah does not shy away from truth.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Isa At-Tirmidhi also reported this <b>Hadith</b> and said, &#34;<b>Hasan</b>&#34;. <br /> <br />Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Abdur-Rahman Darimi reported in his <b>Musnad</b> that; <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Yasar Abu Hubab said&#59;I said to Ibn Umar, &#34;What do you say about having sex with women in the rear?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;What does it mean?&#34; <br /> <br />I said, &#34;Anal sex.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Does a Muslim do that?&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has an authentic chain of narrators and is an explicit rejection of anal sex from Ibn Umar. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr bin Ziyad Naysaburi reported that Ismail bin Ruh said that; <br /> <br />he asked Malik bin Anas, &#34;What do you say about having sex with women in the anus?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;You are not an Arab. Does sex occur but in the place of pregnancy? Do it only in the Farj (vagina).&#34; <br /> <br />I said, &#34;O Abu Abdullah! They say that you allow that practice.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;They utter a lie about me, they lie about me.&#34; <br /> <br />This is Malik's firm stance on this subject. <br /> <br />It is also the view of Sa`id bin Musayyib, Abu Salamah, Ikrimah, Tawus, Ata, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Mujahid bin Jabr, Al-Hasan and other scholars of the <b>Salaf</b> (the Companions and the following two generations after them). <br /> <br />They all, along with the majority of the scholars, harshly rebuked the practice of anal sex and many of them called this practice a <b>Kufr</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَدِّمُواْ لَانفُسِكُمْ <br />and send for your own selves beforehand. <br /> <br />meaning, by performing the acts of worship while refraining from whatever Allah has prohibited for you. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said afterwards&#59; <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّكُم مُّلَقُوهُ <br /> <br />And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), <br /> <br />meaning, He will hold you accountable for all of your deeds. <br /> <br />وَبَشِّرِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad). <br /> <br />meaning, those who obey what Allah has commanded and refrain from what He has prohibited. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Ata said, or related it to Ibn Abbas, <br />وَقَدِّمُواْ لَانفُسِكُمْ <br /> (...and send for your own selves beforehand) means, <br /> <br />mention Allah's Name, by saying, <b>`Bismillah</b>', before having sexual intercourse.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also reported that Ibn Abbas narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَهْلَهُ قَالَ بِاسْمِ اللهِ اللَّهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا فَإنَّهُ إِنْ يُقَدَّرْ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَدٌ فِي ذلِكَ لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَبَدًا <br /> <br />If anyone of you on having sexual relations with his wife said&#59;`In the Name of Allah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you bestow upon us (i.e., the coming offspring) from Satan,' and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 222" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-222/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">223</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>223</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 224" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-224/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
