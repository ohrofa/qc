When the fire was lit, and illuminated the surrounding area, the person benefited from it and felt safe. Then the fire was suddenly extinguished. Therefore, total darkness covered this person, and he became unable to see anything or find his way out of it. <br /> <br />Further, this person could not hear or speak and became so blind that even if there were light, he would not be able to see. This is why he cannot return to the state that he was in before this happened to him. Such is the case with the hypocrites who preferred misguidance over guidance, deviation over righteousness. This parable indicates that the hypocrites first believed, then disbelieved, just as Allah stated in other parts of the Qur'an. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَهَبَ اللّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ <br /> <br />Allah removed their light, <br /> <br />means, Allah removed what benefits them, and this is the light, and He left them with what harms them, that is, the darkness and smoke. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ <br /> <br />And left them in darkness, <br /> <br />that is their doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy. <br /> <br />لااَّ يُبْصِرُونَ <br /> <br />(So) they could not see. <br /> <br />meaning, they are unable to find the correct path or find its direction. <br /> <br />In addition, they are, <br /> <br />صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 16" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-16/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">17</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>17</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 18" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=17;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
