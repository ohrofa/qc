Yet, they entered the door on their behinds, distorting the words. They said; <b>`Habbah</b> (seed), in <b>Sha`rah</b> (a hair).' <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i recorded this part of it from Abu Hurayrah only, but he has a chain from the Prophet, explaining Allah's statement, <br />حِطَّةٌ <br /> (<b>Hittah</b>), <br /> <br />saying, &#34;So they deviated and said <b>`Habbah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was recorded by Abdur-Razzaq, and his route was also collected by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />Muslim and At-Tirmidhi narrated similar versions of this <b>Hadith</b>, At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />The summary of what the scholars have said about this subject is that the Children of Israel distorted Allah's command to them to submit to Him in tongue and deed. They were commanded to enter the city while bowing down, but they entered while sliding on their rear ends and raising their heads! They were commanded to say, <b>`Hittah</b>' meaning, &#34;Relieve us from our errors and sins.&#34; However, they mocked this command and said, &#34;<b>Hintah</b> (grain seed) in <b>Sha`irah</b> (barley).&#34; This demonstrates the worst type of rebellion and disobedience, and it is why Allah released His anger and punishment upon them, all because of their sinning and defying His commands. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزاً مِّنَ السَّمَاء بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So We sent upon the wrongdoers <b>Rijz</b> (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebellion. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Every word in Allah's Book that says <b>Rijz</b> means, `a punishment.&#34;' <br /> <br />Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan and Qatadah were reported to have said that; <br /><b>Rijz</b> means `Torment.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Sa`d bin Malik, Usamah bin Zayd and Khuzaymah bin Thabit said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الطَّاعُونُ رِجْزٌ عَذَابٌ عُذِّبَ بِهِ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُم <br /> <br />The plague is a <b>Rijz</b>, a punishment with which Allah punished those before you. <br /> <br />This is also how An-Nasa'i recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. In addition, the basis of this <b>Hadith</b> was collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, <br /> <br />إِذَا سَمِعْتُمُ الطَّاعُونَ بأَرْضٍ فَلَ تَدْخُلُوهَا <br /> <br />If you hear of the plague in a land, then do not enter it. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded Usamah bin Zayd saying that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إنَّ هَذَا الْوَجَعَ وَالسَّقَمَ رِجْزٌ عُذِّبَ بِهِ بَعْضُ الاُْمَمِ قَبْلَكُم <br /> <br />This calamity and sickness (i.e. the plague) is a <b>Rijz</b>, a punishment with which some nations who were before you were punished. <br /> <br />The basis of this <b>Hadith</b> was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 58" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 60" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
