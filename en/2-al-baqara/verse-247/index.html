God gives the kingship to whom He will, in the way He does, and there can be no objection; and God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, of those who deserve it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah tells; <br /> <br />وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا <br /> <br />And their Prophet said to them, &#34;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why; <br /> <br />قَالُوَاْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا <br /> <br />They said, &#34;How can he be a king over us, <br /> <br />meaning, how can he be the king for us! <br /> <br />وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُوْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ الْمَالِ <br /> <br />when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth, <br /> <br />They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. <br /> <br />Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. <br /> <br />The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him. <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّ اللّهَ اصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />He (their Prophet) said&#59;&#34;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you. <br /> <br />meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.' <br /> <br />Their Prophet stated, &#34;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#34; <br /> <br />Further&#59; <br /> <br />وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ <br />and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. <br /> <br />meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. <br /> <br />In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. <br /> <br />The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.' <br /> <br />He then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُوْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). <br /> <br />This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower. <br /> <br />meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. <br /> <br />He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 246" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-246/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">247</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>247</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 248" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-248/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
