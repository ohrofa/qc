He then agreed to a peace treaty with the idolators and said to them, (No one before has ever prevented people from entering the House. One would even see the killer of his father and brother, but would not prevent him (from entering the House of Allah). They said, &#34;Whoever killed our fathers at <b>Badr</b>, shall never enter it while there is one of us alive.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />وَسَعَى فِي خَرَابِهَا <br /> (and strive for their ruin) means, <br /> <br />those who prevent whoever maintain the <b>Masjids</b> with Allah's remembrance and who visit Allah's House to perform <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the Quraysh prevented the Prophet from praying at the <b>Ka`bah</b> in <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, so Allah revealed, <br />وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن مَّنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ اللّهِ أَن يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ <br /> (And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allah's Name be mentioned (i.e. prayers and invocations) in Allah's <b>Masjids</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />After Allah chastised the Jews and Christians, He also criticized the idolators who expelled the Messenger of Allah and his Companions from Makkah, preventing them from praying in <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, which they kept exclusively for their idols and polytheism. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا لَهُمْ أَلاَّ يُعَذِّبَهُمُ اللَّهُ وَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَأءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَأوُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br />And why should not Allah punish them while they hinder (men) from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, and they are not its guardians! None can be its guardians except <b>Al-Muttaqun</b> (the pious), but most of them know not. (8&#59;34) <br /> <br />مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُواْ مَسَاجِدَ الله شَـهِدِينَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِم بِالْكُفْرِ أُوْلَـيِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ وَفِى النَّارِ هُمْ خَـلِدُونَ <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَـجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءاتَى الزَّكَوةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ فَعَسَى أُوْلَـيِكَ أَن يَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْتَدِينَ <br /> <br />It is not for the <b>Mushrikin</b> (polytheists), to maintain the <b>Masjids</b> of Allah while they witness against their own selves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide. <br /> <br />The <b>Masjids</b> of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day; perform the <b>Salah</b>, and give the <b>Zakah</b> and fear none but Allah. It is they who are on true guidance. (9&#59;17-18) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />هُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْهَدْىَ مَعْكُوفاً أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّوْمِنُونَ وَنِسَأءٌ مُّوْمِنَـتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَيُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكمْ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَأءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُواْ لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً <br /> <br />They are the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from <b>Al-Masjid-Al-Haram</b> (at Makkah) and detained the sacrificial animals, from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills ـ if they (the believers and the disbelievers) had been apart, We verily, would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment. (48&#59;25) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah said here, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَـجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءاتَى الزَّكَوةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />The <b>Masjids</b> of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day; perform the <b>Salah</b>, and give the <b>Zakah</b> and fear none but Allah. (9&#59;18) <br /> <br />Therefore, if those believers who follow the virtues mentioned in the Ayah were prevented from attending the <b>Masjid</b>, then what cause for destruction is worse than this Maintaining the <b>Masjids</b> not only means beautifying them, but it involves remembering Allah, establishing His <b>Shariah</b> in the <b>Masjids</b> and purifying them from the filth of <b>Shirk</b>. <br /><b>The Good News that Islam shall prevail</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَا إِلاَّ خَأيِفِينَ <br /> <br />It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah's <b>Masjids</b>) except in fear. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, &#34;Do not allow them - the disbelievers - to enter the <b>Masjids</b>, except to satisfy the terms of an armistice or a treaty.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah in 9 H, he commanded that someone announce at Mina, <br /> <br />&#34;After the current year, no idolators shall perform <b>Hajj</b>, and no naked persons shall perform <b>Tawaf</b> around the House, except for those who have a treaty. In this case, the treaty will be carried to the end of its term.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> supports the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ فَلأَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا <br /> <br />O you who believe! (in Allah's Oneness and in His Messenger Muhammad)! Verily, the <b>Mushrikun</b> (idolators) are <b>Najasun</b> (impure). So let them not come near <b>Al-Masjid-Al-Haram</b> (at Makkah) after this year. (9&#59;28) <br /> <br />It was also said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;114) carries the good news for the Muslims from Allah that He will allow them to take over <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> and all the <b>Masjids</b> and disgrace the idolators. Soon after, the <b>Ayah</b> indicated, no idolator shall enter the House, except out of fear of being seized or killed, unless he embraces Islam. Allah fulfilled this promise and later decreed that idolators not be allowed to enter <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah stated that no two religions should remain in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Jews and Christians should be expelled from it, all praise is due to Allah. <br /> <br />All of these rulings ensure maintaining the honor of <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> and purifying the area where Allah sent His Messenger to warn and bring good news to all of mankind, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> also described the disgrace that the disbelievers earn in this life, and that the punishment comes in a form comparable to the deed. Just as they prevented the believers from entering <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, they were prevented from entering it in turn. Just as they expelled the believers from Makkah, they were in turn expelled from Makkah, <br />. <br />لهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ <br /> <br />For them there is disgrace in this world, <br /> <br />وَلَهُمْ فِي الاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />because they breached the sanctity of the House and brought filth to it by erecting idols all around it, invoking other than Allah and performing <b>Tawaf</b> around it while naked, etc. <br /> <br />Here it is worth mentioning the <b>Hadith</b> about seeking refuge from disgrace in this life and the torment of the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Busr bin Artah said that the Messenger of Allah used to supplicate, <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ أَحْسِنْ عَاقِبَتَنَا فِي الاُْمُورِ كُلِّهَا وَأَجِرْنَا مِنْ خِزْيِ الدُّنْيَا وَعَذَابِ الاْخِرَة <br /> <br />O Allah! Make our end better in all affairs, and save us from disgrace in this life and the torment of the Hereafter. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 113" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">114</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>114</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 115" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-115/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=114;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
