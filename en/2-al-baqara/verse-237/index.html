And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J.

Forget not to be bountiful one towards another. Surely God sees the things you do.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>If you divorce wives before consummating the marriage but after fixing a bride-gift for them, then give them half of what you had previously fixed, unless they waive [their right], or unless the one who holds the marriage tie waives [his right]. Waiving [your right] is nearer to godliness, so do not forget to be generous towards one another: God sees what you do.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And if ye divorce them ere ye have touched them but have settled unto them a settlement, then due from you is half of that which ye have settled unless the wives forego, or he in whose hand is the wedding-knot foregoeth, and that ye should forego is nigher unto piety. And forget not grace amongst yourself; verily of that which ye work Allah is the Beholder.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness.

For Allah sees well all that ye do.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>In case you fixed a dower for them and then divorced them before you touched them, you should pay half of the fixed dower. But there is no harm if the woman agrees to forego it or the man, in whose hands is the marriage tie, is generous enough (to pay the dower in full). And if you (men) act generously, it is akin to piety. Do not forget to show generosity in your dealings with one another for Allah sees what you do.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount.

If it was discussing any other type of gift, then it would have been mentioned that way, especially when this <b>Ayah</b> follows the previous <b>Ayah</b> related to this subject. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Giving away half of the bridal-money in this case is the agreed practice according to the scholars. So, the husband pays half of the appointed <b>Mahr</b> if he divorces his wife before consummating the marriage. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> إَلاَّ أَن يَعْفُونَ <br /> <br />unless they (the women) agree to remit it, <br /> <br />meaning, the wife forfeits the dowry and relieves the husband from further financial responsibility. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that Abu Salih mentioned that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Unless the wife forfeits her right.&#34; <br /> <br />Furthermore, Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abu Hatim said that it was reported that Shurayh, Sa`id bin Musayyib, Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Nafi, Qatadah, Jabir bin Zayd, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ibn Sirin, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and As-Suddi said similarly. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> أَوْ يَعْفُوَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ النِّكَاحِ <br />or he (the husband), in whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to remit it. <br />Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his grandfather narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلِيُّ عُقْدَةِ النِّكَاحِ الزَّوْج <br />The husband is he who has the marriage tie. <br />Ibn Marduwyah also reported this <b>Hadith</b>, and it is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. <br />The <b>Hadith</b> states that the husband is the person who really holds the marriage tie in his hand, as it is up to him to go on with the marriage or end it. On the other hand, the <b>Wali</b> of the wife is not allowed to give away any of her rightful dues without her permission, especially the dowry. <br /> <br />Allah then stated&#59; <br /> <br /> وَأَن تَعْفُواْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى <br />And to remit it is nearer to <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness). <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some scholars said that this statement is directed at both men and women.&#34; <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /><b> <br />وَأَن تَعْفُواْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى <br /></b> &#34;(And to remit it is nearer to <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety, righteousness)), <br /> <br />indicates that the one who forgives, is nearer to <b>At-Taqwa</b> (piety).&#34; <br />A similar statement was made by Ash-Sha`bi and several other scholars. <br /> <br />Mujahid, An-Nakhai, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Thawri stated that; <br /> <br />`liberality' mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> refers to the woman giving away her half <b>Mahr</b>, or the man giving away the full <b>Mahr</b>. This is why Allah said here&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا تَنسَوُاْ الْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ <br />And do not forget liberality between yourselves. <br /> <br />meaning, kindness (or generosity), as Sa`id has stated. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> إِنَّ اللّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do. <br /> <br />meaning, none of your affairs ever escapes His perfect Watch, and He will reward each according to his deeds</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 236" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-236/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">237</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>237</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 238" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-238/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=237;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
