Allah commanded them to worship Him and to associate none with Him in worship, just as He has commanded all of His creatures, for this is why Allah created them. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ <br /> <br />And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying)&#59;<b>La ilaha illa Ana</b> (none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)), so worship Me (alone and none else). (21&#59;25) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ <br /> <br />And verily, We have sent among every <b>Ummah</b> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming)&#59;&#34;Worship Allah (alone), and avoid the <b>Taghut</b> (all false deities). (16&#59;36) <br /> <br />This is the highest and most important right, that is, Allah's right that He be worshipped alone without partners. <br /> <br />After that comes the right of the creatures, foremost, the right of the parents. Allah usually mentions the rights of the parents along with His rights. For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ <br /> <br />Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. (31&#59;14) <br /> <br />Also, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً <br /> <br />And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents, (17&#59;23), until, <br /> <br />وَءَاتِ ذَا الْقُرْبَى حَقَّهُ وَالْمِسْكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ <br /> <br />And give to the kinsman his due and to the <b>Miskin</b> (poor) and to the wayfarer. (17&#59;26) <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> record that Ibn Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah! What is the best deed?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />الصَّلَةُ عَلى وَقْتِهَا <br /> <br />`Performing the prayer on time.' <br /> <br />I said, 'Then what?' He said, <br /> <br />بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن <br /> <br />`Being kind to one's parents.' <br /> <br />I said, `Then what?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله <br /><b>`Jihad</b> in the cause of Allah.' <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَالْيَتَامَى <br /> <br />and to orphans, <br /> <br />meaning, the young who have no fathers to fend for them. <br /> <br />وَالْمَسَاكِينِ <br /> <br />and <b>Al-Masakin</b> (the poor), <br /> <br />plural for <b>Miskin</b>, the one who does not find what he needs to spend on himself and his family. <br /> <br />We will discuss these categories when we explain the <b>Ayah</b> of Surah <b>An-Nisa</b> where Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْياً وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً <br /> <br />Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents. (4&#59;36) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَقُولُواْ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْناً <br /> <br />and speak good to people, <br /> <br />meaning, say good words to them and be lenient with them, this includes commanding good and forbidding evil. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />`The good saying' means commanding good and forbidding evil, and being patient and forgiving. <br /> <br />The `good words to people', as Allah commanded, also includes every good type of behavior that Allah is pleased with.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad narrated that Abu Dharr said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَحْقِرَنَّ مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ شَيْيًا وَإِنْ لَمْ تَجِدْ فَالْقَ أَخَاكَ بِوَجْهٍ مُنْطَلِق <br /> <br />Do not belittle any form of righteousness, and even if you did not find any good deed except meeting your brother with a smiling face, then do so. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Muslim in his <b>Sahih</b> and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Allah commands the servants to say good words to people, after He commanded them to be kind to them, thereby mentioning two categories of manners&#59;good speech and good actions. <br /> <br />He then emphasized the command to worship Him and the command to do good, ordaining the prayer and the <b>Zakah</b>, <br /> <br />وَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلَةَ وَاتُواْ الزَّكَاةَ <br /> <br />and perform <b>As-Salah</b> and give <b>Zakah</b>. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً مِّنكُمْ وَأَنتُم مِّعْرِضُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders. <br /> <br />Allah informed us that the People of the Book, except for a few among them, ignored these orders, that is, they knowingly and intentionally abandoned them. <br /> <br />Allah ordered this <b>Ummah</b> similarly in Surah <b>An-Nisa</b> when He said, <br /> <br />وَاعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْياً وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً وَبِذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْيَتَـمَى وَالْمَسَـكِينِ وَالْجَارِ ذِى الْقُرْبَى وَالْجَارِ الْجُنُبِ وَالصَّـحِبِ بِالجَنْبِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً <br /> <br />Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, <b>Al-Masakin</b> (the poor), the neighbor who is near of kin, the neighbor who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (servants) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allah does not like such as are proud and boastful. (4&#59;36). <br /> <br />Of these orders, this <b>Ummah</b> has practiced what no other nation before it has, and all praise is due to Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 82" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 84" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
