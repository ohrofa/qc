Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment. (10&#59;96-97) <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here&#59; <br />وَلَيِنْ أَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ أُوْتُواْ الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ ايَةٍ مَّا تَبِعُواْ قِبْلَتَكَ <br /> (And even if you were to bring to the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the <b>Ayat</b> (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your <b>Qiblah</b> (prayer direction)). <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا أَنتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ <br />nor are you going to follow their <b>Qiblah</b>, <br /> <br />indicates the vigor with which Allah's Messenger implements what Allah commanded him. <br /> <br />Allah's statement also indicates that as much as the Jews adhere to their opinions and desires, the Prophet adheres by Allah's commands, obeying Him and following what pleases Him, and that he would never adhere to their desires in any case. <br /> <br />Hence, praying towards <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> was not because it was the <b>Qiblah</b> of the Jews, but because Allah had commanded it. <br /> <br />وَمَا بَعْضُهُم بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />And they will not follow each other's <b>Qiblah</b>. <br /> <br />Allah then warns those who knowingly defy the truth, because the proof against those who know is stronger than against other people. This is why Allah said to His Messenger and his <b>Ummah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَيِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءهُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 144" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-144/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">145</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>145</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 146" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-146/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
