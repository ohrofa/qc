(4&#59;150-151) <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari narrated that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The People of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and translate it into Arabic for the Muslims. The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تُصَدِّقُوا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ وَلَاا تُكَذِّبُوهُمْ وقُولُوا امَنَّا بِاللهِ وَمَا أُنْزل إِلَيْنَا <br /> <br />Do not believe the People of the Book, nor reject what they say. Rather, say, `We believe in Allah and in what was sent down to us.&#34; <br /> <br />Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Mostly, the Messenger of Allah used to recite, <br />امَنَّا بِاللّهِ وَمَأ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا <br /> (We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us) (2&#59;136), and, <b> <br />امَنَّا بِاللّهِ وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ <br /></b> (We believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allah) (3&#59;52) during the two (voluntary) <b>Rak`ah</b> before <b>Fajr</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah, Ar-Rabi and Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Asbat</b> are the twelve sons of Jacob, and each one of them had an <b>Ummah</b> of people from his descendants. This is why they were called <b>Al-Asbat</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Khalil bin Ahmad and others said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Asbat</b> among the Children of Israel are just like the tribes among the Children of Ismail.&#34; <br /> <br />This means that the <b>Asbat</b> are the various tribes of the Children of Israel, among whom Allah sent several Prophets. Moses said to the Children of Israel, <br /> <br />اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَعَلَ فِيكُمْ أَنْبِيَأءَ وَجَعَلَكُمْ مُّلُوكاً <br /> <br />Remember the favor of Allah to you&#59;when He made Prophets among you, made you kings. (5&#59;20) <br /> <br />Also, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقَطَّعْنَـهُمُ اثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا <br /> <br />And We divided them into twelve tribes. (7&#59;160) <br /> <br />Al-Qurtubi said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Sibt</b> is the group of people or a tribe all belonging to the same ancestors.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah commanded the believers to believe in Him and in all His Books and Messengers.&#34; <br /> <br />Also, Sulayman bin Habib said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were commanded to believe in the (original) Torah and <b>Injil</b>, but not to implement them.</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 135" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-135/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">136</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>136</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 137" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-137/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=136;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
