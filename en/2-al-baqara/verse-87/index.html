And the rabbis and the priests (too judged for the Jews by the <b>Tawrah</b> after those Prophets), for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto. (5&#59;44) <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br />وَقَفَّيْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ <br /> (And <b>Qaffayna</b> him with Messengers). <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that Abu Malik said that; <br /><b>Qaffayna</b> means, &#34;Succeeded&#34;, <br /> <br />while others said, &#34;Followed&#34;. <br /> <br />Both meanings are plausible, since Allah said, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى <br /> <br />Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. (23&#59;44) <br /> <br />وَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ <br /> <br />And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs and supported him with <b>Ruh-il-Qudus</b>. <br /> <br />Thereafter, <b>Allah</b> sent the last Prophet among the Children of Israel, `Isa the son of Mary, who was sent with some laws that differed with some in the <b>Tawrah</b>. <br /> <br />This is why Allah also sent miracles to support `Isa. These included; <br /> <br />bringing the dead back to life, <br /> <br />forming the shape of birds from clay and blowing into them, after which they became living birds by Allah's leave, <br /> <br />healing the sick and foretelling the Unseen, as Ibn Abbas stated. <br /> <br />Allah also aided him with <b>Ruh Al-Qudus</b>, and that refers to Jibril. <br /> <br />All of these signs testified to the truthfulness of `Isa and what he was sent with. Yet, the Children of Israel became more defiant and envious of him and did not want to differ with even one part of the <b>Tawrah</b>, as Allah said about `Isa, <br /> <br />وَلاٌّحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَجِيْتُكُمْ بِأَيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. (3&#59;50) <br /> <br />Hence, the Children of Israel treated the Prophets in the worst manner, rejecting some of them and killing some of them. <br /> <br />All of this occurred because the Prophets used to command the Jews with what differed from their desires and opinions. The Prophets also upheld the rulings of the <b>Tawrah</b> that the Jews had changed, and this is why it was difficult for them to believe in these Prophets. Therefore, they rejected the Prophets and killed some of them. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br /> أَفَكُلَّمَا جَاءكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لاأَ تَهْوَى أَنفُسُكُمُ اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ <br /> <br />Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant! <br /><b>Jibril is Ruh Al-Qudus</b> <br /> <br />The proof that Jibril is the <b>Ruh Al-Qudus</b> is the statement of Ibn Mas`ud in explanation of this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />This is also the view of Ibn Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ismail bin Khalid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Additionally, Allah said, <br /> <br />نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ <br /> <br />عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ <br /> <br />Which the trustworthy <b>Ruh</b> (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners. (26&#59;193-194) <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded Aishah saying that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah erected a Minbar in the <b>Masjid</b> on which Hassan bin Thabit (the renowned poet) used to defend the Messenger of Allah (with his poems). <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ أَيِّدْ حَسَّانَ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ كَمَا نَافَحَ عَنْ نَبِيِّك <br /> <br />O Allah! Aid Hassan with <b>Ruh Al-Qudus</b>, for he defended Your Prophet. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Sunan</b> as did At-Tirmidhi who graded it <b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Further, Ibn Hibban recorded in his <b>Sahih</b> that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ رُوحَ الْقُدُسِ نَفَثَ فِي رُوعِي أَنَّهُ لَنْ تَمُوتَ نَفْسٌ حَتَّى تَسْتَكْمِلَ رِزْقَهَا وَأَجَلَهَا فَاتَّقُوا اللهَ وَأَجْمِلُوا فِي الطَّلَب <br /><b>Ruh Al-Qudus</b> informed me that no soul shall die until it finishes its set provisions and term limit. Therefore, have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah and seek your sustenance in the most suitable way. <br /><b>The Jews tried to kill the Prophet</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَفَرِيقاً كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقاً تَقْتُلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Some you disbelieved and some you kill. <br /> <br />Az-Zamakhshari commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah did not say `killed' here, because the Jews would still try to kill the Prophet in the future, using poison and magic.&#34; <br /> <br />During the illness that preceded his death, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا زَالَتْ أَكْلَةُ خَيْبَرَ تُعَاوِدُنِي فَهذَا أَوَانُ انْقِطَاعِ أَبْهَرِي <br /> <br />I kept feeling the effect of what I ate (from the poisoned sheep) during the day of Khyber, until now, when it is the time that the aorta will be cut off (meaning when death is near). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected by Al-Bukhari and other</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 86" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-86/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">87</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>87</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 88" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-88/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
