cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, conspiring against them in sin and enmity; and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was forbidden you. What, do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What shall be the recompense of those of you who do that, but degradation in the present life, and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned unto the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of the things you do.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Yet here you are, killing one another and driving some of your own people from their homes, helping one another in sin and aggression against them. If they come to you as captives, you still pay to set them free, although you had no right to drive them out. So do you believe in some parts of the Scripture and not in others? The punishment for those of you who do this will be nothing but disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be condemned to the harshest torment: God is not unaware of what you do.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Thereafter it is ye the very ones who slay each other and drive a party of you from their homes, and back up against them with guilt and iniquity; and if they come unto you as captives, ye ransom them, whereas forbidden unto you was their driving away itself. Believe ye then in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? What, then, is to be the meed of those of you who do that, save humiliation in the life of the world? And on the Day of Judgement they shall be brought back to the severest torment, and Allah is not neglectful of that which ye work.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>But inspite of this, you are killing your brethren and driving them out from their homes and making unjust and aggressive alliances against one another. And when they come to you as captives, you trade on their ransoms whereas their expulsion itself was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in one part of the Scriptures and disbelieve in the other? What other punishment do such people from among you deserve except an ignominious life in this world and the most grievous doom on the Day of Resurrection? Allah is not unaware of what you are doing.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>Then it is you who began slaying each other and you drive out a group of your people from their homeland – providing support against them (to their opponents) through sin and injustice; and if they come to you as captives you redeem them, whereas their expulsion itself is forbidden to you; so do you believe in some of Allah’s commands and disbelieve in some? So what is the reward of those who do so, except disgrace in this world? And on the Day of Resurrection they will be assigned to the most grievous punishment; and Allah is not unaware of your deeds.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>Then there you were, killing your folks and expelling a part of your folks from their homes, backing one another against them in sin and aggression! And if they came to you as captives, you would ransom them, though their expulsion itself was forbidden you. What! Do you believe in part of the Book and deny another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Then, here you are, killing one another, and expelling a party of your own from their habitations, conspiring against them in iniquity and enmity. If you take them as captives, you hold them to ransom, and if they are brought to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was made religiously forbidden to you. Then (like a people having no sense) do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What else, then, could be the recompense of those of you who act thus than disgrace in the life of this world? On the Day of Resurrection, they will be consigned to the severest of punishment. God is not unaware and unmindful of what you do.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Yet, you are the very people who (violating the terms of the covenant) slay your own people and expel a from among you from their homes, backing up one another against them sinfully and transgressingly. And if they come to you as captives (seeking your help), you ransom them, while their very expulsion was forbidden to you. Do you believe only in a part of the Script (- covenant) while a part you deny? What is the recompense of those among you (who act like that) except disgrace in this life? And on the Day of Resurrection they shall be given over to the severest chastisement.

Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws, and the Nadr with the Khazraj, but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally, thus destroying each other's homes and expelling one another, taking prisoners and then ransoming them. When they were asked&#59; `Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?', they would reply, `Because we have been commanded to ransom'; and they would be asked, `So, why do you fight them then?', to which they would say, `For fear that our allies be humiliated'; God, exalted, says&#59; What, do you believe in part of the Book, that is, the part about ransom, and disbelieve in part?, namely, the part about renouncing fighting, expulsion and assistance [against one another]; What shall be the requital of those of you who do that, but degradation, disgrace and ignominy, in the life of this world&#59; they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nadr were expelled to Syria, and ordered to pay the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of what you do (ta`malna, or read ya`malna, `they do').</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ هَـوُلاء تَقْتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقاً مِّنكُم مِّن دِيَارِهِمْ <br /> <br />تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِالاِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِن يَأتُوكُمْ أُسَارَى تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah mentioned what they were doing, and that in the <b>Tawrah</b> He had prohibited them from shedding each other's blood, and required them to free their prisoners. <br /> <br />Now they were divided into two camps in Al-Madinah, Banu Qaynuqa, who were the allies of the Khazraj, and An-Nadir and Qurayzah, who were the allies of the Aws. When fighting erupted between Aws and Khazraj, Banu Qaynuqa would fight along with the Khazraj, while Banu An-Nadir and Qurayzah would fight along with the Aws. <br /> <br />Each Jewish camp would fight against their Jewish brethren from the other camp. They would shed each other's blood, although they had the <b>Tawrah</b> with them, and they knew their rights and dues. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Aws and Khazraj were polytheists who worshipped idols. They did not know about Paradise, the Fire, Resurrection, Divine Books the lawful and prohibited. When the war would end, the Jews would ransom their prisoners and implement the <b>Tawrah</b>. Consequently, Banu Qaynuqa would ransom their prisoners who were captured by the Aws, while Banu An-Nadir and Qurayzah would ransom their prisoners who were captured by the Khazraj. They would also ask for blood money. <br /> <br />During these wars, they would kill whomever (Jews or Arabs) they could, while helping the polytheists against their brethren. Therefore, Allah reminded them of this when He said, <br /> <br />أَفَتُوْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ <br /> .. <br /> <br />Then do you believe in a part of the Book and reject the rest! <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, `Do you ransom them according to the rulings of the <b>Tawrah</b>, yet kill them while the <b>Tawrah</b> forbade you from killing them and from expelling them from their homes. The <b>Tawrah</b> also commanded that you should not aid the polytheists and those who associate with Allah in the worship against your brethren. You do all this to acquire the life of this world.' <br /> <br />I was informed that the behavior of the Jews regarding the Aws and Khazraj was the reason behind revealing these Ayat.&#34; <br /> <br />These noble <b>Ayat</b> criticized the Jews for implementing the <b>Tawrah</b> sometimes and defying it at other times, although they believed in the <b>Tawrah</b> and knew what they were doing was wrong. This is why they should not be trusted to preserve or convey the <b>Tawrah</b>. <br /> <br />Further, they should not be believed when it comes to the description of the Messenger of Allah, his coming, his expulsion from his land, and his <b>Hijrah</b>, and the rest of the information that the previous Prophets informed them about him, all of which they hid. <br /> <br />The Jews, may they suffer the curse of Allah, hid all of these facts among themselves, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَا جَزَاء مَن يَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلاَّ خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, <br /> <br />because they defied Allah's Law and commandments. <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَى أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />And on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment, <br /> <br />as punishment for defying the Book of Allah that they had. <br /> <br />وَمَا اللّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 84" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">85</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>85</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 86" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-86/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
