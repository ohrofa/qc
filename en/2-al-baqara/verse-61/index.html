So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.&#34; [Moses] said, &#34;Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.&#34; And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>And when you said, 'Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions.' He said, 'Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt; you shall have there that you demanded.' And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were laden with the burden of God's anger; that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, because they disobeyed, and were transgressors.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Remember when you said, ‘Moses, we cannot bear to eat only one kind of food, so pray to your Lord to bring out for us some of the earth’s produce, its herbs and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and onions.’ He said, ‘Would you exchange better for worse? Go to Egypt and there you will find what you have asked for.’ They were struck with humiliation and wretchedness, and they incurred the wrath of God because they persistently rejected His messages and killed prophets contrary to all that is right. All this was because they disobeyed and were lawbreakers.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we shall by no means bear patiently with one food, wherefore supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, of its vegetables, and its cucumbers, and its Wheat, and its lentils, and its onions. He Said: would ye take in exchange that which is mean for that which is better! Get ye down into a City, as verily therein is for you that which ye ask for. And stuck upon them were abjection and poverty. And they drew on themselves indignation from Allah. This, because they were ever disbelieving in the signs of Allah and slaying the prophets without justice. This, because they disobeyed and were ever trespassing.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>And remember ye said&#59; &#34;O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions.&#34; He said&#59; &#34;Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!&#34; They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Remember: You grumbled: &#34;O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like.&#34; Moses replied: &#34;What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler? Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.&#34; By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Remember, when you said: &#34;O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;&#34; he said: &#34;Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask.&#34; So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And when you said, “O Moosa! We shall never put up with only one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us what the earth grows – some herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions”; he said, “What!

And remember your ungratefulness for what We granted you. Remember how you asked Musa to exchange this type of food for an inferior type that consists of vegetation, and so forth.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said about the Children of Israel, <br /> <br />&#34;They were bored and impatient with the type of food they were provided. They also remembered the life they used to live, when their diet consisted of lentils, onions, garlic and herbs.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah tells, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَى لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىَ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الَارْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّأيِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا <br /> <br />They said, &#34;O Musa ! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fum, its lentils and its onions. <br /> <br />They said, <br />عَلَىَ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ <br />(One kind of food) meaning, <br /> <br />the <b>manna</b> and quails, because they ate the same food day after day. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> mentioned lentils, onions and herbs, which are all known types of foods. <br /> <br />As for the <b>Fum</b>, Ibn Mas`ud read it, <b>Thum</b> (garlic). <br /> <br />Also, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Al-Hasan said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَفُومِهَا <br />(Its <b>Fum</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;Ibn Abbas said that <b>Fum</b> means, garlic.&#34; <br /> <br />He also said that; <br /> <br />the expression, `<b>Fumu-lanna</b>' means, `bake for us', according to the languages of old. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented, <br /> <br />&#34;If this is true, then <b>`Fum</b>' is one of the words whose pronunciations were altered, the letter <b>`fa</b>' was replaced by the letter <b>`tha</b>', since they are similar in sound.&#34; And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Others said that <b>Fum</b> is wheat, the kind used for bread. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some of them said that <b>Fum</b> includes all grains or seeds that are eaten.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower!&#34; <br /> <br />criticized the Jews for asking for inferior foods, although they were living an easy life, eating tasty, beneficial and pure food. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />اهْبِطُواْ مِصْراً <br /> <br />Go you down to any <b>Misr</b>, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />means, `any city'. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir also reported that Abu Al-Aliyah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to <b>Misr</b>, the Egypt of Fir`awn. <br /> <br />The truth is that the <b>Ayah</b> means any city, as Ibn Abbas and other scholars stated. Therefore, the meaning of Musa's statement to the Children of Israel becomes, <br /> <br />&#34;What you are asking for is easy, for it is available in abundance in any city that you might enter. So since what you asked for is available in all of the villages and cities, I will not ask Allah to provide us with it, especially when it is an inferior type of food. &#34; <br /> <br />This is why Musa said to them, <br /> <br />أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ اهْبِطُواْ مِصْراً <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ <br /> <br />Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want! <br /> <br />Since their request was the result of boredom and arrogance and since fulfilling it was unnecessary, their request was denied. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /><b>Covering the Jews in Humiliation and Misery</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ <br /> <br />And they were covered with humiliation and misery. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that the Children of Israel were plagued with humiliation, and that this will continue, meaning that it will never cease. They will continue to suffer humiliation at the hands of all who interact with them, along with the disgrace that they feel inwardly. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah humiliated them, and they shall have no protector. Allah put them under the feet of the Muslims, who appeared at a time when the <b>Majus</b> (Zoroastrians) were taking the <b>Jizyah</b> (tax) from the Jews.&#34; <br /> <br />Also, Abu Al-Aliyah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />`misery' used in the <b>Ayah</b> means, `poverty.' <br /> <br />Atiyah Al-Awfi said that; <br /> <br />`misery' means, `paying the tilth (tax).' <br /> <br />In addition, Ad-Dahhak commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَبَأوُوْاْ بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah, <br /> <br />&#34;They deserved Allah's anger.&#34; <br /> <br />Also, Ibn Jarir said that the <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />&#34;They went back with the wrath. Similarly, Allah said, <br />إِنِّي أُرِيدُ أَن تَبُوءَ بِإِثْمِي وَإِثْمِكَ <br /> (Verily, I intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as yours), (5&#59;29) meaning, <br /> <br />`You will end up carrying my, and your, mistakes instead of me'. <br /> <br />Thus, the meaning of the <b>Ayah</b> becomes, <br /> <br />`They went back carrying Allah's anger; Allah's wrath descended on them; they deserved Allah's anger.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِأيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ <br /> <br />That was because they used to disbelieve in the <b>Ayat</b> (proofs, evidences, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. <br /> <br />means, &#34;This is what We rewarded the Children of Israel with&#59;humiliation and misery.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's anger that descended on the Children of Israel was a part of the humiliation they earned, because of their defiance of the truth, disbelief in Allah's <b>Ayat</b> and belittling the carriers of Allah's Law i.e. the Prophets and their following. The Children of Israel rejected the Messengers and even killed them. Surely, there is no form of disbelief worse than disbelieving in Allah's <b>Ayat</b> and murdering the Prophets of Allah. <br /><b>Meaning of Kibr</b> <br /> <br />Similarly, in a <b>Hadith</b> recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الْكِبْرُ بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس <br /><b>Kibr</b>, is refusing the truth and degrading (belittling) people. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded, Abdullah bin Mas`ud saying that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ رَجُلٌ قَتَلَهُ نَبِيٌّ أَوْ قَتَلَ نَبِيًّا وَإِمَامُ ضَلَلَةٍ وَمُمَثِّلٌ مِنَ الْمُمَثِّلِين <br /> <br />The people who will receive the most torment on the Day of Resurrection are&#59;a man who was killed by a Prophet or who killed a Prophet, an unjust ruler and one who mutilates (the dead). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds. <br /> <br />mentions another reason why the Children of Israel were punished in this manner, for they used to disobey and transgress the limits. Disobedience is to do what is prohibited, while transgression entails overstepping the set limits of what is allowed and what is prohibited. Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 60" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">61</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>61</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 62" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-62/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=61;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
