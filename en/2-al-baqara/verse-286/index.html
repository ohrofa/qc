Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#34; <br /> <br />We mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#34;I shall (accept your supplication).&#34; <br /> <br />There is also the <b>Hadith</b> by Ibn Abbas that Allah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I did (accept your supplication).&#34; <br /> <br />رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا <br /> <br />Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians), <br /> <br />means, &#34;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the <b>Hanifi</b> (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#34;I shall (accept your supplication).&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I did (accept your supplication).&#34; <br /> <br />There is the <b>Hadith</b> recorded through various chains of narration that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة <br /> <br />I was sent with the easy <b>Hanifiyyah</b> way. <br /> <br />رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ <br /> <br />Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear, <br /> <br />of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this. <br /> <br />رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ <br /> (Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear),We mentioned that Allah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I shall (accept your supplication)&#34; in one narration, <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />&#34;I did (accept your supplication),&#34; in another narration. <br /> <br />وَاعْفُ عَنَّا <br /> <br />Pardon us, <br /> <br />meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors. <br /> <br />وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا <br /> <br />And grant us forgiveness, <br /> <br />concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them. <br /> <br />وَارْحَمْنَأ <br /> <br />Have mercy on us, <br /> <br />in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. <br /> <br />They say that those who commit error need three things&#59; <br /> <br />Allah's forgiveness for what is between Him and them, <br /> <br />that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and <br /> <br />that He grants them immunity from further error.&#34; <br /> <br />We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#34;I shall,&#34; in one narration and, &#34;I did,&#34; in another narration. <br /> <br />أَنتَ مَوْلَانَا <br /> <br />You are our <b>Mawla</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You. <br /> <br />فَانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And give us victory over the disbelieving people. <br /> <br />those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet, worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said, &#34;I shall,&#34; in one narration, and, &#34;I did,&#34; in the <b>Hadith</b> that Muslim collected from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that; <br /> <br />whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this <b>Surah</b>, <b> <br />فَانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ <br /></b> (And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#34;<b>Amin</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>At-Baqarah</b>, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah. <br /> <br />Top</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah Verse 285" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-285/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">286</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>286</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=286;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
