(2&#59;146) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنبِيَاء اللّهِ مِن قَبْلُ إِن كُنتُم مُّوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;Why then have you killed the Prophets of Allah aforetime, if you indeed have been believers!&#34; <br /> <br />This means, &#34;If your claim that you believe in what was revealed to you is true, then why did you kill the Prophets who came to you affirming the <b>Tawrah's</b> Law, although you knew they were true Prophets! You killed them simply out of transgression, stubbornness and injustice with Allah's Messengers. Therefore, you only follow your lusts, opinions and desires.&#34; <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />أَفَكُلَّمَا جَأءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لَا تَهْوَى أَنفُسُكُم اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ <br /> <br />Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant! Some you disbelieved and some you killed. (2;87) <br /> <br />Also, As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah chastised the People of the Book, <br />قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنبِيَاء اللّهِ مِن قَبْلُ إِن كُنتُم مُّوْمِنِينَ <br /> (Say (O Muhammad to them)&#59;&#34;Why then have you killed the Prophets of Allah aforetime, if you indeed have been believers.&#34;</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 90" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 92" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=91;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
