has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which Allah has decreed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the sunset. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His ordinances to the people that they may become righteous.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them. God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you. So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you. And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques. Those are God's bounds; keep well within them. So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be godfearing.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>You [believers] are permitted to lie with your wives during the night of the fast: they are [close] as garments to you, as you are to them. God was aware that you were betraying yourselves, so He turned to you in mercy and pardoned you: now you can lie with them- seek what God has ordained for you- eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black. Then fast until nightfall. Do not lie with them during the nights of your devotional retreat in the mosques: these are the bounds set by God, so do not go near them. In this way God makes His messages clear to people, that they may guard themselves against doing wrong.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Allowed unto you, on the night of fasts, is consorting with your women. they are a garment unto you, and ye are a garment unto them.

So now, when it is permitted to you, lie with them, in sexual intercourse, and seek what God has prescribed for you, of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offspring; and eat and drink, [at any time] during the night, until the white thread is distinct, to you, from the black thread at daybreak, that is, the true [moment of daybreak], which explains the white thread, while the explanation of the black thread, namely, the night, has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn [twilight] are likened to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fast, from daybreak, to the night, that is, until it arrives, after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them, your women, while you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God], while you are residing [therein] with the intention of [performing] i`tikf (`spiritual retreat'). This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave [the mosque], whilst in a state of i`tikf, have sexual intercourse with his wife, and then return. Those, rulings mentioned, are God's bounds, delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do not approach them (l taqrabh, is more intense than l ta`taddh, `Do not overstep', used in verses elsewhere). So, just as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear [disobeying] His prohibitions.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Eating, Drinking and Sexual Intercourse are allowed during the Nights of Ramadan</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَأيِكُمْ <br /> <br />It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of <b>As-Siyam</b> (fasting). <br /> <br />These <b>Ayat</b> contain a relief from Allah for the Muslims by ending the practice that was observed in the early years of Islam. At that time, Muslims were allowed to eat, drink and have sexual intercourse only until the `<b>Isha</b>' (Night) prayer, unless one sleeps before the `<b>Isha</b>' prayer. Those who slept before `<b>Isha</b>' or offered the `<b>Isha</b>' prayer, were not allowed to drink, eat or sexual intercourse sex until the next night. The Muslims found that to be difficult for them. <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, Ata and Mujahid, <br /> <br />the <b>Ayat</b> used the word `<b>Rafath</b>' to indicate sexual intercourse, <br /> <br />Similar Tafsir was offered by Sa`id bin Jubayr, Tawus, Salim bin Abdullah, Amr bin Dinar, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri, Ad-Dahhak, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, As-Suddi, Ata Al-Khurasani and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ <br /> <br />They are <b>Libas</b> (i.e., body-cover, or screen) for you and you are <b>Libas</b> for them. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that this Ayah means, <br /> <br />&#34;Your wives are a resort for you and you for them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ar-Rabi bin Anas said, <br /> <br />&#34;They are your cover and you are their cover.&#34; <br /> <br />In short, the wife and the husband are intimate and have sexual intercourse with each other, and this is why they were permitted to have sexual activity during the nights of <b>Ramadan</b>, so that matters are made easier for them. <br /> <br />Abu Ishaq reported that Al-Bara bin Azib said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Companions of Allah's Messenger observed fast but would sleep before breaking their fast, they would continue fasting until the following night. <br /> <br />Qays bin Sirmah Al-Ansari was fasting one day and was working in his land. When the time to break the fast came, he went to his wife and said, `Do you have food?' <br /> <br />She said, `No. But I could try to get you some.' <br /> <br />His eyes then were overcome by sleep and when his wife came back, she found him asleep. She said, `Woe unto you! Did you sleep?' <br /> <br />In the middle of the next day, he lost consciousness and mentioned what had happened to the Prophet. <br /> <br />Then, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed&#59; <br />أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَأيِكُمْ <br /> (It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting)) until... <br />وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الَابْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الَاسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ <br /> (and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall). <br /> <br />Consequently, they were very delighted.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported this <b>Hadith</b> by Abu Ishaq who related that he heard Al-Bara say, <br /> <br />&#34;When fasting <b>Ramadan</b> was ordained, Muslims used to refrain from sleeping with their wives the entire month, but some men used to deceive themselves. <br /> <br />Allah revealed&#59; <br />عَلِمَ اللّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ <br /> (Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you).&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah narrated that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the month of <b>Ramadan</b>, after Muslims would pray `<b>Isha</b>', they would not touch their women and food until the next night. Then some Muslims, including Umar bin Al-Khattab, touched (had sex with) their wives and had some food during <b>Ramadan</b> after `<b>Isha</b>'. They complained to Allah's Messenger. Then Allah sent down&#59;<b> <br />عَلِمَ اللّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ فَالانَ بَاشِرُوهُنَّ <br /> <br /> <br /></b> (Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them).&#34; <br /> <br />This is the same narration that Al-Awfi related from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَابْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ اللّهُ لَكُمْ <br />and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah, Ibn Abbas, Anas, Shurayh Al-Qadi, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ata, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, Hakam bin Utbah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, and others said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> refers to having offspring. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that the <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />&#34;Seek the permission that Allah has allowed for you.&#34; <br /> <br />Sa`id narrated that Qatadah said, <b> <br />وَابْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ اللّهُ لَكُمْ <br /></b> (and seek that which Allah has ordained for you). <br /><b>Time for Suhur</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الَابْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الَاسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّليْلِ <br />and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall. <br /> <br />Allah has allowed eating and drinking, along with having sexual intercourse, as we have stated, during any part of the night until the light of dawn is distinguished from the darkness of the night. <br /> <br />Allah has described that time as `distinguishing the white thread from the black thread.' He then made it clearer when He said&#59; <br />مِنَ الْفَجْرِ <br /> (of dawn). <br /> <br />As stated in a <b>Hadith</b> that Imam Abu Abdullah Al-Bukhari recorded, Sahl bin Sa`d said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the following verse was revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الَابْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الَاسْوَدِ <br /> (Eat and drink until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the black thread), and (of dawn) was not revealed, some people who intended to fast, tied black and white threads to their legs and went on eating till they differentiated between the two. <br /> <br />Allah then revealed the words, (of dawn), and it became clear to them that it meant (the darkness of) night and (the light of) day.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said that Adi said, <br /> <br />&#34;I took two strings, one black and the other white and kept them under my pillow and went on looking at them throughout the night, but could not make any distinction between the two. <br /> <br />So, the next morning I went to Allah's Messenger and told him the whole story. He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ وِسَادَكَ إِذًا لَعَرِيضٌ أَنْ كَانَ الْخَيْطُ الاَْبْيَضُ وَالاَْسْوَدُ تَحْتَ وِسَادَتِك <br /> <br />Your pillow is very wide if the white and black threads are under it! <br /> <br />Some wordings for this <b>Hadith</b> read, <br /> <br />إِنَّكَ لَعَرِيضُ الْقَفَا <br /> <br />Your <b>Qafa</b> (back side of your neck) is wide! <br /> <br />Some people said that these words meant that Adi was not smart. This is a weak opinion. <br /> <br />The narration that Al-Bukhari collected explains this part of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Adi bin Hatim narrated&#59; <br /> <br />I said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! What is the white thread from the black thread? Are they actual threads?&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />إنَّكَ لَعَرِيضُ الْقَفَا أَنْ أَبْصَرْتَ الْخَيْطَيْنِ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَا بَلْ هُوَ سَوَادُ اللَّيْلِ وَبَيَاضُ النَّهَار <br /> <br />Your <b>Qafa</b> is wide if you see the two threads. Rather, they are the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the daylight. <br /><b>Suhur is Recommended</b> <br /> <br />Allah allowed eating and drinking until dawn, it represents proof that <b>Suhur</b> is encouraged, since it is a <b>Rukhsah</b> (concession or allowance) and Allah likes that the <b>Rukhsah</b> is accepted and implemented. <br /> <br />The authentic <b>Sunnah</b> indicates that eating the <b>Suhur</b> is encouraged. <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Anas narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />تَسَحَّرُوا فَإِنَّ فِي السَّحُورِ بَرَكَة <br /> <br />Eat the <b>Suhur</b>, for there is a blessing in <b>Suhur</b>. <br /> <br />Muslim reported that Amr bin Al-As narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ فَصْلَ مَا بَيْنَ صِيَامِنَا وصِيَامِ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ أَكْلَةُ السَّحَر <br /> <br />The distinction between our fast and the fast of the People of the Book is the meal of <b>Suhur</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Sa`id narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />السَّحُورُ أَكْلُهُ بَرَكَةٌ فَلَ تَدَعُوهُ وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ تَجْرَعُ جُرْعَةَ مَاءٍ فَإِنَّ اللهَ وَمَلَيِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّون عَلَى الْمُتَسَحِّرِين <br /><b>Suhur</b> is a blessed meal. Hence, do not abandon it, even if one just takes a sip of water. Indeed, Allah and His angels send <b>Salah</b> (blessings) upon those who eat <b>Suhur</b>. <br /> <br />There are several other <b>Hadiths</b> that encourage taking the <b>Suhur</b>, even if it only consists of a sip of water. <br /> <br />It is preferred that <b>Suhur</b> be delayed until the time of dawn. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Anas bin Malik narrated that Zayd bin Thabit said, <br /> <br />&#34;We had <b>Suhur</b> with Allah's Messenger and then went on to pray.&#34; <br /> <br />Anas asked, &#34;How much time was there between the <b>Adhan</b> (call to prayer) and the <b>Suhur</b>?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;The time that fifty <b>Ayat</b> take (to recite).&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Dharr saying that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تَزَالُ أُمَّتِي بِخَيْرٍ مَا عَجَّلُوا الاْاِفْطَارَ وَأَخَّرُوا السُّحُور <br /> <br />My <b>Ummah</b> will always retain goodness as long as they hasten in breaking the fast and delay the <b>Suhur</b>. <br /> <br />There are several <b>Hadiths</b> that narrate that, <br /> <br />the Prophet called Suhur &#34;the blessed meal.&#34; <br /> <br />There are narrations from several of the <b>Salaf</b> that; <br /> <br />they allowed the <b>Suhur</b> to be eaten later until close to <b>Fajr</b>. <br /> <br />This is reported from Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Hudhayfah, Abu Hurayrah, Ibn Umar, Ibn Abbas and Zayd bin Thabit. <br /> <br />It is also reported from many of the Tabi`in, such as Muhammad bin Ali bin Husayn, Abu Mijlaz, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Abu Ad-Duha, Abu Wa'il and other companions of Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Ata, Al-Hasan, Hakam bin Uyainah, Mujahid, Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Abu Shatha Jabir bin Zayd, Al- Amash and Ma`mar bin Rashid. <br /> <br />We have mentioned the chains of narrations for their statements in our (Ibn Kathir's) book about <b>Siyam</b> (Fasting), and all praise is due to Allah. <br /> <br />It is also recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Al-Qasim said that Aishah narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَمْنَعُكُمْ أَذَانُ بِلَالٍ عَنْ سَحُورِكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ يُنَادِي بِلَيْلٍ فَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّى تَسْمَعُوا أَذَانَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ لَا يُوَذِّنُ حَتَّى يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْر <br /> <br />The <b>Adhan</b> pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking <b>Suhur</b>, for he pronounces the <b>Adhan</b> at night. Hence, eat and drink until you hear the <b>Adhan</b> by Ibn Umm Maktum, for he does not call the <b>Adhan</b> until dawn. <br /> <br />This is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Qays bin Talq quoted from his father that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ الْفَجْرُ الْمُسْتَطِيلَ فِي الاُْفُقِ وَلَكِنِ الْمُعْتَرِضُ الاَْحْمَر <br /> <br />Dawn is not the (ascending) glow of white light of the horizon. Rather, it is the red (radiating) light. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, but their wording is&#59; <br /> <br />كُلُوا واشْرَبُوا وَلَا يَهِيدَنَّكُمُ السَّاطِعُ الْمُصْعِدُ فَكُلُوا واشْرَبُوا حَتَّى يَعْتَرِضَ لَكُمُ الاَْحْمَر <br /> <br />Eat and drink and do not be rushed by the ascending (white) light. Eat and drink until the redness (of the dawn) appears. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) recorded that Samurah bin Jundub narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ أَذَانُ بِلَالٍ وَلَاا هَذَا الْبَيَاضُ لِعَمُودِ الصُّبْحِ حَتَّى يَسْتَطِير <br /> <br />Do not be stopped by Bilal's <b>Adhan</b> or the (ascending) whiteness, until it spreads. <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /><b>There is no Harm in beginning the Fast while Junub (a state of major ritual impurity)</b> <br /><b>Issue</b>&#59; <br /> <br />Among the benefits of allowing sexual activity, eating and drinking until dawn for those who are fasting, is that it is allowed to start the fast while <b>Junub</b> (in the state of impurity after sexual discharge), and there is no harm in this case if one takes a bath any time in the morning after waking up, and completes the fast. <br /> <br />This is the opinion of the Four <b>Imams</b> and the majority of the scholars. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Aishah and Umm Salamah said that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger used to wake up while <b>Junub</b> from sexual intercourse, not wet dreams, and he would take a bath and fast. <br /> <br />Umm Salamah added that he would not break his fast or make up for that day. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Aishah said that a man asked&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah! The (Dawn) prayer time starts while I am <b>Junub</b>, should I fast?&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger replied, <br /> <br />وَأَنَا تُدْرِكُنِي الصَّلةُ وَأَنَا جُنُبٌ فَأَصُوم <br /> <br />And I, the prayer time starts while I am <b>Junub</b> and I fast. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;You are not like us, O Messenger of Allah! Allah has forgiven your previous and latter sins.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللهِ إِنَّي لَااَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَخْشَاكُمْ للهِ وَأَعْلَمَكُمْ بِمَا أَتَّقِي <br /> <br />By Allah! I hope that I have the most fear from Allah among you and the best knowledge of what <b>Taqwa</b> is. <br /><b>Fasting ends at Sunset</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّليْلِ <br />then complete your fast till the nightfall. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> orders breaking the fast at sunset. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Umar bin Al-Khattab said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا أَقْبَلَ اللَّيْلُ مِنْ ههُنَا وَأَدْبَرَ النَّهَارُ مِنْ ههُنَا فَقَدْ أَفْطَرَ الصَّايِم <br /> <br />If the night comes from this direction (the east), and the day departs from that direction (the west), then the fasting person breaks his fast. <br /> <br />It is reported that Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا عَجَّلُوا الْفِطْر <br /> <br />The people will retain goodness as long as they hasten in breaking the fast. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِنَّ أَحَبَّ عِبَادِي إِلَيَّ أَعْجَلُهُمْ فِطْرًا <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, `the dearest among My servants to Me are those who hasten in breaking the fast the most.' <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded this <b>Hadith</b> and said that this <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan Gharib</b>. <br /><b>Prohibition of Uninterrupted Fasting (Wisal)</b> <br /> <br />There are several authentic <b>Hadiths</b> that prohibit <b>Al-Wisal</b>, which means continuing the fast through the night to the next night, without eating. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تُوَاصِلُوا <br /> <br />Do not practice <b>Al-Wisal</b> in fasting. <br /> <br />So, they said to him, &#34;But you practice Al-Wisal, O Allah's Messenger!&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet replied, <br /> <br />فَإِنِّي لَسْتُ مِثْلَكُمْ إِنِّي أَبِيتُ يُطْعِمُنِي رَبِّي وَيَسْقِينِي <br /> <br />&#34;I am not like you, I am given food and drink during my sleep by my Lord.&#34; <br /> <br />So, when the people refused to stop <b>Al-Wisal</b>, the Prophet fasted two days and two nights (along with those who practiced <b>Wisal</b>) and then they saw the crescent moon (of the month of <b>Shawwal</b>). The Prophet said to them (angrily)&#59; <br /> <br />لَوْ تَأَخَّرَ الْهِلَلُ لَزِدْتُكُم <br /> <br />If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you fast for a longer period. <br /> <br />That was as a punishment for them (when they refused to stop practicing <b>Al-Wisal</b>). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also recorded in the <b>Sahihayn</b>. <br /> <br />The prohibition of <b>Al-Wisal</b> was also mentioned in a number of other narrations. It is a fact that practicing <b>Al-Wisal</b> was one of the special qualities of the Prophet, for he was capable and assisted in his practice of it. It is obvious that the food and drink that the Prophet used to get while practicing <b>Al-Wisal</b> was spiritual and not material, otherwise he would not be practicing <b>Al-Wisal</b>. <br /> <br />We should mention that it is allowed to refrain from breaking the fast from sunset until before dawn (<b>Suhur</b>). <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> narrated by Abu Sa`id Khudri states that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تُوَاصِلُوا فَأَيُّكُمْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُوَاصِلَ فَلْيُوَاصِلْ إِلَى السَّحَر <br /> <br />Do not practice <b>Al-Wisal</b>, but whoever wishes is allowed to practice it until the <b>Suhur</b>. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;You practice <b>Al-Wisal</b>, O Messenger of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنِّي لَسْتُ كَهَيْيَتِكُمْ إِنِّي أَبِيتُ لِي مُطْعِمٌ يُطْعِمُنِي وَسَاقٍ يَسْقِينِي <br /> <br />I am not similar to you, for I have One Who makes me eat and drink during the night. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /><b>The Rulings of Itikaf</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ <br /> <br />And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in <b>Itikaf</b> in the <b>Masjids</b>. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> is about the man who stays in <b>Itikaf</b> at the mosque during <b>Ramadan</b> or other months, Allah prohibited him from touching (having sexual intercourse with) women, during the night or day, until he finishes his <b>Itikaf</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said, <br /> <br />&#34;Formerly, the man who practiced <b>Itikaf</b> would go out of the mosque and, if he wished, would have sexual intercourse (with his wife). Allah then said&#59; <br />وَلَا تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ <br /> (And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in <b>Itikaf</b> in the <b>Masjids</b>. <br /> <br />meaning, `Do not touch your wives as long as you are in <b>Itikaf</b>, whether you were in the mosque or outside of it'.&#34; <br /> <br />It is also the opinion of Mujahid, Qatadah and several other scholars, that; <br /> <br />the Muslims used to have sexual intercourse with the wife while in <b>Itikaf</b> if they departed the mosque until the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed. <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim commented, &#34;It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Mujahid, Ata Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Muqatil said that the <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />`Do not touch the wife while in <b>Itikaf</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />What Ibn Abu Hatim reported from these people is the agreed upon practice among the scholars. <br /> <br />Those who are in <b>Itikaf</b> are not allowed to have sexual intercourse as long as they are still in <b>Itikaf</b> in the mosque. If one has to leave the mosque to attend to a need, such as to relieve the call of nature or to eat, he is not allowed to kiss or embrace his wife or to busy himself with other than his <b>Itikaf</b>. He is not even allowed to visit ailing persons, but he can merely ask about their condition while passing by. <br /><b>Itikaf</b> has several other rulings that are explained in the books (of <b>Fiqh</b>), and we have mentioned several of these rulings at the end of our book on <b>Siyam</b> (Fasting), all praise is due to Allah. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the scholars of <b>Fiqh</b> used to follow their explanation of the rules for fasting with the explanation of the rules for <b>Itikaf</b>, as this is the way these acts of worship were mentioned in the Qur'an. <br /> <br />By mentioning <b>Itikaf</b> after fasting, Allah draws attention to practicing <b>Itikaf</b> during the month of the fast, especially the last part of the month. The <b>Sunnah</b> of Allah's Messenger is that he used to perform <b>Itikaf</b> during the last ten nights of the month of <b>Ramadan</b> until he died. <br /> <br />Afterwards, the Prophet's wives used to perform <b>Itikaf</b> as the Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded from Aishah the Mother of the believers. <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that; <br /> <br />Safiyyah, the daughter of Huyai, went to Allah's Messenger to visit him in the mosque while he was in <b>Itikaf</b>. <br /> <br />She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her back home, as it was night. Her house was at Usamah bin Zayd's house on the edge of Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />While they were walking, two Ansari men met them and passed by them in a hurry, for they were shy to bother the Prophet while he was walking with his wife. He told them&#59; <br /> <br />عَلى رِسْلِكُمَا إِنَّهَا صَفِيَّةُ بِنْتُ حُيَي <br /> <br />Do not run away! She is (my wife) Safiyyah bint Huyai. <br /> <br />Both of them said, &#34;All praise is due to Allah, How dare we think of any evil? O Allah's Messenger!&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said (to them)&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ يَجْرِي مِنِ ابْنِ ادَمَ مَجْرَى الدَّمِ وَإِنِّي خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَقْذِفَ فِي قُلُوبِكُمَا شَيْيًا أَوْ قَالَ شَرًّا <br /><b>Shaytan</b> reaches everywhere in the human body, that the blood reaches. I was afraid lest <b>Shaytan</b> might suggest an evil thought in your minds. <br /> <br />Imam Ash-Shafii commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger sought to teach his <b>Ummah</b> to instantly eliminate any evil thought, so that they do not fall into the prohibited. They (the two Ansari men) had more fear of Allah than to think evil of the Prophet. Allah knows best.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;187) prohibits sexual intercourse and anything like kissing or embracing that might lead to it during <b>Itikaf</b>. As for having the wife helping the husband, it is allowed. <br /> <br />It is reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger would bring his head near me (in her room) and I would comb his hair, while I was on my menses. He would enter the room only to attend to what a man needs.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللّهِ <br /> <br />These are the limits (set) by Allah, <br /> <br />means, `This is what We have explained, ordained, specified, allowed and prohibited for fasting. We also mentioned the fast's objectives, what is permitted during it, and what is required of it. These are the set limits that Allah has legislated and explained, so do not come near them or transgress them.' <br /> <br />لَا تَقْرَبُوهَا <br /> <br />so approach them not. <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's set limits mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> mean these four limits (and he then recited)&#59; <br />أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَأيِكُمْ <br /> (It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of <b>As-Siyam</b> (fasting).) and he recited up to&#59;<b> <br />ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّليْلِ <br /></b> (then complete your <b>Sawm</b> (fast) till the nightfall). <br /> <br />My father and other's used to say similarly and recite the same <b>Ayah</b> to us.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ ايَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />Thus does Allah make clear His <b>Ayat</b> to mankind, <br /> <br />meaning, `Just as He explains the fast and its rulings, He also explains the other rulings by the words of His servant and Messenger, Muhammad.' <br /> <br />Allah continues&#59; <br /> <br />لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />to mankind that they may attain <b>Taqwa</b>. <br /> <br />meaning, `So that they know how to acquire the true guidance and how to worship (Allah).' <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br />It is He Who sends down manifest <b>Ayat</b> to His servant (Muhammad) that He may bring you out from (types of) darkness into the light. And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.
