The Sunna clarifies the permissibility of making pledges in towns, where writers may be forthcoming; but the stipulation is made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God's reference to it being `in hand' (maqbda) is a condition for the pledge given to be valid, and to satisfy the pledgee or his representative. But if one of you, the creditor, trusts another, the debtor, over the debt and does not require a pledge, let him who is trusted, the debtor, deliver his trust, the debt; and let him fear God his Lord, when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony, if you are summoned to give it; whoever conceals it, his heart is sinful&#59; the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony, and because if it sins, there are other sinful consequences, and so the person will be punished as though he were a sinner; and God knows what you do, nothing of which can be hidden from Him.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>What is the `Mortgaging' Mentioned in the Ayah</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ <br /> <br />And if you are on a journey, <br /> <br />meaning, traveling and some of you borrowed some money to be paid at a later date. <br /> <br />وَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ كَاتِبًا <br /> <br />and cannot find a scribe, <br /> <br />who would record the debt for you. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;And even if they find a scribe, but did not find paper, ink or pen.&#34; <br /> <br />Then, <br /> <br />فَرِهَانٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ <br /> <br />let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging), <br /> <br />given to the creditor in lieu of writing the transaction. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that; <br /> <br />Anas said that the Messenger of Allah died while his shield was mortgaged with a Jew in return for thirty <b>Wasq</b> (approximately 180 kg) of barley, which the Prophet bought on credit as provisions for his household. <br /> <br />In another narration, the <b>Hadith</b> stated that this Jew was among the Jews of Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُوَدِّ الَّذِي اوْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ <br /> <br />then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully). <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, with a sound chain of narration, that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> abrogated what came before it (i.e. that which required recording the transaction and having witnesses present).&#34; <br /> <br />Ash-Sha`bi said, <br /> <br />&#34;If you trust each other, then there is no harm if you do not write the loan or have witnesses present.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلْيَتَّقِ اللّهَ رَبَّهُ <br /> <br />And let him have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, <br /> <br />means, the debtor. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and the <b>Sunan</b> recorded that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />عَلَى الْيَدِ مَا أَخَذَتْ حَتَّى تُوَدِّيَه <br /> <br />The hand (of the debtor) will carry the burden of what it took until it gives it back. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَكْتُمُواْ الشَّهَادَةَ <br /> <br />And conceal not the evidence, <br /> <br />means, do not hide it or refuse to announce it. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and other scholars said, <br /> <br />&#34;False testimony is one of the worst of the major sins, and such is the case with hiding the true testimony. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ اثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ <br /> <br />For he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. <br /> <br />As-Suddi commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Meaning he is a sinner in his heart.&#34; <br /> <br />This is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَـدَةَ اللَّهِ إِنَّأ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ الاٌّثِمِينَ <br /> <br />We shall not hide testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful. (5&#59;106) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ بِالْقِسْطِ شُهَدَاءِ للَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوِ الْوَلِدَيْنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيّاً أَوْ فَقَيراً فَاللَّهُ أَوْلَى بِهِمَا فَلَ تَتَّبِعُواْ الْهَوَى أَن تَعْدِلُواْ وَإِن تَلْوُواْ أَوْ تُعْرِضُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً <br /> <br />O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, be he rich or poor, Allah is a better Protector to both (than you). <br /> <br />So follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you avoid justice; and if you distort your witness or refuse to give it, verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do. (4&#59;135) <br /> <br />and in this <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;283) He said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَكْتُمُواْ الشَّهَادَةَ <br /> <br />وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ اثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And conceal not the evidence, for he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. And Allah is All-Knower of what you do.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 282" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-282/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">283</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>283</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 284" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-284/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=283;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
