freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>It is not piety, that you turn your faces to the East and to the West. True piety is this: to believe in God, and the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the Prophets, to give of one's substance, however cherished, to kinsmen, and orphans, the needy, the traveller, beggars, and to ransom the slave, to perform the prayer, to pay the alms. And they who fulfil their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, and endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship and peril, these are they who are true in their faith, these are the truly godfearing.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Goodness does not consist in turning your face towards East or West. The truly good are those who believe in God and the Last Day, in the angels, the Scripture, and the prophets; who give away some of their wealth, however much they cherish it, to their relatives, to orphans, the needy, travellers and beggars, and to liberate those in bondage; those who keep up the prayer and pay the prescribed alms; who keep pledges whenever they make them; who are steadfast in misfortune, adversity, and times of danger. These are the ones who are true, and it is they who are aware of God.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Virtue is not in this that ye turn your faces toward the east and west, but virtue is of him who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the prophets: and giveth of his substance, for love of Him unto kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for redeeming necks, and establisheth prayer and giveth the poor-rate and is of the performers of their covenant when they have covenanted; and is of the patient in adversity and affliction and in time or violence these are they who are proven true, and these they are God-fearing.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>It is no virtue. That you turn your faces towards the east or the west, but virtue is that one should sincerely believe in Allah and the Last Day and the Angels and the Book and the Prophets and, out of His love, spend of one's choice wealth for relatives and orphans, for the needy and the wayfarer, for beggars and for the ransom of slaves, and establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. And the virtuous are those who keep their pledges when they make them and show fortitude in hardships and adversity and in the struggle between the Truth and falsehood; such are the truthful people and such are the pious.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Piety does not lie in turning your face to East or West: Piety lies in believing in God, the Last Day and the angels, the Scriptures and the prophets, and disbursing your wealth out of love for God among your kin and the orphans, the wayfarers and mendicants, freeing the slaves, observing your devotional obligations, and in paying the zakat and fulfilling a pledge you have given, and being patient in hardship, adversity, and times of peril.

Allah says; <br /> <br />لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ وَالْمَليِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ <br /> <br />It is not <b>Birr</b> that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west; but <b>Birr</b> is the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets..., <br /> <br />As for the explanation of this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah first commanded the believers to face<b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>, and then to face the <b>Ka`bah</b> during the prayer. This change was difficult for some of the People of the Book, and even for some Muslims. <br /> <br />Then Allah sent revelation which clarified the wisdom behind this command, that is, obedience to Allah, adhering to His commands, facing wherever He commands facing, and implementing whatever He legislates, that is the objective. This is <b>Birr</b>, <b>Taqwa</b> and complete faith. Facing the east or the west does not necessitate righteousness or obedience, unless it is legislated by Allah. This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ <br /> <br />It is not <b>Birr</b> that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but <b>Birr</b> is the one who believes in Allah and the Last Day, <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said about the sacrifices&#59; <br /> <br />لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَأوُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is the piety from you that reaches Him. (22&#59;37) <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews used to face the west for their <b>Qiblah</b>, while the Christians used to face the east for their Qiblah. So Allah said&#59; <br />لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ <br /> (It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers)), <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;this is faith, and its essence requires implementation.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Al-Hasan and Ar-Rabi bin Anas. <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri recited&#59; <br />وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللّهِ <br /> (but <b>Birr</b> is the one who believes in Allah), and said that; <br /> <br />what follows are the types of <b>Birr</b>. <br /> <br />He has said the truth. Certainly, those who acquire the qualities mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> will have indeed embraced all aspects of Islam and implemented all types of righteousness; believing in Allah, that He is the only God worthy of worship, and believing in the angels the emissaries between Allah and His Messengers. <br /> <br />The `Books' are the Divinely revealed Books from Allah to the Prophets, which were finalized by the most honorable Book (the Qur'an). The Qur'an supercedes all previous Books, it mentions all types of righteousness, and the way to happiness in this life and the Hereafter. The Qur'an abrogates all previous Books and testifies to all of Allah's Prophets, from the first Prophet to the Final Prophet, Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَاتَى الْمَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ <br />and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, <br /> <br />refers to those who give money away while desiring it and loving it. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the <b>Sahihayn</b> that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقةِ أَنْ تَصَدَّقَ وَأَنْتَ صَحِيحٌ شَحِيحٌ تَأْمُلُ الْغِنَى وتَخْشَى الْفقْر <br /> <br />The best charity is when you give it away while still healthy and thrifty, hoping to get rich and fearing poverty. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَاءً وَلَا شُكُوراً <br /> <br />And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the <b>Miskin</b> (the poor), the orphan, and the captive (saying)&#59;&#34;We feed you seeking Allah's Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you.&#34; (76&#59;8, 9) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ <br /> <br />By no means shall you attain <b>Birr</b> unless you spend of that which you love. (3&#59;92) <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَيُوْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ <br />and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that, (59&#59;9), <br /> <br />refers to a higher category and status, as the people mentioned here give away what they need, while those mentioned in the previous <b>Ayat</b> give away what they covet (but not necessarily need). <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />ذَوِي الْقُرْبَى <br /> <br />the kinsfolk, <br /> <br />refers to man's relatives, who have more rights than anyone else to one's charity, as the <b>Hadith</b> supports&#59; <br /> <br />الصَّدَقَةُ عَلَى الْمَسَاكِينِ صَدَقَةٌ وعَلَى ذِي الرَّحِمِ اثْنتَانِ صَدَقَةٌ وَصِلَـةٌ فَهُمْ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِكَ وَبِبِرِّكَ وَإِعْطَايِك <br /><b>Sadaqah</b> (i.e., charity) given to the poor is a charity, while the <b>Sadaqah</b> given to the relatives is both <b>Sadaqah</b> and <b>Silah</b> (nurturing relations), for they are the most deserving of you and your kindness and charity. <br /> <br />Allah has commanded kindness to the relatives in many places in the Qur'an. <br /> <br />وَالْيَتَامَى <br /> <br />to the orphans, <br /> <br />The orphans are children who have none to look after them, having lost their fathers while they are still young, weak and unable to find their own sustenance since they have not reached the age of work and adolescence. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ali said that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />وَالْمَسَاكِينَ <br /> <br />and to <b>Al-Masakin</b>, <br /> <br />The <b>Miskin</b> is the person who does not have enough food, clothing, or he has no dwelling. So the <b>Miskin</b> should be granted the provisions to sustain him enough so that he can acquire his needs. <br /> <br />In the <b>Sahihayn</b> it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّه التَّمْرَةُ والتَّمْرَتَانِ واللُّقْمَةُ واللُّقْمَتَانِ وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيه وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتصَدَّقَ عَلَيْه <br /> <br />The <b>Miskin</b> is not the person who roams around, and whose need is met by one or two dates or one or two bites. Rather, the <b>Miskin</b> is he who does not have what is sufficient, and to whom the people do not pay attention and, thus, do not give him from the charity. <br /> <br />وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ <br /> <br />and to the wayfarer, <br /> <br />is the needy traveler who runs out of money and should, thus, be granted whatever amount that helps him to go back to his land. Such is the case with whoever intends to go on a permissible journey, he is given what he needs for his journey and back. <br /> <br />The guests are included in this category. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Ibn As-Sabil</b> (wayfarer) is the guest who is hosted by Muslims.&#34; <br /> <br />Furthermore, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Jafar Al-Baqir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Muqatil bin Hayyan said similarly. <br /> <br />وَالسَّأيِلِينَ <br /> <br />and to those who ask, <br /> <br />refers to those who beg people and are thus given a part of the <b>Zakah</b> and general charity. <br /> <br />وَفِي الرِّقَابِ <br /> <br />and to set servants free, <br /> <br />These are the servants who seek to free themselves, but cannot find enough money to buy their freedom. <br /> <br />We will mention several of these categories and types under the Tafsir of the <b>Ayah</b> on <b>Sadaqah</b> in Surah <b>Bara'h</b>, if Allah Willing. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَقَامَ الصَّلةَ <br /> <br />performs <b>As-Salah</b> (<b>Iqamat-As-Salah</b>), <br /> <br />means, those who pray on time and give the prayer its due right; the bowing, prostration, and the necessary attention and humbleness required by Allah. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَاتَى الزَّكَاةَ <br /> <br />and gives the <b>Zakah</b>, <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr and Muqatil bin Hayyan have stated, <br /> <br />means, the required charity (<b>Zakah</b>) due on one's money. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُواْ <br /> <br />and who fulfill their covenant when they make it, <br /> <br />is similar to&#59; <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يِنقُضُونَ الْمِيثَـقَ <br /> <br />Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the <b>Mithaq</b> (bond, treaty, covenant). (13&#59;20) <br /> <br />The opposite of this characteristic is hypocrisy. As found in a <b>Hadith</b>&#59; <br /> <br />ايَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَثٌ <br /> <br />إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ <br /> <br />وَإذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ <br /> <br />وَإذَا ايْتُمِنَ خَان <br /> <br />The signs of a hypocrite are three&#59; <br /> <br />if he speaks, he lies; <br /> <br />if he promises, he breaks his promise; <br /> <br />and if he is entrusted, he breaches the trust. <br /> <br />In another version&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ <br /> <br />وَإذَا عَاهَدَ غَدَرَ <br /> <br />وَإذَا خَاصَمَ فَجَر <br /> <br />If he speaks, he lies; <br /> <br />if he vows, he breaks his vow; <br /> <br />and if he disputes, he is lewd. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِي الْبَأْسَاء والضَّرَّاء وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ <br />and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). <br /> <br />means, during the time of meekness and ailment. <br /> <br />وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ <br /> (...and at the time of fighting (during the battles), <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn Abbas, Abu Al-Aliyah, Murrah Al-Hamdani, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak and others have stated, <br /> <br />means on the battlefield while facing the enemy. <br /> <br />And calling them the patient here, is a form of praise, because of the importance of patience in these circumstances, and the suffering and difficulties that accompany them. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best, it is He Whom help is sought from, and upon Him we rely. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />أُولَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا <br /> <br />Such are the people of the truth, <br /> <br />means, whoever acquires these qualities, these are truthful in their faith. This is because they have achieved faith in the heart and realized it in deed and upon the tongue. <br /> <br />So they are the truthful, <br /> <br />وَأُولَـيِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they are <b>Al-Muttaqun</b> (the pious). <br /> <br />because they avoided the prohibitions and performed the acts of obedience</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 176" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-176/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">177</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>177</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 178" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-178/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=2,sura_dir="al-baqara",count_ayat=286,number_aya=177;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
