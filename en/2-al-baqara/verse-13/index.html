This is why, according to the majority of the scholars, Allah used the term foolish to include children, when He said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تُوْتُواْ السُّفَهَأءَ أَمْوَلَكُمُ الَّتِى جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ قِيَـماً <br /> <br />And do not give your property, which Allah has made a means of support for you, to the foolish. (4&#59;5) <br /> <br />Allah answered the hypocrites in all of these instances. For instance, Allah said here, <br /> <br />أَلا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَاء <br /> <br />Verily, they are the fools. <br /> <br />Allah thus affirmed that the hypocrites are indeed the fools. <br /> <br />yet, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But they know not. <br /> <br />Since they are so thoroughly ignorant, the hypocrites are unaware of their degree of deviation and ignorance, and such situation is more dangerous, a severer case of blindness, and further from the truth than one who is aware</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 12" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 14" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
