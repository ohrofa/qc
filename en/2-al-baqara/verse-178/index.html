The Sunna makes it clear that a male may be killed [in retaliation] for a female, and that religious affiliation should be taken into account also, so that a Muslim cannot be killed in return for an disbeliever, even if the former be a slave and the latter a free man. But if anything, of the blood, is pardoned any one, of those who have slain, in relation to his brother, the one slain, so that the retaliation is waived (the use of the indefinite shay'un, `anything', here implies the waiving of retaliation through a partial pardon by the inheritors [of the slain]; the mention of akhh [`his brother'] is intended as a conciliatory entreaty to pardon and a declaration that killing should not sever the bonds of religious brotherhood; the particle man, `any one', is the subject of a conditional or a relative clause, of which the predicate is [the following, fa'ittib`un]) let the pursuing, that is, the action of the one who has pardoned in pursuing the killer, be honourable, demanding the blood money without force. The fact that the `pursuing' results from the `pardoning' implies that one of the two [actions] is a duty, which is one of al-Shfi`'s two opinions here. The other [opinion] is that retaliation is the duty, whereas the blood money is merely compensation [for non-retaliation], so that if one were to pardon but not name his blood money, then nothing [happens]; and this [latter] is the preferred [opinion]. And let the payment, of the blood money by the slayer, to him, the pardoner, that is, the one inheriting [from the slain], be with kindliness, without procrastination or fraud; that, stipulation mentioned here about the possibility of retaliation and the forgoing of this in return for blood money, is an alleviation, a facilitation, given, to you, by your Lord, and a mercy, for you, for He has given you latitude in this matter and has not categorically demanded that one [of the said options] be followed through, in the way that He made it obligatory for Jews to retaliate and for Christians to [pardon and] accept blood money; and for him who commits aggression, by being unjust towards the killer and slaying him, after that, that is, [after] pardoning -- his is a painful chastisement, of the Fire in the Hereafter, or of being killed in this world.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Command and the Wisdom behind the Law of Equality</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ <br />كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالاُنثَى بِالاُنثَى <br /> <br />O you who believe! <b>Al-Qisas</b> (the Law of equality) is prescribed for you in case of murder&#59;the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. <br /> <br />Allah states&#59;O believers!

Therefore, do not transgress the set limits, as others before you transgressed them, and thus changed what Allah has ordained for them. <br /> <br />The reason behind this statement is that (the Jewish tribe of) Banu An-Nadir invaded Qurayzah (another Jewish tribe) during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b> (before Islam) and defeated them. Hence, (they made it a law that) when a person from Nadir kills a person from Quraizah, he is not killed in retaliation, but only pays a hundred <b>Wasq</b> of dates. However, when a person from Quraizah kills a Nadir man, he would be killed for him. If Nadir wanted (to forfeit the execution of the murderer and instead require him) to pay a ransom, the Quraizah man pays two hundred <b>Wasq</b> of dates (double the amount Nadir pays in <b>Diyah</b> (blood money)). So Allah commanded that justice be observed regarding the penal code, and that the path of the misguided and mischievous persons be avoided, who in disbelief and transgression, defy and alter what Allah has commanded them. Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالاُنثَى بِالاُنثَى <br /> <br /><b>Al-Qisas</b> (the Law of equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in case of murder&#59;the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br />الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالاُنثَى بِالاُنثَى <br /> (the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female) was abrogated by the statement life for life (5&#59;45). <br /> <br />However, the majority of scholars agree that the Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever whom he kills. <br /> <br />Al- Bukhari reported that Ali narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يُقْتَلُ مُسْلِمٌ بِكَافِر <br /> <br />The Muslim is not killed for the disbeliever (whom he kills). <br /> <br />No opinion that opposes this ruling could stand correct, nor is there an authentic <b>Hadith</b> to contradict it. However, Abu Hanifah thought that the Muslim could be killed for a disbeliever, following the general meaning of the <b>Ayah</b> (5&#59;45) in Surah <b>Al-Ma'idah</b>. <br /> <br />The Four <b>Imams</b> (Abu Hanifah, Malik, Shafii and Ahmad) and the majority of scholars stated that; <br /> <br />the group is killed for one person whom they murder. <br /> <br />Umar said, about a boy who was killed by seven men, <br /> <br />&#34;If all the residents of San`a' (capital of Yemen today) collaborated on killing him, I would kill them all.&#34; <br /> <br />No opposing opinion was known by the Companions during that time which constitutes a near <b>Ijma</b> (consensus). <br /> <br />There is an opinion attributed to Imam Ahmad that; <br /> <br />a group of people is not killed for one person whom they kill, and that only one person is killed for one person. <br /> <br />Ibn Al-Mundhir also attributed this opinion to Mu`adh, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abdul-Malik bin Marwan, Az-Zuhri, Ibn Sirin and Habib bin Abu Thabit. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />... <br />فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ <br />فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br />وَأَدَاء إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ <br /> <br />But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives) of the killed (against blood money), then it should be sought in a good manner, and paid to him respectfully. <br /> <br />refers to accepting blood money (by the relatives of the victim in return for pardoning the killer) in cases of intentional murder. <br /> <br />This opinion is attributed to Abu Al-Aliyah, Abu Sha`tha', Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ata Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br />فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ <br /> (But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives) of the killed (against blood money), means, <br /> <br />&#34;the killer is pardoned by his brother (i.e., the relative of the victim) and accepting the <b>Diyah</b> after capital punishment becomes due (against the killer), this is the <b>`Afw</b> (pardon mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />... <br />فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> <br />...then it should be sought in a good manner, <br /> <br />means, when the relative agrees to take the blood money, he should collect his rightful dues with kindness&#59; <br /> <br />... <br />وَأَدَاء إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ <br /> <br />and paid to him respectfully. <br /> <br />means, the killer should accept the terms of settlement without causing further harm or resisting the payment. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />... <br />ذَلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ <br /> <br />This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. <br /> <br />means the legislation that allows you to accept the blood money for intentional murder is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. It lightens what was required from those who were before you, either applying capital punishment or forgiving. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Mansur reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Children of Israel were required to apply the Law of equality in murder cases and were not allowed to offer pardons (in return for blood money). Allah said to this <b>Ummah</b> (the Muslim nation)&#59; <br /> <br />كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالاُنثَى بِالاُنثَى <br />فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ <br /> <br />The Law of equality in punishment is prescribed for you in case of murder&#59;the free for the free, the servant for the servant, and the female for the female. But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives) of the killed (against blood money). <br /> <br />Hence, `pardoning' or `forgiving' means accepting blood money in intentional murder cases.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Hibban also recorded this in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59;<b> <br />ذَلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ <br /></b> (This is an alleviation from your Lord), <br /> <br />Allah had mercy on this <b>Ummah</b> by giving them the <b>Diyah</b> which was not allowed for any nation before it. <br /> <br />The People of the Torah (Jews) were allowed to either apply the penal code (for murder, i.e., execution) or to pardon the killer, but they were not allowed to take blood money. <br /> <br />The People of the <b>Injil</b> (the Gospel - the Christians) were required to pardon (the killer, but no <b>Diyah</b> was legislated). <br /> <br />This <b>Ummah</b> (Muslims) is allowed to apply the penal code (execution) or to pardon and accept the blood money.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ar-Rabi bin Anas. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />... <br />فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br />So after this whoever transgresses the limits, he shall have a painful torment. <br /> <br />means, those who kill in retaliation after taking the <b>Diyah</b> or accepting it, they will suffer a painful and severe torment from Allah. <br /> <br />The same was reported from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ata Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br /><b>The Benefits and Wisdom of the Law of Equality</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 177" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-177/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> البقرة<span class="num-ar">2</span> :<span class="num-ar">178</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah<span> 2</span>:<span>178</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 179" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-179/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
