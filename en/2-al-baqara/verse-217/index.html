And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever. <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Jundub bin Abdullah said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger assembled a group of men under the command of Abu Ubaydah bin Jarrah. When he was about to march, he started crying for the thought of missing Allah's Messenger. Consequently, the Messenger relieved Abu Ubaydah from command, appointed Abdullah bin Jahsh instead, gave him some written instructions and commanded him not to read the instructions until he reached such and such area. He also said to Abdullah&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تُكْرِهَنَّ أَحَدًا عَلَى السَّيْرِ مَعَكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِك <br /> <br />Do not compel any of your men to continue marching with you thereafter. <br /> <br />When Abdullah read the instructions, he recited <b>Istirja`</b> <br /> <br />(saying, `Truly! to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return'; (2&#59;156)) and said, &#34;I hear and obey Allah and His Messenger.&#34; <br /> <br />He then told his companions the story and read the instructions to them, and two men went back while the rest remained. <br /> <br />Soon after, they found Ibn Hadrami (one of the disbelievers of Quraysh) and killed him not knowing that that day was in <b>Rajab</b> or <b>Jumadi</b> (where <b>Rajab</b> is the Sacred Month). <br /> <br />The polytheists said to the Muslims, &#34;You have committed murder in the Sacred Month.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then revealed&#59; <br />يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ <br />(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, &#34;Fighting therein is a great (transgression)...&#34;). <br /> <br />Abdul-Malik bin Hisham, who compiled the <b>Sirah</b> (life story of the Prophet), related that Ziyad bin Abdullah Bakka'i said that Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar Al-Madani wrote in his book on the <b>Sirah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger sent Abdullah bin Jahsh bin Riyab Al-Asadi in <b>Rajab</b>, after he (the Prophet) came back from the first battle of <b>Badr</b>. The Prophet sent eight people with him, all from among the <b>Muhajirun</b> and none from the <b>Ansar</b>. <br /> <br />He also gave him some written instructions and ordered him not to read them until he marched for two days. Abdullah should then read the instructions and march to implement them, but should not force any of those who were with him to accompany him. <br /> <br />The companions of Abdullah bin Jahsh were all from the <b>Muhajirun</b>, <br /> <br />from the tribe of Banu Abd Shams bin Abd Manaf, there was Abu Hudhayfah bin Utbah bin Rabiah bin Abd Shams bin Abd Manaf. <br /> <br />From their allies, there was Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was the commander of the army unit, <br /> <br />and Ukkashah bin Mihsan from the tribe of Banu Asad bin Khuzaymah. <br /> <br />From the tribe of Banu Nawfal bin Abd Manaf, there was Utbah bin Ghazwan bin Jabir, one of their allies. <br /> <br />From the tribe of Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab, there was Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas. <br /> <br />From Banu Ka`b, there were their allies&#59;Adi bin Amr bin Ar-Rabiah not from the tribe of Ibn Wa'il; <br /> <br />Waqid bin Abdullah bin Abd Manaf bin Arin bin Thalabah bin Yarbu from Banu Tamim; <br /> <br />and Khalid bin Bukair from the tribe of Banu Sa`d bin Layth, <br /> <br />Suhayl bin Bayda' from Banu Al-Harith bin Fihr was also among them. <br /> <br />When Abdullah bin Jahsh marched for two days, he opened and read the (Prophet's) instructions, &#34;When you read these instructions, march until you set camp at Nakhlah between Makkah and At-Ta'if. There, watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and collect news about them for us.&#34; <br /> <br />When Abdullah bin Jahsh read the document, he said, &#34;I hear and obey.&#34; <br /> <br />He then said to his companions, &#34;Allah's Messenger has commanded me to march forth to Nakhlah to watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and to inform him about their news. He has prohibited me from forcing any of you (to go with me). So, those who seek martyrdom, they should march with me. Those who dislike the idea of martyrdom, let them turn back. Surely, I will implement the command of Allah's Messenger.&#34; <br /> <br />He and his companions continued without any of them turning back. <br /> <br />Abdullah entered the Hijaz area (western Arabia) until he reached an area called Buhran, close to Furu. There, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and Utbah bin Ghazwan lost the camel that they were riding in turns, and they went back to search for it while Abdullah bin Jahsh and the rest of his companions continued until they reached Nakhlah. <br /> <br />Then, a caravan belonging to the Quraysh passed by carrying raisins, food stuff and some trade items for the Quraysh. <br /> <br />Amr bin Hadrami, whose name was Abdullah bin Abbad, was in the caravan, as well as Uthman bin Abdullah bin Al-Mughirah and his brother Nawfal bin Abdullah from the tribe of Makhzum, and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, a freed slave of Hisham bin Al-Mughirah. When they saw the Companions they were frightened, but when they saw Ukkashah bin Mihsan their fears subsided, since his head was shaved. They said, &#34;These people seek the <b>Umrah</b>, so there is no need to fear them.&#34; <br /> <br />The Companions conferred among themselves. That day was the last day in the (sacred) month of <b>Rajab</b>. They said to each other, &#34;By Allah! If you let them pass, they will soon enter the Sacred Area and take refuge in it from you. If you kill them, you will kill them during the Sacred Month.&#34; <br /> <br />They at first hesitated and did not like to attack them. They then began encouraging themselves and decided to kill whomever they could among the disbelievers and to confiscate whatever they had. <br /> <br />Hence, Waqid bin Abdullah At-Tamimi shot an arrow at Amr bin Al-Hadrami and killed him. Uthman bin Abdullah and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan gave themselves up, while Nawfal bin Abdullah was able to outrun them in flight. <br /> <br />Later on, Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions went back to Allah's Messenger in Al-Madinah with the caravan and the two prisoners. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq went on&#59; <br /> <br />I was told that some members of the family of Abdullah bin Jahsh said that Abdullah said to his companions&#59;&#34;Allah's Messenger will have one-fifth of what we have confiscated.&#34; <br /> <br />This occurred before Allah required one-fifth for His Messenger from the war booty. So, Abdullah designated one-fifth of the caravan for Allah's Messenger and divided the rest among his companions. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq also stated that at first, when the Sariyah came back to Allah's Messenger, he said to them&#59; <br /> <br />مَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِقِتَالٍ فِي الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَام <br /> <br />I have not commanded you to conduct warfare during the Sacred Month. <br /> <br />He left the caravan and the two prisoners alone and did not take any share of the war booty. <br /> <br />When Allah's Messenger did that, the soldiers from the attack were concerned and felt that they were destroyed, and their Muslim brethren criticized them for what they did. <br /> <br />The Quraysh said that Muhammad and his Companions violated the sanctity of the Sacred Month and shed blood, confiscated property and took prisoners during it. Those who refuted them among the Muslims who remained in Makkah replied that the Muslims had done that during the month of <b>Shaban</b> (which is not a sacred month). <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Jews were pleased about what happened to Allah's Messenger. They said, `Amr bin Hadrami was killed by Waqid bin Abdullah&#59; <br /> <br />`<b>Amr</b>, means the war has started, <b>Hadrami</b> means the war has come, as for <b>Waqid</b> (bin Abdullah)&#59;the war has raged (using some of the literal meanings of these names to support their fortune-telling!).&#34; <br /> <br />But, Allah made all that turn against them. <br /> <br />The people continued talking about this matter, then Allah revealed to His Messenger&#59; <br /> <br />يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللّهِ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْل <br /> <br />They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. <br /> <br />Say, &#34;Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> (at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and <b>Al-Fitnah</b> is worse than killing. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />`If you had killed during the Sacred Month, they (disbelievers of Quraysh) have hindered you from the path of Allah and disbelieved in it. They also prevented you from entering the Sacred Mosque, and expelled you from it, while you are its people, <br />أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللّهِ <br /> (...a greater (transgression) with Allah) than killing whom you killed among them. Also&#59; <br />وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْل<b>...</b> (...and <b>Al-Fitnah</b> is worse than killing) means, trying to force the Muslims to revert from their religion and re-embrace <b>Kufr</b> after they had believed, is worse with Allah than killing.' <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىَ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعُواْ <br /> <br />And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic Monotheism) if they can. <br /> <br />So, they will go on fighting you with unrelenting viciousness. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq went on&#59; <br /> <br />When the Qur'an touched this subject and Allah brought relief to the Muslims instead of the sadness that had befallen them, Allah's Messenger took possession of the caravan and the two prisoners. <br /> <br />The Quraysh offered to ransom the two prisoners, Uthman bin Abdullah and Hakam bin Kaysan. <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا نَفْدِيكُمُوهُمَا حَتَّى يَقْدَمَ صَاحِبَانَا <br /> <br />We will not accept your ransom until our two companions return safely. <br /> <br />meaning Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and Utbah bin Ghazwan, &#34;For we fear for their safety with you. If you kill them, we will kill your people.&#34; <br /> <br />Later on, Sa`d and Utbah returned safely and Allah's Messenger accepted the Quraysh's ransom for their prisoners. <br /> <br />As for Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, he became Muslim and his Islam strengthened. He remained with Allah's Messenger until he was martyred during the incident at Bir Ma`unah (when the Prophet sent seventy Companions to Najd to teach them Islam, but Banu Sulaim killed them all except two). <br /> <br />As for Uthman bin Abdullah, he went back to Makkah and died there as a disbeliever. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq went on&#59; <br /> <br />When Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions were relieved from their depressing thoughts after the Qur'an was revealed about this subject, they sought the reward of the fighters (in Allah's way). They said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! We wish that this incident be considered a battle for us, so that we gain the rewards of the Mujahidin.&#34; <br /> <br />Then, Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ أُوْلَـيِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ اللّهِ وَاللّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>Thus the Prophet (s) sent forth the first of his raiding parties under the command of `Abd Allh b. Jahsh. They fought against the idolaters and killed [`Amr b. `Abd Allh] Ibn al-Hadram in [the sacred month of] Rajab, thinking that it was the last day of Jumd II. The disbelievers reviled them for making fighting lawful in a sacred month, and so God revealed the following&#59; They ask you about the sacred, the forbidden, month, and fighting in it (qitlin fhi, `fighting in it', is an inclusive substitution [for al-shahri l-harmi, `the sacred month']). Say, to them&#59; `Fighting (qitlun is the subject) in it is a grave thing (kabr, `grave', is the predicate), that is, heinous in terms of sin; but to bar (saddun is the subject), people, from God's way, His religion, and disbelief in Him, in God, and, to bar from, the Sacred Mosque, that is, Mecca, and to expel its people, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from it -- that is graver (the predicate of the [last] subject), [that is] more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it, in God's sight; and sedition, your idolatry, is graver than, your, slaying', in it. They, the disbelievers, will not cease to fight against you, O believers, until, so that, they turn you from your religion, to unbelief, if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving -- their, good, works have failed, that is, they are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not result in any reward. The specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return to Islam [again], his original deeds would not be invalidated, and he will be rewarded for them, and he would not have to repeat them, [deeds] such as [performing] the Pilgrimage&#59; al-Shfi` is of this opinion. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say&#59; &#34;Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members.&#34; Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 216" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-216/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> البقرة <span class="num-ar">2</span> : <span class="num-ar">217</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Baqarah <span>2</span>:<span>217</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Alif Lam Mim</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Baqara Verse 218" href="/en/2-al-baqara/verse-218/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
