Allah the Exalted has complete knowledge of all thoughts that cross the mind of man, be they good or evil. <br /> <br />In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى تَجَاوَزَ لاُِمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل <br /> <br />Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my <b>Ummah</b> (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it. <br /> <br />The statement of Allah the Exalted, <br /> <br />وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. <br /> <br />means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. <br /> <br />Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said, <br />وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ <br /> (And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein). just as He said in the case of dying persons, <b> <br />وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ <br /></b> (But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not). (56&#59;85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted the Blessed said, <br />إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ <br /> Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the <b>Dhikr</b> and surely, We will guard it. (15&#59;9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet, who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. <br /> <br />Allah's statement here</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Qaf Verse 15" href="/en/50-qaf/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> ق<span class="num-ar">50</span> :<span class="num-ar">16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Qaf<span> 50</span>:<span>16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Basiqat</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Qaf Verse 17" href="/en/50-qaf/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
