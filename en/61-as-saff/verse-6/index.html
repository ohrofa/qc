He is the unlettered, <b>Makkan</b>, Arab Prophet and Messenger, <b>Ahmad</b>.&#34; <br /><b>`Isa</b>, peace be upon him, is the last and final Messenger from among the Children of Israel. He remained among the Children of Israel for a while, conveying the good news of the coming of <b>Muhammad</b>, whose name is also <b>Ahmad</b>, the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger. After <b>Muhammad</b>, there will be no Prophethood or Messengers. <br /> <br />How admirable the Hadith is that Al-Bukhari collected in his Sahih from Jubayr bin Mut`im, who said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard the Messenger of Allah say, <br /> <br />إِنَّ لِي أَسْمَاءً أَنَا مُحَمَّدٌ وَأَنَا أَحْمَدُ وَأَنَا الْمَاحِي الَّذِي يَمْحُو اللهُ بِهِ الْكُفْرَ وَأَنَا الْحَاشِرُ الَّذِي يُحْشَرُ النَّاسُ عَلَى قَدَمَيَّ وَأَنَا الْعَاقِب <br /> <br />I have names. <br /> <br />- I am <b>Muhammad</b> and <b>Ahmad</b>. <br /> <br />- I am <b>Al-Mahi</b> through whom Allah will eliminate disbelief. <br /> <br />- I am <b>Al-Hashir</b> who will be the first to be resurrected, with the people being resurrected Hereafter. <br /> <br />- I am also <b>Al-`Aqib</b> (i.e., there will be no Prophet after me).&#34; <br /> <br />Also Muslim collected this Hadith from Az-Zuhri from Jubayr. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan said that some Companions of Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! Tell us about yourself.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي حِينَ حَمَلَتْ بِي كَأَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْها نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ بُصْرَى مِنْ أَرْضِ الشَّام <br /> <br />I am the (result of the) invocation made to Allah from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa delivered. When my mother was pregnant with me, she had a dream in which she saw a light emanating from her that radiated the palaces of Basra in Ash-Sham.&#34; <br /> <br />This Hadith has a good chain of narration that is supported by other similar narrations. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-`Irbad bin Sariyah said, &#34;The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنِّي عِنْدَ اللهِ لَخَاتَمُ النَّبِيِّينَ وَإِنَّ ادَمَ لَمُنْجَدِلٌ فِي طِينَتِهِ وَسَأُنَبِّيُكُمْ بِأَوَّلِ ذَلِكَ دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَبِشَارَةُ عِيسَى بِي وَرُوْيَا أُمِّي الَّتِي رَأَتْ وَكَذَلِكَ أُمَّهَاتُ النَّبِيِّينَ يَرَيْن <br /> <br />I was written with Allah as the Last and Final of the Prophet, even when Adam was still clay. I will tell of the first good news announcing my advent, the (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim, the good news `Isa conveyed, and the dream that my mother saw. The mothers of all Prophets see similar dreams.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I said, `O Allah's Messenger! What was the first good news of your coming?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام <br /> <br />The (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa conveyed. My mother saw a light emanating from her that filled the palaces of Ash-Sham in a dream.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that&#59; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah sent eighty men, including Abdullah bin Masud, Jafar bin Abi Talib, Abdullah bin Urfutah, Uthman bin Mazun, Abu Musa, and others, to An-Najashi. <br /> <br />The Quraysh sent Amr bin Al-`As and Umarah bin Al-Walid with a gift for An-Najashi. When they, Amr and `Umarah, came to An-Najashi, they prostrated before him and stood to his right and left. Amr and Umarah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some of our cousins migrated to your land; they have abandoned us and our religion.&#34; <br /> <br />An-Najashi said, &#34;Where are they&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;They are in your land, so send for them,&#34; so An-Najashi summoned the Muslims. <br /> <br />Jafar said to the Muslims, &#34;I will be your speaker today.&#34; So, the Muslims followed Jafar and when he entered on the king he did not prostrate after greeting him. <br /> <br />They said to Jafar, &#34;Why do you not prostrate before the king'?' <br /> <br />Jafar said, &#34;We only prostrate for Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Why?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah has sent a Messenger to us from Him, who ordered us not to prostrate to anyone except Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He also ordered to perform prayer and give charity.&#34; <br /> <br />Amr bin Al-`As said, &#34;They contradict your creed about `Isa, son of Maryam.&#34; <br /> <br />The king asked, &#34;What do you say about `Isa and his mother Maryam?&#34; <br /> <br />Ja`far said, <br /> <br />&#34;We only say what Allah said about him, that he is Allah's Word, a soul created by Allah and sent down to the honorable virgin who was not touched by a man nor bearing children before.&#34; <br /> <br />An-Najashi lifted a straw of wood and said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Ethiopians, monks and priests! By Allah, what they say about `Isa is no more than what we say about him, not even a difference that equals this straw. You are welcomed among us, and greetings to him who sent you. I bear witness that he is Allah's Messenger whom we read about in the <b>Injil</b>. He is the Prophet who `Isa, son of Maryam, foretold the good news about his advent. Live wherever you wish. By Allah, had I not been entrusted with the responsibilities of kingship, I would have gone to him, so that I could be honored by carrying his slippers and his water for ablution.&#34; <br /> <br />The king ordered that the gifts of the idolators be returned to them. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud soon returned and later on participated in the battle of <b>Badr</b>. He said that when the Prophet received the news that An-Najashi died, he invoked Allah to forgive him. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاءهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ قَالُوا هَذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said&#59;&#34;This is plain magic.&#34; <br /> <br />this refers to <b>Ahmad</b>, who was anticipated, in accordance with the early Scriptures and early generations, according to Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />When the Prophet appeared bringing clear signs, the disbelievers and rejecters said, <br />هَذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ <br /> (This is plain magic).</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah As-Saff Verse 5" href="/en/61-as-saff/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الصف<span class="num-ar">61</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">As-Saff<span> 61</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Hawariyoon, Esa</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah As-Saff Verse 7" href="/en/61-as-saff/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
