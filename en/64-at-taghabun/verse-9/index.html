This is the Day when the earlier and later generations will all be gathered in one area, a caller would be heard by them all, and one's vision would easily see them all. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّجْمُوعٌ لَّهُ النَّاسُ وَذَلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّشْهُودٌ <br /> <br />That is the Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, that is a Day when all will be present. (11&#59;103) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَالاٌّخِرِينَ <br /> <br />لَمَجْمُوعُونَ إِلَى مِيقَـتِ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ <br /> <br />Say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;(Yes) verily, those of old, and those of later times. All will surely be gathered together for appointed meeting of a known Day.&#34; (56&#59;49-50) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ <br /> <br />that will be the Day of <b>At-Taghabun</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn `Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, and that is because the people of Paradise will have gained over the people of the Fire.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah and Mujahid said similarly. <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br /> <br />&#34;There is no mutual loss and gain greater than these entering Paradise and those being taken to the Fire.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah explained His statement saying; <br /> <br />وَمَن يُوْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّيَاتِهِ <br /> <br />وَيُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاَْنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِأيَاتِنَا أُوْلَيِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَبِيْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Taghabun Verse 8" href="/en/64-at-taghabun/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التغابن<span class="num-ar">64</span> :<span class="num-ar">9</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tagabun<span> 64</span>:<span>9</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Taghabun Verse 10" href="/en/64-at-taghabun/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
