Do not utter a statement or make a decision before Allah and His Messenger issue a statement or decision. Do not ignore what you were ordered to do, nor commit what you were forbidden from doing. <br /><b>Encouraging Charity</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />وَأَنفِقُوا خَيْرًا لاَِّنفُسِكُمْ <br /> <br />and spend in charity; that is better for yourselves. <br /> <br />meaning, give from what Allah has granted you to your relatives, the poor, the needy and the weak. Be kind to Allah's creatures, just as Allah was and still is kind with you. This will be better for you in this life and the Hereafter. Otherwise, if you do not do it, it will be worse for you in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And whosoever is saved from his own greed, then they are the successful ones. <br /> <br />This was explained with a similar Ayah in Surah <b>Al-Hashr</b>, where we also mentioned the relevant Hadiths. Therefore, we do not need to repeat them here, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Taghabun Verse 15" href="/en/64-at-taghabun/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التغابن<span class="num-ar">64</span> :<span class="num-ar">16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tagabun<span> 64</span>:<span>16</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Taghabun Verse 17" href="/en/64-at-taghabun/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
