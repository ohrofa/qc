Let us get something from your light!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah informs us in this Ayah of the terrible horrors, horrendous incidents and tremendous events that will take place on the Day of Resurrection in the Gathering Area. No one will be saved on that Day, except those who believed in Allah and His Messenger, obeyed Allah's commands and avoided His prohibitions. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi, Ad-Dahhak and others reported from Ibn Abbas&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When the people are gathering in darkness, Allah will send light, and when the believers see the light they will march towards it. This light will be their guide from Allah to Paradise. When the hypocrites see the believers following the light, they will follow them. However, Allah will extinguish the light for the hypocrites and they will say (to the believers), <br />انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ <br /> (Wait for us! Let us get something from your light). The believers will reply ( <br />قِيلَ <br />) by saying, <br />ارْجِعُوا وَرَاءكُمْ <br /> (Go back to your rear!) to the dark area you were in, and <br />فَالْتَمِسُوا نُورًا <br /> (Then seek a light!) look for a light there!&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُ بَابٌ بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ وَظَاهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So, a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan and Qatadah said that the wall mentioned here is located between Paradise and Hellfire. <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that the wall mentioned in this Ayah is the wall that Allah described in His statement, <br /> <br />وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ <br /> <br />And between them will be a (barrier) screen. (7&#59;46) <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Mujahid and others, and it is correct. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ <br /> (Inside it will be mercy), meaning, Paradise and all that is in it, <br /> <br />وَظَاهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ <br /> (and outside it will be torment). meaning, the Hellfire, <br /> <br />This is according to Qatadah, Ibn Zayd and others. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 12" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحديد<span class="num-ar">57</span> :<span class="num-ar">13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hadid<span> 57</span>:<span>13</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 14" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
