And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah. But they did not observe it with due observance. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A.

And We set in the hearts of those who followed him tenderness and mercy. And monasticism they invented -- We did not prescribe it for them -- only seeking the good pleasure of God; but they observed it not as it should be observed. So We gave those of them who believed their wage; and many of them are ungodly.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>We sent other messengers to follow in their footsteps. After those We sent Jesus, son of Mary: We gave him the Gospel and put compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. But monasticism was something they invented- We did not ordain it for them- only to seek God’s pleasure, and even so, they did not observe it properly. So We gave a reward to those of them who believed, but many of them were lawbreakers.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Thereafter in their footsteps We caused Our apostles to follow, and We caused lsa, son Of Maryam, to follow them, and We vouchsafed Unto him the Injil, and We placed In the hearts of those who followed him tenderness and mercy. And asceticism! they innovated it- We prescribed it not for them Only seeking Allah's pleasure yet they tended it not with tendence due thereto. So We vouchsafed Unto such of them as believed their hire, and many of them are transgressors.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers&#59; We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them&#59; (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>In their wake, We sent a succession of Our Messengers, and raised Jesus, son of Mary, after all of them, and bestowed upon him the Evangel, and We set tenderness and mercy in the hearts of those that followed him. As for monasticism, it is they who invented it; We did not prescribe it for them. They themselves invented it in pursuit of Allah's good pleasure, and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed. So We gave their reward to those of them that believed. But many of them are wicked.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Then in their train We sent Our apostles, and succeeding them Jesus, son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel, and put into the hearts of his followers compassion and kindness.

But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance. So We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</p></div><div id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><h3><span>15</span> Maulana Mohammad Ali</h3><p>And certainly We sent Noah and Abraham, and We gave prophethood and the Book to their offspring; so among them is he who goes aright, but most of them are transgressors.</p></div><div id="shakir"><h3><span>16</span> Mohammad Habib Shakir</h3><p>Then We made Our apostles to follow in their footsteps, and We sent Isa son of Marium afterwards, and We gave him the Injeel, and We put in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy; and (as for) monkery, they innovated it-- We did not prescribe it to them-- only to seek Allah's pleasure, but they did not observe it with its due observance; so We gave to those of them who believed their reward, and most of them are transgressors.</p></div><div id="pickthall"><h3><span>17</span> Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</h3><p>Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him.

As for monasticism, they invented it thereby seeking the pleasure of Allah. We did not write it for them, and they did not observe it as it should be observed. We gave to those of them who believed their wage, but many of them are impious.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent `Isa the son of Maryam, and gave him the Injil. And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance. So, We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward; but many of them are rebellious.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>Then, in their wake, We followed them up with [others of] Our messengers and after them Jesus, son of Mary. We gave him the Gospel and imbued the hearts of those who followed him with compassion and mercy. But We did not prescribe monasticism for them: that was their own innovation by which they sought to please God. But then, they did not observe it in the way that it should have been observed. So We rewarded only those who were truly faithful, for many of them were disobedient.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>Then We sent in their wake Our messengers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy. But as for the monasticism which they invented—We did not ordain it for them—only to seek God’s approval. But they did not observe it with its due observance. So We gave those of them who believed their reward, but many of them are sinful.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Then We sent to follow in their footsteps Our messengers, and We sent to follow, Jesus son of Mary, and We gave him the Gospel, and We placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy. But [as for] monasticism, namely, abstention from women and seclusion in monasteries, they invented it, [an innovation] on their part -- We had not prescribed it for them, We did not enjoin them to it; but they took it on -- only seeking God's beatitude. Yet they did not observe it with due observance, for many of them abandoned it and rejected the religion of Jesus and embraced the religion of their [then] king. However, many of them did remain upon the religion of Jesus and they believed in our Prophet [when he came]. So We gave those of them who believed, in him, their reward; but many of them are immoral.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>ثُمَّ قَفَّيْنَا عَلَى اثَارِهِم بِرُسُلِنَا وَقَفَّيْنَا بِعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَاتَيْنَاهُ الاِْنجِيلَ <br /> <br />Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent 'Isa the son of Maryam, and gave him the <b>Injil</b>. <br /> <br />referring to the <b>Injil</b> that Allah revealed to him, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا فِي قُلُوبِ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ <br /> <br />And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, i.e., the disciples, <br /> <br />رَأْفَةً <br /> <br />compassion (and tenderness), <br /> <br />وَرَحْمَةً <br /> <br />and mercy. (toward the creatures). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ابْتَدَعُوهَا <br /> <br />But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, <br /> <br />refers to the monasticism that the Christian nation invented, <br /> <br />مَا كَتَبْنَاهَا عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />We did not prescribe for them, <br /> <br />`We -- Allah -- did not ordain it for them, but they chose it on their own.' <br /> <br />There are two opinions about the meaning of, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ ابْتِغَاء رِضْوَانِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />only to please Allah therewith, <br /> <br />- The first is that they wanted to please Allah by inventing monasticism. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah said this. <br /> <br />- The second meaning is&#59;&#34;We did not ordain them to practice that but, rather, We ordained them only to seek what pleases Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا <br /> <br />but that they did not observe it with the right observance. <br /> <br />meaning, they did not abide by what they ordered themselves to do. <br /> <br />This Ayah criticizes them in two ways&#59; <br /> <br />- first, they invented in things in their religion, things which Allah did not legislate for them. <br /> <br />- The second is that they did not fulfill the requirements of what they themselves invented and which they claimed was a means of drawing near to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i -- and this is his wording - recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;There were kings after `Isa who changed the <b>Tawrah</b> and the <b>Injil</b> when there were still believers who recited <b>Tawrah</b> and the <b>Injil</b>. Their kings were told, <br /> <br />`We were never confronted by more severe criticism and abuse than of these people.' -- <br /> <br />they recite the Ayah, <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَأ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَـفِرُونَ <br /> <br />And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers. (5&#59;44), <br /> <br />as well as, they accuse us of short comings in our actions, while still they recite. Therefore, summon them and let them recite these Ayat our way and believe in them our way.' <br /> <br />The king summoned them and gathered them and threatened them with death if they did not revert from reciting the original <b>Tawrah</b> and <b>Injil</b> to using the corrupted version only. <br /> <br />They said, <br /> <br />`Why do you want us to do that, let us be.' <br /> <br />Some of them said, <br /> <br />`Build a narrow elevated tower for us and let us ascend it, and then give us the means to elevate food and drink to us. This way, you will save yourselves from hearing us.' <br /> <br />Another group among them said, <br /> <br />`Let us go about in the land and eat and drink like beasts do, and if you find us in your own land, then kill us.' <br /> <br />Another group among them said, <br /> <br />`Build homes (monasteries) for us in the deserts and secluded areas, where we can dig wells and plant vegetables. Then, we will not refute you and will not even pass by you.' <br /> <br />These groups said this, even though they all had supporters among their tribes. It is about this that Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah, <br /> <br />وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ابْتَدَعُوهَا مَا كَتَبْنَاهَا عَلَيْهِمْ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَاء رِضْوَانِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا <br /> <br />(But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.) &#34;' <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />فَأتَيْنَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So, We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward; but many of them are rebellious. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لِكُلِّ نَبِيَ رَهْبَانِيَّةٌ وَرَهْبَانِيَّةُ هذِهِ الاُْمَّةِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />Every Prophet has <b>Rahbaniyyah</b> (monasticism); <b>Jihad</b> in the cause of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, is the <b>Rahbaniyyah</b> of this <b>Ummah</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la collected this Hadith and in this narration, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَهْبَانِيَّةٌ وَرَهْبَانِيَّةُ هذِهِ الاُْمَّةِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله <br /> <br />Every <b>Ummah</b> has <b>Rahbaniyyah</b>; <b>Jihad</b> in the cause of Allah is the <b>Rahbaniyyah</b> of this <b>Ummah</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that a man came to him and asked him for advice, and Abu Sa`id said that he asked the same of Allah's Messenger. Abu Sa`id said, <br /> <br />&#34;So, I advise you to <br /> <br />- adhere by the <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, because it is the chief of all matters. <br /> <br />- Fulfill the obligation of <b>Jihad</b>, because it is the <b>Rahbaniyyah</b> of Islam. <br /> <br />- Take care of remembering Allah and reciting the Qur'an, because it is your closeness (or status) in the heavens and your good fame on earth.&#34; <br /> <br />Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 26" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحديد<span class="num-ar">57</span> :<span class="num-ar">27</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hadid<span> 57</span>:<span>27</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 28" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
