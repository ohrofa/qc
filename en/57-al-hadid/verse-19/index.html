They shall have their reward and their light). <br /> <br />Abu Ad-Duha (stopped after he) recited, <br />أُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ <br /> (they are the <b>Siddiqun</b>), then initiated recitation&#59; <br />وَالشُّهَدَاء عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ <br /> (and the martyrs (are) with their Lord). <br /> <br />Masruq, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others said similarly. <br /> <br />Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Ad-Duha from Masruq from Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on Allah's statement, <br />وْلَيِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ<b> <br />وَالشُّهَدَاء عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ <br /></b> (they are the <b>Siddiqun</b>, and the martyrs with their Lord), <br /> <br />&#34;They are of three categories,&#34; meaning <br /> <br />- there are those who spend in charity, <br /> <br />- the <b>Siddiqun</b> and <br /> <br />- the martyrs. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّـلِحِينَ <br /> <br />And whoso obey Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the <b>Siddiqin</b>, the martyrs, and the righteous. (4&#59;69) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah made a distinction between the <b>Siddiqin</b> and the martyrs, indicating that they are of two distinct categories, so there is no doubt that <b>Siddiq</b> is a better status than the martyr. <br /> <br />Imam Malik bin Anas recorded in his Muwatta' that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ لَيَتَرَاءَوْنَ أَهْلَ الْغُرَفِ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ كَمَا تَتَرَاءَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الدُّرِّيَّ الْغَابِرَ فِي الاُْفُقِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ أَوِ الْمَغْرِبِ لِتَفَاضُلِ مَا بَيْنَهُم <br /> <br />The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of the lofty mansions as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the east or in the west on the horizon, because of their superiority over one another. <br /> <br />On that the people said, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! Are these lofty mansions for the Prophets whom none else can reach&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet replied, <br /> <br />بَلَى وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ رِجَالٌ امَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين <br /> <br />No! By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! these are for men who believe in Allah and believe in the Messengers. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَالشُّهَدَاء عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ <br /> <br />and the martyrs with their Lord. <br /> <br />means that they will be in the gardens of Paradise, as recorded in the Sahih&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طَيْرٍ خُضْرٍ تَسْرَحُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى تِلْكَ الْقَنَادِيلِ فَاطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّكَ اطِّلَعَةً فَقَالَ مَاذَا تُرِيدُونَ فَقَالُوا نُحِبُّ أَنْ تَرُدَّنَا إِلَى الدَّارِ الدُّنْيَا فَنُقَاتِلَ فِيكَ فَنُقْتَلَ كَمَا قُتِلْنَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَقَالَ إِنِّي قَدْ قَضَيْتُ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهَا لَا يَرْجِعُون <br /> <br />The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds, who fly wherever they wish in Paradise and then return to their nests in chandeliers. Once your Lord cast a glance at them and said, <br /> <br />`Do you want anything&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;We wish that You return us to the life of the world, so that we may fight in Your cause and be killed as we were killed the first time.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, &#34;I have decreed that they shall not be returned to it again.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ <br /> <br />They shall have their reward and their light, <br /> <br />means that Allah will grant them a generous reward and a tremendous light that will precede before them. In this, the believers vary regarding the level of reward they receive, according to their good actions in the life of this world. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Umar bin Al-Khattab said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, <br /> <br />الشُّهَدَاءُ أَرْبَعَةٌ <br /> <br />رَجُلٌ مُوْمِنٌ جَيِّدُ الاِْيمَانِ لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ فَقُتِلَ فَذَاكَ الَّذِي يَنْظُرُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهِ هكَذَا <br /> <br />There are four ranks of martyrs. <br /> <br />- The first is a man who believes and who is true in faith, who meets the enemy (in battle), fulfills his duty to Allah and is killed. This is the type that the people will look up to (his level in Paradise), like this. <br /> <br />The Prophet raised his head until his cap fell off his head, and the same happened to Umar. <br /> <br />The Prophet continued, <br /> <br />وَالثَّانِي مُوْمِنٌ لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَكَأَنَّمَا يُضْرَبُ ظَهْرُهُ بِشَوْكِ الطَّلْحِ جَاءَهُ سَهْمٌ غَرْبٌ فَقَتَلَهُ فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّانِيَةِ <br /> <br />وَالثَّالِثُ رَجُلٌ مُوْمِنٌ خَلَطَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَاخَرَ سَيِّيًا لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّالِثَةِ <br /> <br />وَالرَّابِعُ رَجُلٌ مُوْمِنٌ أَسْرَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ إِسْرَافًا كَثِيرًا لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الرَّابِعَة <br /> <br />- The second is a believer who meets the enemy and is struck by a stray arrow which causes him to die. This believer is in the second grade. <br /> <br />- The third is a believer who has combined good deeds with evil deeds; he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah until he is killed. This is the third category. <br /> <br />- And the fourth is a believer who has committed sins excessively, so he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah, and is killed. This is the fourth category. <br /> <br />`Ali bin Al-Madini also reported this Hadith and said, &#34;This Egyptian chain is Salih useful.&#34; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِأيَاتِنَا أُوْلَيِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat -- they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire. <br /> <br />mentions the destination and the condition of the miserable ones, after Allah mentioned the destination and rewards of the happy ones</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 18" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحديد<span class="num-ar">57</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hadid<span> 57</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 20" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
