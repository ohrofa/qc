However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and that free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />أَفَلَ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِذَا فَعَلْتُمُوهُ سَبَقْتُمْ مَنْ بَعْدَكُمْ وَلَا يَكُونُ أَحَدٌ أَفْضَلَ مِنْكُمْ إِلاَّ مَنْ صَنَعَ مِثْلَ مَا صَنَعْتُمْ <br /> <br />تُسَبِّحُونَ <br /> <br />وَتُكَبِّرُونَ <br /> <br />وَتُحَمِّدُونَ <br /> <br />دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلَةٍ ثَلَثًا وَثَلَثِين <br /> <br />Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you, none would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same.
