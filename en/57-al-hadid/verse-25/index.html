(30&#59;30) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَالسَّمَأءَ رَفَعَهَا وَوَضَعَ الْمِيزَانَ <br /> <br />And the heaven&#59;He has raised it high, and He has set up the <b>Mizan</b>. (55&#59;7) <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br /> <br />لِيَقُومَ النَّاسُ بِالْقِسْطِ <br /> <br />that mankind may keep up justice, <br /> <br />truth and fairness that is found in the obedience of the Messengers, in all that they conveyed from their Lord, and following all they commanded. Surely, what the Prophets brought forth is the truth, beyond which there is no truth, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً <br /> <br />And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. (6&#59;115), <br /> <br />His Word is true in what it conveys, and just in all its orders and prohibitions. This is why the believers say, when they take up their rooms in Paradise and assume their high grades and lined thrones, <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى هَدَانَا لِهَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ لَقَدْ جَأءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ <br /> <br />All praise is due to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth. (7&#59;43) <br /><b>The Benefits of Iron</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَنزَلْنَا الْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power, as well as many benefits for mankind, <br /> <br />meaning, `We made iron a deterrent for those who refuse the truth and oppose it after the proof has been established against them.' <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger remained in Makkah for thirteen years. During that time, the revelation continued being sent to him, containing arguments against the idolators and explaining <b>Tawhid</b> with detail and proofs. When the evidence was established against those who defied the Messenger, Allah decreed the <b>Hijrah</b>. Then He ordered the believers to fight the disbelievers using swords, using them to strike the necks and foreheads of those who opposed, rejected and denied the Qur'an. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded that Abdullah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />بُعِثْتُ بِالسَّيْفِ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ السَّاعَةِ حَتْى يُعْبَدَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَجُعِلَ رِزْقِي تَحْتَ ظِلِّ رُمْحِي وَجُعِلَ الذِّلَّةُ والصَّغَارُ عَلَى مَنْ خَالَفَ أَمْرِي وَمَنْ تَشَبَّهَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُم <br /> <br />I was sent with the sword just before the Hour so that Allah be worshipped alone without partners. My provision was placed under the shadow of my spear, and those who defy my order were disgraced and humiliated, and he who imitates a people is one of them. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Exalted said, <br />فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ <br /> (wherein is mighty power), in reference to weapons, such as swords, spears, daggers, arrows, shields, and so forth, <br />وَمَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ <br /> (as well as many benefits for mankind), meaning, in their livelihood, such as using it to make coins, hammers, axes, saws chisels, shovels and various tools that people use for tilting the land, sowing, cooking, making dough and manufacturing other objects necessary for their livelihood. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ وَرُسُلَهُ بِالْغَيْبِ <br /> <br />that Allah may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen. <br /> <br />meaning, whose intention by carrying weapons is the defense of Allah (His religion) and His Messenger, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is Powerful, Almighty. <br /> <br />meaning, surely, Allah is Powerful, Almighty, and He gives victory to those who give victory and aid to Him. However, Allah does not need mankind's help, but He ordered <b>Jihad</b> to test people with each other.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 24" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحديد<span class="num-ar">57</span> :<span class="num-ar">25</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hadid<span> 57</span>:<span>25</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hadid Verse 26" href="/en/57-al-hadid/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=57,sura_dir="al-hadid",count_ayat=29,number_aya=25;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
