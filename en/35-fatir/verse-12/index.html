The fresh, palatable sea (kind of water) refers to the rivers which flow among people, rivers great and small according to people's needs in all regions and areas and lands. This water is sweet and palatable for whoever wants to drink it. <br /> <br />وَهَذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ <br /> <br />and that is salty and bitter. <br /> <br />means, unpalatable. <br /> <br />This is the ocean in which the big ships sail, and is salty and undrinkable. <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمِن كُلٍّ تَأْكُلُونَ لَحْمًا طَرِيًّا <br /> <br />And from them both you eat fresh tender meat, <br /> <br />meaning, fish. <br /> <br />وَتَسْتَخْرِجُونَ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا <br /> <br />and derive the ornaments that you wear. <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلوْلُوُ وَالمَرْجَانُ <br /> <br />فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ <br /> <br />Out of them both come out pearl and coral. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both (Jinn and men) deny! (55&#59;22-23) <br /> <br />وَتَرَى الْفُلْكَ فِيهِ مَوَاخِرَ <br /> <br />And you see the ships cleaving, <br /> <br />means, they travel through it, plowing through the water with their beak-shaped bows. <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />The wind drives the ships, and the wind cannot drive any ships except the big ones. <br /> <br />لِتَبْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> <br />that you may seek of His bounty, <br /> <br />means, through your journeys to engage in trade from one land to another. <br /> <br />وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and that you may give thanks. <br /> <br />means, that you may give thanks to your Lord for subjugating this mighty creation -- the sea -- to you, so that you can travel through it as you wish and go wherever you want, and nothing stops you؛ His power has subjugated for you whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and all of this is by His grace and mercy</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Fatir Verse 11" href="/en/35-fatir/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> فاطر<span class="num-ar">35</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Fatir<span> 35</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Mala'ika</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Fatir Verse 13" href="/en/35-fatir/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
