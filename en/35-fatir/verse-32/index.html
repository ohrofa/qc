They are this <b>Ummah</b>, who are divided into three types.' <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ <br /> <br />Then of them are some who wrong themselves, <br /> <br />these are the ones who are careless about doing some obligatory actions, and who commit some forbidden actions. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ <br /> <br />and of them are some who follow a middle course, <br /> <br />these are the ones who fulfill their obligations and avoid things that are forbidden, but they may neglect some good deeds and do some things which are disliked. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds. <br /> <br />these are the ones who do obligatory actions and things which are encouraged, and who avoid doing unlawful and disliked actions, and avoid some actions which are permissible. <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ <br /> <br /> <br />that is indeed a great grace. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا <br /> (Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose). <br /> <br />&#34;This refers to the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad. Allah caused it to inherit every Book that He had revealed; those who wrong themselves will be forgiven, those who follow a middle course will have an easy accounting, and those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani reported from Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said one day&#59; <br /> <br />شَفَاعَتِي لاَِهْلِ الْكَبَايِرِ مِنْ أُمَّتِي <br /> <br />My intercession will be for those among my <b>Ummah</b> who commit major sins.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, <br /> <br />&#34;Those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account; <br /> <br />those who follow a middle course will enter Paradise by the mercy of Allah; and <br /> <br />those who wrong themselves and <b>Ashab Al-A`raf</b> will enter Paradise by the intercession of Muhammad.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also reported from a number of the <b>Salaf</b> that those among this <b>Ummah</b> who wrong themselves are still among those whom Allah has chosen, even though they are imperfect and fell short (by not adhering to the straight path). <br /> <br />Others said that those who wrong themselves are not part of this <b>Ummah</b> and are not among those whom Allah has chosen and who inherited the Book. <br /> <br />The correct view is that they are also part of this <b>Ummah</b>. <br /><b>The Virtues of the Scholars</b> <br /> <br />The scholars are the most fortunate of people with regard to this blessing, and the most entitled to this mercy. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Qays bin Kathir said, <br /> <br />&#34;One of the people of Al-Madinah came to Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, when he was in Damascus. (Abu Ad-Darda') said, `What brought you here, my brother?' <br /> <br />He said, `A <b>Hadith</b> which I heard that you narrate from the Messenger of Allah.' <br /> <br />He said, `Have you come for trade?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />He said, `Have you come for any other reason?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />He said, `Have you come only to seek this <b>Hadith</b>?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />He, may Allah be pleased with him said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَطْلُبُ فِيهَا عِلْمًا سَلَكَ اللهُ تَعَالَى بِهِ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِنَّ الْمَلَيِكَةَ لَتَضَعُ أَجْنِحَتَهَا رِضًا لِطَالِبِ الْعِلْمِ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَسْتَغْفِرُ لِلْعَالِمِ مَنْ فِي السَّمَوَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ حَتَّى الْحِيتَانُ فِي الْمَاءِ وَفَضْلُ الْعَالِمِ عَلَى الْعَابِدِ كَفَضْلِ الْقَمَرِ عَلَى سَايِرِ الْكَوَاكِبِ وَإِنَّ الْعُلَمَاءَ هُمْ وَرَثَةُ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ وَإِنَّ الاَْنْبِيَاءَ لَمْ يُوَرِّثُوا دِينَارًا وَلَا دِرْهَمًا وَإِنَّمَا وَرَّثُوا الْعِلْمَ فَمَنْ أَخَذَ بِهِ أَخَذَ بِحَظَ وَافِر <br /> <br />Whoever follows a path to seek knowledge, Allah will show him the way to Paradise. The angels lower their wings being pleased with the one who seeks knowledge. Whoever is in the heavens and on earth, even the fish in the sea, ask for forgiveness for the scholar. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like that of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind Dinars and Dirhams, but they left behind knowledge; and whoever receives it, receives an abundance of good fortune.&#34;' <br /> <br />It was also reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Fatir Verse 31" href="/en/35-fatir/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> فاطر<span class="num-ar">35</span> :<span class="num-ar">32</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Fatir<span> 35</span>:<span>32</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Mala'ika</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Fatir Verse 33" href="/en/35-fatir/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=35,sura_dir="fatir",count_ayat=45,number_aya=32;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
