Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to Allah.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another [sinful soul]. And should one, soul, burdened heavily, with sin, call for, some of, its burden to be borne, by another, nothing of it will be borne, even if, the one called, be a relative, kin, such as a father or a son -- the impossibility of `having something borne [by another]' in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret, in other words, those who fear Him despite not having seen Him, for they are the ones to benefit from the warning, and observe the prayer, maintain [performance of] it. For whoever purifies himself, cleansing himself of idolatry and other [similar abominations], is purifying himself only for [the sake of] his own soul, because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the [end of the] journeying, the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى <br /> <br />And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden; <br /> <br />means, on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا <br /> <br />and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, <br /> <br />means, if the person who is carrying a heavy burden calls someone else to help him carry his load, all or part of it, <br /> <br />لَاا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى <br /> <br />nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin. <br /> <br />means, even if he is closely-related to him, even if he is his father or son, for each person will be preoccupied with his own self and his own situation. <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالغَيْبِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَةَ <br /> <br />You can warn only those who fear their Lord unseen and perform the <b>Salah</b>. <br /> <br />means, `the only ones who will draw a lesson from what you have brought are those who are possessed of insight and wisdom, who fear their Lord and who do as He commands.' <br /> <br />وَمَن تَزَكَّى فَإِنَّمَا يَتَزَكَّى لِنَفْسِهِ <br /> <br />And he who purifies himself, then he purifies only for the benefit of himself. <br /> <br />means, who does righteous deeds, the benefit of that will come back to him, <br /> <br />وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And to Allah is the Return. <br /> <br />means, to Him everything will ultimately return, and He is swift in bringing to account.
