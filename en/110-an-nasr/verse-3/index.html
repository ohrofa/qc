The Prophet (s), after this sra had been revealed, would frequently repeat the words subhna'Llhi wa bi-hamdihi, `Glory and praise be to God', and astaghfiru'Llha wa-atbu ilayhi, `I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him'; with [the revelation of] this [final sra] he realised that his end was near. The victory over Mecca was in Ramadn of year 8; the Prophet (s) passed away in Rab` I of the year 10. Meccan, consisting of 5 verses. When the Prophet (s) summoned his people and said, `I am a warner to you, [standing] before a terrible chastisement', his uncle, Ab Lahab, said, `May you perish! Is that what you have called us out for?', whereupon the following was revealed&#59;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Verily, my Lord has informed me that I will see a sign in my Ummah and He has commanded me that when I see it, I should glorify His praises and seek His forgiveness, for He is the One Who accepts repentance. And indeed I have seen it (i.e., the sign. <br /> <br />When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest <b>(Al-Fath)</b>. <br /> <br />And you see that the people enter Allah's religion in crowds. <br /> <br />So glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded this Hadith. <br /> <br />The meaning of <b>Al-Fath</b> here is the conquest of Makkah, and there is only one view concerning it. For indeed the different areas of the Arabs were waiting for the conquest of Makkah before they would accept Islam. They said, <br /> <br />&#34;If he (Muhammad is victorious over his people, then he is a (true) Prophet.&#34; <br /> <br />So when Allah gave him victory over Makkah, they entered into the religion of Allah (Islam) in crowds. Thus, two years did not pass (after the conquest of Makkah) before the peninsula of the Arabs was laden with faith. And there did not remain any of the tribes of the Arabs except that they professed (their acceptance) of Islam. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that `Amr bin Salamah said, <br /> <br />&#34;When Makkah was conquered, all of the people rushed to the Messenger of Allah to profess their Islam. The various regions were delaying their acceptance of Islam until Makkah was conquered. The people used to say, <br /> <br />`Leave him and his people alone. If he is victorious over them he is a (true) Prophet.&#34;' <br /> <br />We have researched the war expedition for conquest of Makkah in our book As-Surah. Therefore, whoever wishes he may review it there. <br /> <br />And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu `Ammar that a neighbor of Jabir bin `Abdullah told him, <br /> <br />&#34;I returned from a journey and Jabir bin `Abdullah came and greeted me. So I began to talk with him about the divisions among the people and what they had started doing. Thus, Jabir began to cry and he said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, <br /> <br />إِنَّ النَّاسَ دَخَلُوا فِي دِينِ اللهِ أَفْوَاجًا وَسَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْهُ أَفْوَاجًا <br /> <br />Verily, the people have entered into the religion of Allah in crowds and they will also leave it in crowds.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>An-Nasr</b>, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nasr Verse 2" href="/en/110-an-nasr/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النصر<span class="num-ar">110</span> :<span class="num-ar">3</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nasr<span> 110</span>:<span>3</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
