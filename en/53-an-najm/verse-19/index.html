idols and taking rivals to Him. They built houses for their idols to resemble the Ka`bah built by Prophet Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil. <br /> <br />أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّتَ <br />. <br /> <br /> <br />Have you then considered <b>Al-Lat</b>, <br /><b>Al-Lat</b> was a white stone with inscriptions on. There was a house built around <b>Al-Lat</b> in At-Ta'if with curtains, servants and a sacred courtyard around it. The people of At-Ta'if, the tribe of Thaqif and their allies, worshipped <b>Al-Lat</b>. They would boast to Arabs, except the Quraysh, that they had <b>Al-Lat</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;They derived <b>Al-Lat's</b> name from Allah's Name, and made it feminine. Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. &#34; <br /> <br />It was reported that <b>Al-Lat</b> is pronounced <b>Al-Lat</b> because, according to Abdullah bin Abbas, Mujahid, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, <b>Al-Lat</b> was a man who used to mix <b>Sawiq</b> (a kind of barley mash) with water for the pilgrims during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>. When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas said about Allah's statement, <br /> <br />اللَّتَ وَالْعُزَّى <br /> <br /> <br /><b>Al-Lat</b>, and <b>Al-`Uzza</b>. <br /> <br />&#34;Al-Lat was a man who used to mix <b>Sawiq</b> for the pilgrims.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;They also derived the name for their idol <b>Al-`Uzza</b> from Allah's Name <b>Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza</b> was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered <b>Al-`Uzza</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />During the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, Abu Sufyan said, &#34;We have <b>Al-`Uzza</b>, but you do not have <b>Al-`Uzza</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger replied, <br /> <br />قُولُوا اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم <br /> <br />Say, &#34;Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.&#34; <br /><b>Manat</b> was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere <b>Manat</b> during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>. They used to announce <b>Hajj</b> to the <b>Ka`bah</b> from next to <b>Manat</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari collected a statement from A'ishah with this meaning. <br /> <br />There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the <b>Ka`bah</b>, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of <b>Al-`Uzza</b> was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him, <br /> <br />ارْجِعْ فَإِنَّكَ لَمْ تَصْنَعْ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it. <br /> <br />Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of <b>Al-`Uzza</b> saw him, they started invoking by calling <b>Al-`Uzza</b>! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him, <br /> <br />تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى <br /> <br />That was Al-`Uzza!&#34; <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Lat</b> belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of <b>Al-Lat</b> and its servants.&#34; <br /> <br />I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy <b>Al-Lat</b>. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that <b>Manat</b> used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). <b>Manat</b> was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq said that <b>Dhul-Khalasah</b> was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. <br /> <br />I say that <b>Dhul-Khalasah</b> was called the Southern <b>Ka`bah</b>, and the <b>Ka`bah</b> in Makkah was called the Northern <b>Ka`bah</b>. The Messenger of Allah sent Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali to <b>Dhul-Khalasah</b> and he destroyed it. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq said that <b>Fals</b> was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. <br /> <br />Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah sent Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to Ali as war spoils. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. <br /> <br />In Sindad there was <b>Dhul-Ka`bat</b>, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes. <br /><b>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّتَ اللَّتَ وَالْعُزَّى <br /> <br />وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاُْخْرَى</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>Have you considered al-Lt and al-`Uzz,</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Have ye seen Lat. and 'Uzza,</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Najm Verse 18" href="/en/53-an-najm/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> النجم <span class="num-ar">53</span> : <span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Najm <span>53</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Najm Verse 20" href="/en/53-an-najm/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
