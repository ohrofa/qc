They sometimes commit minor sins, but they will be forgiven these minor sins and covered from exposure, as Allah mentioned in another Ayah; <br /> <br />إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَأيِرَ مَا تُنهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّيَـتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلً كَرِيماً <br /> <br />If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance.
