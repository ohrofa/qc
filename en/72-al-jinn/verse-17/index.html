That We might try them thereby. <br /> <br />The commentators have differed over the explanation of this. There are two views concerning it. <br /> <br />- The First View That if the deviant ones would stand firmly upon the path of Islam, being just upon it and remaining upon it, <br />لَاأَسْقَيْنَاهُم مَّاء غَدَقًا <br /> (We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance). <br /> <br />meaning, a lot. The intent behind this is to say that they would be given an abundance of sustenance. <br /> <br />With this, the meaning of Allah's statement, <br />لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ <br /> (That We might try them thereby). is that, <br /> <br />`We will test them.' <br /> <br />As Malik reported from Zayd bin Aslam, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;That We might try them - means, so that We may test them to see who will remain upon the guidance from those who will turn back to sin.&#34; <br /><b>Mentioning Those Who held this View</b> <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported similar to this from Ibn `Abbas, and likewise said Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Ata, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. <br /> <br />Muqatil said, <br /> <br />&#34;This Ayah was revealed about the disbelievers of the Quraysh when they were deprived of rain for seven years.&#34; <br /> <br />- The Second View <br />وَأَلَّوِ اسْتَقَامُوا عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ <br /> (If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way), <br /> <br />meaning, of misguidance. <br /> <br />لَاأَسْقَيْنَاهُم مَّاء غَدَقًا <br /> We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance. <br /> <br />meaning, `then We would have increased their sustenance to allow a gradual respite.' <br /> <br />As Allah says, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَأ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ <br /> <br />So, when they forgot that with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. (6&#59;44) <br /> <br />Allah also says, <br /> <br />أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ <br /> <br />نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ <br /> <br />Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them. We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not. (23&#59;55,56) <br /> <br />This is the view of Abu Mijlaz and it agrees with the opinion of Ibn Humayd. <br /> <br />For verily, he (Ibn Humayd) said concerning Allah's statement, <br />وَأَلَّوِ اسْتَقَامُوا عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ <br /> (If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way), <br /> <br />&#34;This means the path of misguidance.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this. <br /> <br />Al-Baghawi also mentioned it from Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Zayd bin Aslam, Al-Kalbi and Ibn Kaysan. <br /> <br />It seems that he (Al-Baghawi) took this position. And it is supported by Allah's saying, &#34;That We might try them thereby.&#34; <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُعْرِضْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِ يَسْلُكْهُ عَذَابًا صَعَدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And whosoever turns away from the Reminder of his Lord, He will cause him to enter in a <b>Sa`ad</b> torment. <br /> <br />meaning, a harsh, severe, agonizing and painful punishment. <br /> <br />Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all said, <br />عَذَابًا صَعَدًا <br /> (in a Sa`ad torment). <br /> <br />&#34;This means harsh having no relaxation in it.&#34; <br /> <br />It has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is a mountain in Hell.&#34; <br /> <br />It has been related from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is a well in Hell.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Jinn Verse 16" href="/en/72-al-jinn/verse-16/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الجن<span class="num-ar">72</span> :<span class="num-ar">17</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Jinn<span> 72</span>:<span>17</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Jinn Verse 18" href="/en/72-al-jinn/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
