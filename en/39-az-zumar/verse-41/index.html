And Allah is a Trustee over all things. (11&#59;12) <br /> <br />فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ <br /> <br />your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning. (13&#59;40) <br /><b>Allah is the One Who causes Death and gives Life</b> <br /> <br />Then Allah tells us that He is in control of all things and does as He wills. He causes men to die (the &#34;greater death&#34;) when He sends the angels to take men's souls from their bodies, and He causes them to &#34;die a lesser death&#34; when they sleep. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَتَوَفَّـكُم بِالَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِالنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ لِيُقْضَى أَجَلٌ مّسَمًّى ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَأءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لَا يُفَرِّطُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, then He raises (wakes) you up again that a term appointed be fulfilled, then (in the end) unto Him will be your return. Then He will inform you of that which you used to do. <br /> <br />He is the Irresistible, over His servants, and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one's good and bad deeds) over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (angels) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. (6&#59;60-61) <br /> <br />Here Allah mentions the two deaths, <br /> <br />the lesser death then the greater death after it; <br /> <br />in this <b>Ayah</b> He mentions the greater then the lesser.
