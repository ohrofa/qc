Such as when the believers then the disbelievers are mentioned, or when Paradise then Hell are described, and so on, and this is the meaning of oft-repeated. <br /> <br />Examples include the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الاٌّبْرَارَ لَفِى نَعِيمٍ <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ الْفُجَّارَ لَفِى جَحِيمٍ <br /> <br />Verily, the most righteous will be in delight; and verily, the most wicked will be in the blazing Fire (Hell). (82&#59;13-14) <br /><b> <br />كَلَّ إِنَّ كِتَابَ الفُجَّارِ لَفِي سِجِّينٍ <br /></b> <br /> (Nay! Truly, the Record of the most wicked is (preserved) in <b>Sijjin</b>), until <br />كَلَّ إِنَّ كِتَابَ الاَْبْرَارِ لَفِي عِلِّيِّينَ <br /> (Nay! Verily, the Record of the most righteous is (preserved) in <b>`Illiyyin</b>), (83&#59;7-18) <br /><b> <br />هَذَا ذِكْرٌ وَإِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ لَحُسْنَ مَأبٍ <br /></b>(This is a Reminder. And verily, for those who have <b>Taqwa</b> is a good final return (Paradise)), until; <b> <br />هَذَا <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ لِلطَّاغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَأبٍ <br /></b> (This is so! And for those who transgress, there will be an evil final return (Fire)). (38&#59;49-55) <br /> <br />And there are other similar passages. All of this has to do with it being oft-repeated, i.e., when two meanings are referred to. But when a passage is about one thing, with some parts of it resembling others, this is; <br /> <br />&#34;its parts resembling each other.&#34; <br /> <br />This is not the same as the <b>Mutashabihat</b> mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />مِنْهُ ايَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ <br /> <br />In it are <b>Ayat</b> that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear. (3&#59;7) <br /> <br />that refers to something else altogether. <br /> <br />تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah. <br /> <br />means, this is the description of the righteous, when they hear the Words of the Compeller, the Protector, the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving, because they understand the promises and warnings contained therein. The frightening words and threats make their skin shiver from fear. <br /><b> <br />ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ <br /></b> (Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah), because of their hope for His mercy and kindness. They are unlike others, the wicked, immoral sinners, in a number of ways&#59; <br /> <br />- First They listen to the recitation of the <b>Ayat</b> (of the Qur'an), while those (sinners) listen to poetic verse recited by female singers. <br /> <br />- Second When the <b>Ayat</b> of <b>Ar-Rahman</b> are recited to them, they fall down in prostration weeping, with the proper attitude of fear, hope, love, understanding and knowledge, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا الْمُوْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَوةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ <br /> <br />أُوْلـيِكَ هُمُ الْمُوْمِنُونَ حَقّاً لَّهُمْ دَرَجَـتٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ <br /> <br />The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His <b>Ayat</b> are recited unto them, they increase their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord; Who perform the <b>Salah</b> and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in it. <br /> <br />For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (i.e., Paradise). (8&#59;2-4) <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً <br /> <br />And those who, when they are reminded of the <b>Ayat</b> of their Lord, fall not on them (as if they were) deaf and blind. (25&#59;73) <br /> <br />When they hear the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah, they are not too busy to pay attention to them; they listen to them and understand their meanings. So they act upon them and prostrate when they hear them, out of understanding, not out of ignorance and blind following of others. <br /> <br />- Third they adhere to the correct etiquette when they listen to them. As the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, used to do when they listened to the words of Allah recited by the Messenger of Allah. Their skin would shiver, and their hearts would soften to the remembrance of Allah. They did not shout or do other actions that are not natural; on the contrary, they would sit quietly with the proper attitude of fear, in an unparalleled fashion. They attained the victory of praise from their Lord in this world and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said, &#34;Ma`mar told us that Qatadah, may Allah have mercy on him, recited, <b> <br />تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ <br /></b> (The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah), and said, <br /> <br />`This is the characteristic of the friends of Allah; Allah has described them in this manner, saying that their skin shivers, their eyes weep and their hearts find rest to the remembrance of Allah. He did not say that they lose their minds and swoon; that is the characteristic of the followers of innovation, and that comes from the Shaytan.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاء <br /> <br />That is the guidance of Allah. He guides therewith whom He wills; <br /> <br />means, this is the characteristic of those whom Allah has guided, and anyone who does anything different is one of those whom Allah has sent astray. <br /> <br />وَمَن يُضْلِلْ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and whomever Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 22" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 24" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
