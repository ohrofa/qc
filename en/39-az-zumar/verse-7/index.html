And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another [soul], in other words, it will not bear [the responsibility for] it. Then to your Lord will be your return, whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts, of what is in the hearts [of men].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Allah hates Disbelief and is pleased with Gratitude</b> <br /> <br />Allah warns, <br /> <br />إِن تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنكُمْ <br /> <br />If you disbelieve, then verily, Allah is not in need of you; <br /> <br />Allah tells us that He is Independent and has no need of anything in creation. <br /> <br />This is like the Ayah in which Musa, peace be upon him, says&#59; <br /> <br />إِن تَكْفُرُواْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ <br /> <br />&#34;If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.&#34; (14&#59;8) <br /> <br />In Sahih Muslim, it says&#59; <br /> <br />يَا عِبَادِي لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَاخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْيًا <br /> <br />&#34;O My servants, if the first and the last of you, men and Jinn alike, were all to be as evil as the most evil man among you, that would not diminish from My sovereignty in the least.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَرْضَى لِعِبَادِهِ الْكُفْرَ <br /> <br />He likes not disbelief for His servants. <br /> <br />means, He does not like it and He does not enjoin it. <br /> <br />وَإِن تَشْكُرُوا يَرْضَهُ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />And if you are grateful, He is pleased therewith for you. <br /> <br />means&#59;He likes this for you and He will increase His favor upon you. <br /> <br />وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى <br /> <br />No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. <br /> <br />means, no person can bear anything for another; each person will be asked about his own affairs. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُم مَّرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you what you used to do. Verily, He is the All-Knower of that which is in breasts. <br /> <br />means, nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him. <br /><b>It is an aspect of Man's Disbelief that He remembers Allah at times of difficulty then associates others with Him after He has been relieved of His Distress</b> <br /> <br />Allah says,</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 6" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 8" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
