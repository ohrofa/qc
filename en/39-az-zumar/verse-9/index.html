(3&#59;113) <br /> <br />And Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />أَمَّنْ هُوَ قَانِتٌ انَاء اللَّيْلِ سَاجِدًا وَقَايِمًا <br /> <br />Is one who is obedient to Allah, <b>Ana'a Al-Layl</b> prostrating and standing, <br /> <br />meaning, one who is humble and fears Allah when he prostrates and stands (in prayer). <br /> <br />It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The obedient one is one who obeys Allah and His Messenger.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said, <br /><b>Ana'a Al-Layl</b> means in the depths of the night. <br /> <br />يَحْذَرُ الاْخِرَةَ وَيَرْجُو رَحْمَةَ رَبِّهِ <br /> <br />fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord. <br /> <br />means, in his worship he feels both fear and hope. Both are essential in worship, and fear should be stronger during one's lifetime. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br />يَحْذَرُ الاْخِرَةَ وَيَرْجُو رَحْمَةَ رَبِّهِ <br /> (fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord), At the time of death, hope is uppermost, as Imam `Abd bin Humayd recorded in his Musnad from Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah entered upon a man who was dying, and said to him, <br />كَيْفَ تَجِدُكَ <br /> (How do you feel?) <br /> <br />He said, `I am both afraid and hopeful.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَجْتَمِعَانِ فِي قَلْبِ عَبْدٍ فِي مِثْلِ هَذَا الْمَوْطِنِ إِلاَّ أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الَّذِي يَرْجُو وَأَمَّنَهُ الَّذِي يَخَافُه <br /> <br />&#34;These do not co-exist in a person's heart at times such as this, but Allah will give him what he hopes for and protect him from that which he fears.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Yasar bin Hatim from Ja`far bin Sulayman. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Tamim Ad-Dari, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ قَرَأَ بِمِايَةِ ايَةٍ فِي لَيْلَةٍ كُتِبَ لَهُ قُنُوتُ لَيْلَة <br /> <br /> <br />Whoever recites one hundred <b>Ayat</b> in one night, it will be recorded as if he prayed all night. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in <b>Al-Yawm wal-Laylah</b>. <br /> <br />قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Are those who know equal to those who know not?&#34; <br /> <br />means, is this one equal with the one who sets up rivals to Allah to mislead (men) from His path? <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُوا الاَْلْبَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It is only men of understanding who will remember. <br /> <br />means, the only one who will understand the difference between them is the one who has understanding. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 8" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">9</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>9</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 10" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
