Until, when they have reached it, and its gates are opened, its keepers will say to them, “Did not messengers from among you come to you, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?” They will say, “Yes, but the verdict of punishment is justified against the disbelievers.”</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And those who disbelieve will be driven, violently, to Hell in troops, in separate groups, until, when they reach it, its gates are opened (futihat abwbuh is the response to idh, `when') and its keepers will say to them, `Did there not come to you [any] messengers from among yourselves, reciting to you the signs of your Lord, the Qur'n and otherwise, and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours?' They will say, `Yes, indeed; but the word of chastisement -- namely, the verse&#59; Assuredly I will fill Hell ... [Q. 11&#59;119] -- against the disbelievers has been fulfilled'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>How the Disbelievers will be driven to Hell</b> <br /> <br />Allah informs, <br /> <br />وَسِيقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِلَى جَهَنَّمَ زُمَرًا <br /> <br />And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, <br /> <br />Allah tells us how the doomed disbeliever will be driven to Hell by force, with threats and warnings. <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا <br /> <br />The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. (52&#59;13) <br /> <br />which means, they will be pushed and forced towards it, and they will be extremely thirsty, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />يَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ الْمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى الرَّحْمَـنِ وَفْداً وَنَسُوقُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ إِلَى جَهَنَّمَ وِرْداً <br /> <br />The Day We shall gather those who have <b>Taqwa</b> unto the Most Gracious, like a delegation. And We shall drive the criminals to Hell, in a thirsty state. (19&#59;85-86) <br /> <br />When they are in that state, they will be blind, dumb and deaf, and some of them will be walking on their faces&#59; <br /> <br />وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا <br /> <br />and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire. (17&#59;97) <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا جَاوُوهَا فُتِحَتْ أَبْوَابُهَا <br /> <br />till when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. <br /> <br />means, as soon as they arrive, the gates will be opened quickly, in order to hasten on their punishment. <br /> <br />وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا <br /> <br />And its keepers will say&#59; <br /> <br />Then the keepers of Hell, who are stern angels, severe and strong, will say to them by way of rebuking and reprimanding&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ <br /> <br />Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, <br /> <br />meaning, `of your own kind, so that you could have spoken to them and learned from them,' <br /> <br />يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ايَاتِ رَبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />reciting to you the <b>Ayat</b> of your Lord, <br /> <br />means, `establishing proof against you that what they brought to you was true,' <br /> <br />وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَاء يَوْمِكُمْ هَذَا <br /> <br />and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours, <br /> <br />means, `warning you of the evil of this Day.' <br /> <br />&#59; <br /> <br />قَالُوا بَلَى <br /> <br />They will say, &#34;Yes&#34;, <br /> <br />meaning, the disbeliever will say to them that they did come to us and warn us and establish proof and evidence against us,' <br /> <br />وَلَكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ الْعَذَابِ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers! <br /> <br />means, `but we rejected them and went against them, because we were already doomed, as it was decreed that we would be, because we had turned away from the truth towards falsehood.' <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />قَالُوا بَلَى قَدْ جَاءنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلَلٍ كَبِيرٍ <br /> <br /> <br />وَقَالُوا لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِي أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ <br /> <br /> Every time a group is cast therein, its keeper will ask&#59;&#34;Did no warner come to you&#34; They will say&#59;&#34;Yes, indeed a warner came to us, but we denied him and said&#59;`Allah never revealed anything; you are only in great error.&#34;' And they will say&#59;&#34;Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!&#34; (67&#59;8-10) <br /> <br />which means, they will feel regret and will blame themselves. <br /> <br />فَاعْتَرَفُوا بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًا لاَِّصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ <br /> <br /> <br />Then they will confess their sin. So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire! (67&#59;11) <br /> <br />means, they are lost and doomed</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 70" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 72" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
