These are the ones that are mentioned in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b>, eight kinds -- a pair of sheep, a pair of goats, a pair of camels and a pair of oxen. <br /> <br />يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ <br /> <br />He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, <br /> <br />means, He forms you in your mothers' wombs. <br /> <br />خَلْقًا مِن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ <br /> <br />creation after creation. <br /> <br />Everyone of you is originally a <b>Nutfah</b>, then he becomes an <b>`Alaqah</b>, then he becomes a <b>Mudghah</b>, then he is created and becomes flesh and bones and nerves and veins, and the <b>Ruh</b> (soul) is breathed into him, and he becomes another type of creation. <br /> <br />فَتَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَـلِقِينَ <br /> <br />So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators. (23&#59;14) <br /> <br />فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ ثَلَثٍ <br /> <br />in three veils of darkness, <br /> <br />means, in the darkness of the womb, the darkness of the placenta which blankets and protects the child, and the darkness of the belly. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ <br /> <br />Such is Allah your Lord. <br /> <br />means, the One Who created the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and created you and your forefathers, is the Lord. <br /> <br />لَهُ الْمُلْكُ <br /> <br />His is the kingdom, <br /> <br />i.e. To Him belong sovereignty and control over all of that. <br /> <br />لَاا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ <br /><b>La ilaha illa Huwa</b>. <br /> <br />means, no one else should be worshipped except Him alone with no partner or associate. <br /> <br />فَأَنَّى تُصْرَفُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How then are you turned away? <br /> <br />means, how can you worship anything besides Him? What has happened to your minds</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 5" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 7" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
