He is the Sovereign and Controller alternating the night and day. <br /> <br />يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ <br /> <br />He makes the night to go in the day and makes the day to go in the night. <br /> <br />means, He has subjugated them and He causes them to alternate without ceasing, each seeking the other rapidly, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا <br /> <br />He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly. (7&#59;54) <br /> <br />This is the meaning of that which was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. <br /> <br />وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لاَِجَلٍ مُسَمًّى <br /> <br />And He has subjected the sun and the moon. Each running for an appointed term. <br /> <br />means, for a period of time that is known to Allah, then it will come to an end on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />أَلَا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفَّارُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving. <br /> <br />means, beside His might, greatness and pride, He is Oft-Forgiving to those who disobey Him but then turn to Him in repentance</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 4" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزمر<span class="num-ar">39</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zumar<span> 39</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Ghuraf</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zumar Verse 6" href="/en/39-az-zumar/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
