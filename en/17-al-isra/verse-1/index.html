This journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of hardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan pagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from trading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the “Year of Sadness,” which included the death of the Prophet’s uncle Abu Ṭâlib, the major defender of Muḥammad (ﷺ) despite his disbelief in his message, as well as the death of the Prophet’s beloved wife Khadîjah. The Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Burâq) from Mecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in prayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-Mi’râj, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to observe five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in {53&#58;13}–18.]] Indeed, He[[ i.e., Allah.]] alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.</p></div></div></article><article id="ruwwad-translation-center" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#ruwwad-translation-center"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>3</span> Ruwwad Translation Center</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>Glory be to the One Who took His slave [Muhammad] by night from the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah] to the Aqsā Mosque [in Jerusalem] whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs.

Indeed He is the Hearing, the Seeing, that is to say, the Knower of the Prophet's (s) sayings and deeds. Thus He [God] was gracious to him by way of [carrying him on] the night journey, which comprised his encountering the [other] prophets, his ascension to heaven and the sight of the marvels of the [Divine] Realm and His communion, exalted be He, with him. For he [the Prophet] (s) said&#59; `I was brought al-Burq, a white animal, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; it was able to place its hoof [back] towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until I reached the Holy House [of Jerusalem]. [There] I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets fasten [their animals]. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out, Gabriel came to me with a jug of wine and a jug of milk, and so I chose the milk. Gabriel said [to me], &#34;You have made the right choice [by choosing] the primordial nature (fitra)&#34;.' He [the Prophet] continued [the narration], `We then ascended to the heaven of this world, whereat Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;, &#34;And who is with you?&#34;, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been sent for?&#34;. &#34;Yes, he has been sent for&#34;. Then it was opened for us, and lo! Adam stood before me; he greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the second heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;, &#34;And who is with you?&#34;, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been called forth?&#34;. &#34;Yes, he has been called forth&#34;. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there were the two [maternal] cousins, John and Jesus. They greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the third heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;, &#34;And who is with you?&#34;, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been sent for?&#34; it was asked. &#34;Yes, he has been sent for&#34;. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there was Joseph standing before me, and indeed he had been given one half of all beauty! He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the fourth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;, &#34;And who is with you?&#34;, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been called forth?&#34;, it was asked. &#34;Yes, he has been called forth&#34;, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Enoch (Idrs). He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the fifth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;. &#34;And who is with you?&#34; it was asked, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he replied. &#34;Has he been sent for?&#34;, it was said. &#34;Yes, he has been sent for&#34;, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Aaron. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the sixth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;; &#34;and who is with you?&#34;, &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been called forth?&#34;, it was asked. &#34;Yes, he has been called forth&#34;. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Moses. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the seventh heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;. He replied, &#34;Gabriel&#34;, &#34;And who is with you?&#34;; &#34;Muhammad (s)&#34;, he said. &#34;Has he been called forth?&#34;, it was asked. &#34;Yes, he has been called forth&#34;, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Abraham, leaning [seated] against the Frequented House (al-bayt al-ma`mr), into which 70,000 angels enter every day never to return thereto. I was then taken to the Lote-Tree of the Boundary (sidrat al- muntah), and lo! its leaves resemble the ears of elephants, its fruits like pitchers [in size]. When some command of God's enveloped it, it changed, and lo! none of God's creation could describe it for all its beauty'. He [the Prophet] continued&#59; `God then revealed to me what He revealed and prescribed for me fifty prayers each day and night. I then descended until I reached Moses and he said, &#34;What has your Lord prescribed for your community?&#34; I said, &#34;Fifty prayers each day and night&#34;. He said, &#34;Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation, for your community will not have the capacity for it&#59; I have tried the Children of Israel and have experience of them [not being up to the task].&#34; I then went back to my Lord and said, &#34;My Lord! Lighten that [prescription] for my community&#34;, and so He reduced it for me by five. I went back to Moses who asked me, &#34;What did you do?&#34;. I said to him, `He has reduced it for me by five', to which he said, &#34;Your community will not have the capacity for this; so go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community&#34;. Thus I kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses, with Him reducing it by five each time until He said, &#34;O Muhammad (s)! They shall be five prayers each day and night, every prayer will be worth [the reward of] ten [prayers]; that then makes fifty prayers. And whoever intends a good deed but does not perform it, I shall count it for him as one [done]; and if he performs it, I shall count it for him as ten; and whoever intends an evil deed, but does not perform it, it shall not be recorded against him; but if he performs it, it shall be recorded [only] as one evil deed&#34;. I then descended until I reached Moses. I informed him and he said, &#34;Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community, because your community will not have the capacity for this&#34;; and I said, &#34;I have gone back to my Lord so many times that I am ashamed [to go again]&#34;. This [hadth] is reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhr and Muslim]; but the wording [of this version] is that of [the report in the Sahh of] Muslim. Al-Hkim [al- Naysbr] reports in the Mustadrak by way of Ibn `Abbs that he said, `The Prophet (s) said, &#34;I did see my Lord, Mighty and Majestic&#34;.'</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>The Isra' (Night Journey)</b> <br /> <br />Allah glorifies Himself, <br /> <br />سُبْحَانَ <br /> <br /> <br />Glorified be He, <br /> <br />Allah glorifies Himself, for His ability to do that which none but He can do, for there is no God but He and no Lord besides Him. <br /> <br />الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ <br /> <br />Who took His servant for a Journey, <br /> <br />refers to Muhammad. <br /> <br />لَيْلً <br /> <br />by Night, <br /> <br />means, in the depths of the night. <br /> <br />مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> <br />from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, <br /> <br />means the <b>Masjid</b> in Makkah. <br /> <br />إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الَاقْصَى <br /> <br />to <b>Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa</b>, <br /> <br />means the Sacred House which is in Jerusalem, the origin of the Prophets from the time of Ibrahim <b>Al-Khalil</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophets all gathered there, and he (Muhammad) led them in prayer in their own homeland.

One stride of this creature covered a distance as far as it could see. <br /> <br />I rode on it and it took me to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> (Jerusalem), where I tethered it at the hitching post of the Prophets. Then I entered and prayed two <b>Rak`ahs</b> there, and came out. <br /> <br />Jibril brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk. <br /> <br />Jibril said&#59;`You have chosen the <b>Fitrah</b> (natural instinct).' <br /> <br />قَالَ ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا فَاسْتَفْتَحَ جِبْرِيلُ فَقِيلَ لَهُ <br /> <br />مَنْ أَنْتَ <br /> <br />قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ <br /> <br />قِيلَ وَمَنْ مَعَكَ <br /> <br />قَالَ مُحَمَّدٌ <br /> <br />قِيلَ وَقَدْ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />قَالَ قَدْ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَإِذَا أَنَا بِأدَمَ فَرَحَّبَ بِي وَدَعَا لِي بِخَيْرٍ <br /> <br />Then I was taken up to the first heaven and Jibril asked for it to be opened. <br /> <br />It was said, `Who are you?'

So He reduced it by five. <br /> <br />I came back down until I met Musa and he asked me, `What did you do?' <br /> <br />I said, `(My Lord) reduced (my burden) by five.' <br /> <br />He said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce (the burden) for your <b>Ummah</b>.' <br /> <br />قَالَ&#59;فَلَمْ أَزَلْ أَرْجِعُ بَيْنَ رَبِّي وَبَيْنَ مُوسَى وَيَحُطُّ عَنِّي خَمْسًا خَمْسًا حَتَّى قَالَ <br /> <br />I kept going back between my Lord and Musa, and (my Lord) reduced it by five each time, until He said, <br /> <br />يَا مُحَمَّدُ <br /> <br />هُنَّ خَمْسُ صَلَوَاتٍ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ وَلَيْلَةٍ بِكُلِّ صَلَاةٍ عَشْرٌ، فَتِلْكَ خَمْسُونَ صَلَاةً وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِحَسَنَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ حَسَنَةً، فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ عَشْرًا <br /> <br />وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِسَيِّئَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا لَمْ تُكْتَبْ شَيْئًا، فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ سَيِّئَةً وَاحِدَةً، <br /> <br />`O Muhammad, <br /> <br />these are five prayers every day and night, and for every prayer there is (the reward of) ten, so they are (like) fifty prayers. <br /> <br />Whoever wants to do something good then does not do it, one good deed will be recorded for him, and if he does it, ten good deeds will be recorded for him. <br /> <br />Whoever wants to do something evil and does not do it, no evil deed will be recorded for him, and if he does it, one evil deed will be recorded for him.' <br /> <br />I came down until I reached Musa, and told him about this. <br /> <br />He said&#59;`Go back to your Lord and ask him to reduce (the burden) for your <b>Ummah</b>, for they will never be able to do that.' <br /> <br />I had kept going back to my Lord until I felt too shy. <br /> <br />This version was also recorded by Muslim. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded Anas saying that; <br /><b>Al-Buraq</b> was brought to the Prophet on the Night of the <b>Isra'</b> with his saddle and reins ready for riding. The animal shied, and Jibril said to him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Why are you doing this! By Allah, no one has ever ridden you who is more honored by Allah than him.&#34; <br /> <br />At this, <b>Al-Buraq</b> started to sweat. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said it is <b>Gharib</b>. <br /> <br />Ahmad also recorded that Anas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَمَّا عَرَجَ بِي رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مَرَرْتُ بِقَوْمٍ لَهُمْ أَظْفَارٌ مِنْ نُحَاسٍ يَخْمِشُونَ بِهَا وُجُوهَهُمْ وَصُدُورَهُمْ فَقُلْتُ مَنْ هوُلَاءِ يَا جِبْرِيلُ قَالَ هَوُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ لُحُومَ النَّاسِ وَيَقَعُونَ فِي أَعْرَاضِهِم <br /> <br />When I was taken up to my Lord (during <b>Al-Mi'raj</b>), I passed by people who had nails of copper with which they were scratching their faces and chests. I asked, `Who are these, O Jibril!' <br /> <br />He said, `These are those who ate the flesh of the people (i.e., backbiting) and slandered their honor.' <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Abu Dawud. <br /> <br />Anas also said that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَرَرْتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي عَلَى مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ قَايِمًا يُصَلِّي فِي قَبْرِه <br /> <br />On the night when I was taken on my Night Journey (<b>Al-Isra'</b>), I passed by Musa, who was standing, praying in his grave. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim. <br /><b>The Report of Anas bin Malik from Malik bin Sa`sa`ah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that Malik bin Sa`sa`ah told him that the Prophet of Allah told them about the night in which he was taken on the Night Journey (<b>Al-Isra'</b>). <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />بَيْنَمَا أَنَا فِي الْحَطِيمِ وَرُبَّمَا قَالَ قَتَادَةُ فِي الْحِجْرِ مُضْطَجِعًا إِذْ أَتَانِي اتٍ فَجَعَلَ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ الاَْوْسَطِ بَيْنَ الثَّلَثَةِ قَالَ فَأَتَانِي فَقَدَّ سَمِعْتُ قَتَادَةَ يَقُولُ فَشَقَّ مَا بَيْنَ هَذِهِ إِلَى هَذِه <br /> <br />While I was lying down in <b>Al-Hatim</b> (or maybe, Qatadah said, in <b>Al-Hijr</b>) 'someone came to me and said to his companion, `The one who is in the middle of these three.' He came to me and opened me. <br /> <br />I (one of the narrators) heard Qatadah say, `split me - from here to here.' <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59;&#34;I said to Al-Jarud, who was beside me, `What does that mean?' <br /> <br />He said, `From the top of his chest to below his navel', and I heard him say, `from his throat to below his navel'. <br /> <br />The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />فَاسْتُخْرِجَ قَلْبِي قَالَ فَأُتِيتُ بِطَسْتٍ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ مَمْلُوءَةٍ إِيمَانًا وَحِكْمَةً فَغُسِلَ قَلْبِي ثُمَّ حُشِيَ ثُمَّ أُعِيدَ ثُمَّ أُتِيتُ بِدَابَّةٍ دُونَ الْبَغْلِ وَفَوْقَ الْحِمَارِ أَبْيَض <br /> <br />He took out my heart and brought a golden vessel filled with faith and wisdom. He washed my heart then filled it up and put it back, then a white animal was brought to me that was smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey. <br /> <br />Al-Jarud said, `Was this <b>Al-Buraq</b>?, O Abu Hamzah!' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes, and its stride covered a distance as far as it could see.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />فَحُمِلْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَانْطَلَقَ بِي جِبْرِيلُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ حَتَّى أَتَى بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا فَاسْتَفْتَحَ فَقِيلَ مَنْ هَذَا <br /> <br />قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ <br /> <br />قِيلَ وَمَنْ مَعَكَ <br /> <br />قَالَ مُحَمَّدٌ <br /> <br />قِيلَ أَوَ قَدْ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />قَالَ نَعَمْ <br /> <br />فَقِيلَ مَرْحَبًا بِهِ وَلَنِعْمَ الْمَجِيءُ جَاءَ <br /> <br />قَالَ فَفُتِحَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا خَلَصْتُ فَإِذَا فِيهَا ادَمُ عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ <br /> <br />قَالَ هَذَا أَبُوكَ ادَمُ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَرَدَّ السَّلَامَ ثُمَّ قَالَ مَرْحَبًا بِالاْابْنِ الصَّالِحِ وَالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ <br /> <br />I was mounted upon it and Jibril brought me to the first heaven, and asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Jibril.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Who is with you?' <br /> <br />He said, `Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Has his Mission started?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Welcome to him, blessed is the one who comes.' <br /> <br />So it was opened for us and when I entered, I saw Adam. <br /> <br />(Jibril) said, `This is your father Adam, greet him.' So I greeted him, and he returned the greeting then said, `Welcome to the righteous son and righteous Prophet.' <br /> <br />Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' <br /> <br />Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Has he been called?' <br /> <br />Gabriel answered in the affirmative. <br /> <br />Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened. <br /> <br />When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and 'Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. <br /> <br />Gabriel said (to me), 'These are Yahya and 'Isa; pay them your greetings.' So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' <br /> <br />Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Has he been called?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied in the affirmative. <br /> <br />Then it was said, 'He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!' <br /> <br />The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Yusuf (Joseph). <br /> <br />Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Yusuf; pay him your greetings.' <br /> <br />So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' <br /> <br />Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was asked, 'Has he been called?' <br /> <br />Gabriel replied in the affirmative. <br /> <br />Then it was said, 'He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!' <br /> <br />The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Idris; pay him your greetings.' <br /> <br />So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' <br /> <br />Then I was taken up to the fifth heaven, and (Jibril) asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Jibril.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Who is with you?' <br /> <br />He said, `Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Has his Mission started?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Welcome to him, blessed is the one who comes.' <br /> <br />So it was opened for us and when I entered, I saw Harun. <br /> <br />(Jibril) said, `This is Harun, greet him.' So I greeted him, and he returned the greeting then said, `Welcome to the righteous brother and righteous Prophet.' <br /> <br />Then I was taken up to the sixth heaven, and (Jibril) asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Jibril.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Who is with you?' <br /> <br />He said, `Muhammad.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Has his Mission started?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Welcome to him, blessed is the one who comes.' So it was opened for us and when I entered, I saw Musa. <br /> <br />(Jibril) said, `This is Musa, greet him.' <br /> <br />So I greeted him, and he returned the greeting then said, `Welcome to the righteous brother and righteous Prophet.' <br /> <br />When I passed by him, he wept, and it was said to him, `Why are you weeping' He said, `I am weeping because a young man was sent after me and more people from his Ummah than from mine will enter Paradise.' <br /> <br />قَالَ ثُمَّ صَعِدَ حَتَّى أَتَى السَّمَاءَ السَّابِعَةَ <br />هَذَا إبْرَاهِيمُ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ فَرَدَّ السَّلَمَ ثُمَّ قَالَ مَرْحَبًا بِالاْبْنِ الصَّالِحِ وَالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ <br /> <br />Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven, and (Jibril) asked for it to be opened. It was said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Jibril.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Who is with you?' <br /> <br />He said, `Muhammad'. <br /> <br />It was said, `Has his Mission started?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />It was said, `Welcome to him, blessed is the one who comes.' <br /> <br />So it was opened for us and when I entered, I saw Ibrahim. <br /> <br />(Jibril) said, `This is Ibrahim, greet him.' <br /> <br />So I greeted him, and he returned the greeting then said, `Welcome to the righteous son and righteous Prophet.' <br /> <br />قَالَ ثُمَّ رُفِعَتْ إِلَيَّ سِدْرَةُ الْمُنْتَهَى فَإِذَا نَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَرَ وَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا مِثْلُ اذَانِ الْفِيَلةِ <br /> <br />فَقَالَ هَذِهِ سِدْرَةُ الْمُنْتَهَى قَالَ وَإِذَا أَرْبَعَةُ أَنْهَارٍ نَهْرَانِ بَاطِنَانِ وَنَهْرَانِ ظَاهِرَانِ <br /> <br />فَقُلْتُ مَا هَذَا يَا جِبْرِيلُ <br /> <br />قَالَ أَمَّا الْبَاطِنَانِ فَنَهْرَانِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَأَمَّا الظَّاهِرَانِ فَالنِّيلُ وَالْفُرَاتُ <br /> <br />قَالَ ثُمَّ رُفِعَ إِلَيَّ الْبَيْتُ الْمَعْمُور <br /> <br />Then I was taken up to <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b>, whose fruits like the clay jugs of <b>Hajar</b> (a region in Arabia) and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. <br /> <br />(Jibril) said&#59;`This is <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b>.' And there were four rivers, two hidden and two visible. <br /> <br />I said, `What is this, O Jibril' <br /> <br />He said, `The two hidden rivers are rivers in Paradise, and the two visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' <br /> <br />Then I was shown <b>Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur</b>. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan told us narrating from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet saw <b>Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur</b>. Each day seventy thousand angels enter it, then they never return from it. <br /> <br />Then he continued to narrate the <b>Hadith</b> of Anas; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أُتِيتُ بِإِنَاءٍ مِنْ خَمْرٍ وَإِنَاءٍ مِنْ لَبَنٍ وَإِنَاءٍ مِنْنَعسَلٍ <br /> <br />قَالَ فَأَخَذْتُ اللَّبَنَ قَالَ هَذِهِ الْفِطْرَةُ أَنْتَ عَلَيْهَا وَأُمَّتُكَ <br /> <br />Then I was brought a vessel of wine, a vessel of milk and a vessel of honey. <br /> <br />I chose the milk, and he (Jibril) said, `This is the <b>Fitrah</b> (natural instinct) on which you and your <b>Ummah</b> will be.' <br /> <br />قَالَ ثُمَّ فُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الصَّلَاةُ خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً كُلَّ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />Then the prayer was enjoined upon me, fifty prayers each day. <br /> <br />قَالَ فَنَزَلْتُ حَتَّى أَتَيْتُ مُوسَى فَقَالَ مَا فَرَضَ رَبُّكَ عَلَى أُمَّتِكَ <br /> <br />I came down until I reached Musa, who said, `What did your Lord enjoin upon your <b>Ummah</b>?' <br /> <br />قَالَ فَقُلْتُ خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً كُلَّ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />I said, `Fifty prayers each day.' <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَاا تَسْتَطِيعُ خَمْسِينَ صَلَاةً وَإِنِّي قَدْ خَبَرْتُ النَّاسَ قَبْلَكَ وَعَالَجْتُ بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ أَشَدَّ الْمُعَالَجَةِ فَارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ التَّخْفِيفَ لاِاُمَّتِكَ <br /> <br />He said, `Your <b>Ummah</b> will not be able to do fifty prayers each day. I tried the people before you, I had to deal with the Children of Israel and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the burden on your <b>Ummah</b>.' <br /> <br />قَالَ فَرَجَعْتُ فَوَضَعَ عَنِّي عَشْرًا <br />فَاسْأَلْهُ التَّخْفِيفَ لاِاُمَّتِكَ <br /> <br /> <br />So I went back, and the number was reduced by ten. I came back to Musa and he asked, `What were you commanded to do?' <br /> <br />I said, `Forty prayers each day.' <br /> <br />He said, `Your <b>Ummah</b> will not be able to do forty prayers each day.

Then he brought a vessel of gold filled with wisdom and faith, and poured it into my chest, then he closed it up. Then he took me by the hand and took me up to the lowest heaven. <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جِيْتُ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ لِخَازِنِ السَّمَاءِ افْتَحْ <br /> <br />قَالَ مَنْ هَذَا <br /> <br />قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ <br /> <br />قَالَ هَلْ مَعَكَ أَحَدٌ <br /> <br />قَالَ نَعَمْ مَعِيَ مُحَمَّدٌ <br /> <br />صلى الله عليه وسلّم <br /> <br /> <br />فَقَالَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br /> <br />قَالَ نَعَمْ <br /> <br /> <br />When we came to the lowest heaven, Jibril said to its keeper, `Open up!' <br /> <br />He said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Jibril.' <br /> <br />He said, `Is there anyone with you?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes, Muhammad is with me.' <br /> <br />He said, `Has his Mission started?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا فَتَحَ عَلَوْنَا السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا فَإِذَا رَجُلٌ قَاعِدٌ عَلَى يَمِينِهِ أَسْوِدَةٌ وَعَلَى يَسَارِهِ أَسْوِدَةٌ إِذَا نَظَرَ قِبَلَ يَمِينِهِ ضَحِكَ وَإِذَا نَظَرَ قِبَلَ شِمَالِهِ بَكَى <br /> <br /> <br />When it was opened, we went up into the first heaven, where I saw a man sitting with a multitude to his right and another to his left. When he looked to his right he smiled, and when he looked to his left, he wept. <br /> <br />فَقَالَ مَرْحَبًا بِالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ وَالاْبْنِ الصَّالِحِ <br /> <br /> <br />He said, `Welcome to the righteous Prophet and the righteous son.' <br /> <br />قَالَ قُلْتُ لِجِبْرِيلَ مَنْ هَذَا <br /> <br /> <br />قَالَ هَذَا ادَمُ وَهَذِهِ الاْاَسْوِدَةُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ وَعَنْ شِمَالِهِ نَسَمُ بَنِيهِ فَأَهْلُ الْيَمِينِ مِنْهُمْ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ وَالاْاَسْوِدَةُ الَّتِي عَنْ شِمَالِهِ أَهْلُ النَّارِ فَإِذَا نَظَرَ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ ضَحِكَ وَإِذَا نَظَرَ عَنْ شِمَالِهِ بَكَى <br /> <br /> <br />I said to Jibril, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `This is Adam, and these multitudes to his right and left are the souls of his descendants. The people on his right include the people of Paradise, and the people on his left include the people of Hell, so when he looks to his right he smiles, and when he looks to his left he weeps.' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ عَرَجَ بِي إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الثَّانِيَة <br /> <br /> <br />Then he took me up to the second heaven... <br /> Then we passed by Ibrahim, who said, `Welcome to the righteous Prophet and the righteous son.' <br /> <br />قُلْتُ مَنْ هَذَا قَالَ هَذَا إِبْرَاهِيم <br /> <br /> <br />I said, `Who is this?' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ مَرَرْتُ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ <br /> <br /> <br />He said, `This is Ibrahim.' <br /> <br />فَقَالَ مَرْحبًا بِالنَّبِيِّ الصَّالِحِ وَالاْبْنِ الصَّالِحِ <br /> <br /> <br />He said, `Welcome to the righteous Prophet and the righteous son.' <br /> <br />Az-Zuhri said&#59;Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn Abbas and Abu Habbah Al-Ansari used to say&#59; <br /> <br />the Prophet narrated here - <br /> <br />ثُمَّ عُرِجَ بِي حَتَّى ظَهَرْتُ لِمُسْتَوًى أَسْمَعُ فِيهِ صَرِيفَ الاَْقْلَم <br /> <br />Then I was taken up until I reached a level where I could hear the sound of the pens. <br /> <br />Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said&#59;the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَفَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَى أُمَّتِي خَمْسِينَ صَلَةً <br /> <br />Allah enjoined upon my <b>Ummah</b> fifty prayers. <br /> <br />فَرَجَعْتُ بِذَلِكَ حَتَّى مَرَرْتُ عَلَى مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ فَقَالَ مَا فَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَى أُمَّتِكَ <br /> <br />I came back with this (message) until I passed by Musa, who said, `What did your Lord enjoin upon your <b>Ummah</b>?' <br /> <br />قُلْتُ فَرَضَ خَمْسِينَ صَلَةً <br /> <br />I said, `He enjoined fifty prayers.' <br /> <br />قَالَ مُوسَى فَارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَاا تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ <br /> <br />Musa said, `Go back to your Lord, for your <b>Ummah</b> will not be able to do that.' <br /> <br />فَرَجَعْتُ فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا <br />فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَاإ تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ <br /> <br />So I went back, and He reduced it by half. <br /> <br />Then I came back to Musa and said, `It has been reduced by half.' <br /> <br />He said, `Go back to your Lord, for your <b>Ummah</b> will not be able to do that.' <br /> <br />فَرَجَعْتُ فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا... <br />فَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكَ لَاإ تُطِيقُ ذَلِكَ <br /> <br /> <br />So I went back, and it was reduced by half. <br /> <br />I came back to him, and he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your <b>Ummah</b> will not be able to do that.' <br /> <br />فَرَاجَعْتُهُ فَقَالَ هِيَ خَمْسٌ وَهِيَ خَمْسُونَ لَا يُبَدَّلُ الْقَوْلُ لَدَيَّ <br /> <br />So I went back, and He said&#59;`They are five but equal in reward to fifty, for My word does not change.' <br /> <br />فَرَجَعْتُ إِلَى مُوسَى فَقَالَ ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ <br /> <br />I came back to Musa and he said, `Go back to your Lord.' <br /> <br />قُلْتُ قَدِ اسْتَحْيَيْتُ مِنْ رَبِّي <br /> <br />I said, `I feel too shy before my Lord.' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ بِي حَتَّى انْتَهَى إِلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى فَغَشِيَهَا أَلْوَانٌ لَا أَدْرِي مَااِهيَ ثُمَّ أُدْخِلْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَإِذَا فِيهَا حَبَايِلُ اللُّوْلُوِ وَإِذَا تُرَابُهَا الْمِسْك <br /> <br />Then I was taken up until I reached <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b>, which was veiled in indescribable colors. Then I entered Paradise, in which I saw nets of pearls and its soil of musk. <br /> <br />This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Prayer. <br /> <br />He also reported in the Book of Tafsir, under the discussion of <b>Bani Isra'il</b> (i.e., Surah <b>Al-Isra'</b>), the Book of <b>Hajj</b> and the Stories of the Prophets, via different chains of narration from Yunus. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded similar <b>Hadiths</b> in his <b>Sahih</b> in the Book of Faith. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Shaqiq said&#59; <br /> <br />I said to Abu Dharr, &#34;If I had seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;What would you have asked him?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I would have asked him, if he saw his Lord?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I did ask him that, and he said, <br /> <br />قَدْ رَأَيْتُهُ نُورًا أَنَّى أَرَاه <br /> <br />I saw it as light, how could I see Him!&#34; <br /> <br />This is how it was narrated in the report of Imam Ahmad. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abdullah bin Shaqiq said that Abu Dharr said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;I asked the Messenger of Allah, `Did you see your Lord?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه <br /> <br />(I saw) a light, how could I see Him?&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Shaqiq said&#59;I said to Abu Dharr, &#34;If I had seen the Messenger of Allah, I would have asked him.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;What would you have asked him?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I would have asked him, `Did you see your Lord?&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dharr said, &#34;I asked him that, and he said, <br /> <br />رَأَيْتُ نُورًا <br /> <br />I saw light. <br /><b>The Report of Jabir bin Abdullah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say&#59; <br /> <br />لَمَّا كَذَّبَتْنِي قُرَيْشٌ حِينَ أُسْرِيَ بِي إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِسِ قُمْتُ فِي الْحِجْرِ فَجَلَى اللهُ لِي بَيْتَ الْمَقْدِسِ فَطَفِقْتُ أُخْبِرُهُمْ عَنْ ايَاتِهِ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْه <br /> <br />When Quraysh did not believe that I had been taken on the Night Journey to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>, I stood up in <b>Al-Hijr</b> and Allah displayed <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> before me, so I told them about its features while I was looking at it. <br /> <br />This was also reported in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> with different chains of narration. <br /> <br />According to Al-Bayhaqi, Ibn Shihab said that Abu Salamah bin Abdur-Rahman said&#59; <br /> <br />Some people from Quraish went to Abu Bakr and said, &#34;Have you heard what your companion is saying He is claiming that he went to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> and came back to Makkah in one night!&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr said, &#34;Did he say that!&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr said, &#34;Then I bear witness that if he said that, he is speaking the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;You believe that he went to Ash-Sham (Greater Syria) in one night and came back to Makkah before morning!&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Yes, I believe him with regard to something even more than that. I believe him with regard to the revelation that comes to him from heaven.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Salamah said, from then on Abu Bakr was known as As-Siddiq (the true believer). <br /><b>The Report of Abdullah bin Abbas</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;On the night when the Messenger of Allah was taken on his Night Journey, he entered Paradise, in some part of which he heard a sound. <br /> <br />He said, `O Jibril, what is this?' <br /> <br />He said, `This is Bilal, the <b>Mu'adhdhin</b>.' <br /> <br />When the Prophet came back to the people, he said, <br /> <br />قَدْ أَفْلَحَ بِلَلٌ رَأَيْتُ لَهُ كَذَا وَكَذَا <br /> <br />Bilal has succeeded, I saw that he will have such and such. <br /> <br />He (the Prophet) was met by Musa, who welcomed him and said, `Welcome to the Unlettered Prophet.' <br /> <br />He was a tall, dark man with lank hair coming down to his ears or above his ears. <br /> <br />He said, `Who is this, O Jibril!' <br /> <br />He said, `This is Musa.' <br /> <br />Then he went on and met a venerable, distinguished old man, who welcomed him and greeted him with <b>Salam</b>, and all of them were greeting him. He said, `Who is this?, O Jibril!' <br /> <br />He said, `This is your father Ibrahim.' <br /> <br />Then he looked into Hell and saw some people eating rotten meat. He said, `Who are these people, O Jibril!' <br /> <br />He said, `They are those who used to eat the flesh of the people (i.e., backbiting).' <br /> <br />He saw a man who was very red and dark blue, and said, `Who is this, O Jibril!' <br /> <br />He said, `This is the one who slaughtered the she-camel (of Salih).' <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah came to <b>Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa</b>, he stood up to pray, and all the Prophets gathered and prayed with him. When he finished, he was brought two cups, one on his right and one on his left, one containing milk and one containing honey. He took the milk and drank it, and the one who was carrying the cup said, `You have chosen the <b>Fitrah</b> (natural instinct).&#34;' <br /> <br />The chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>, although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad reported that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah was taken on the Night Journey to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>, then he came back and told them about his journey and the features of <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> and the caravan (of Quraysh). <br /> <br />Some people said, `We do not believe what Muhammad is saying,' and they left Islam and became disbelievers. Allah destroyed them when He destroyed Abu Jahl. <br /> <br />Abu Jahl said&#59;`Muhammad is trying to scare us with the tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>; bring some dates and butter and let us have some <b>Zaqqum</b>!' <br /> <br />The Prophet also saw the <b>Dajjal</b> in his true form, in real life, not in a dream, and he saw `Isa, Musa and Ibrahim. <br /> <br />The Prophet was asked about the <b>Dajjal</b>, and he said&#59; <br /> <br />رَأَيْتُهُ فَيلَمَانِيًا أَقْمَرَ هِجَانًا إِحْدَى عَيْنَيْهِ قَايِمَةٌ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ كَأَنَّ شَعْرَ رَأْسِهِ أَغْصَانُ شَجَرَةٍ <br /> <br />I saw him as a tall and huge man, with a whitish complexion. One of his eyes stood out like a shining star. The hair on his head looked like the branches of a tree. <br /> <br />وَرَأَيْتُ عِيسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ شابًّا أَبْيَضَ جَعْدَ الرَّأْسِ حَدِيدَ الْبَصَرِ وَمُبَطَّنَ الْخَلْقِ <br /> <br />And I saw `Isa, white with curly hair and an intense gaze, of average build. <br /> <br />وَرَأَيْتُ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ أَسْحَمَ ادَمَ كَثِيرَ الشَّعْرِ شَدِيدَ الْخَلْقِ <br /> <br />I saw Musa, dark-skinned, with a lot of hair and a strong build. <br /> <br />وَنَظَرْتُ إِلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ فَلَمْ أَنْظُرْ إِلَى إِرْبٍ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ نَظَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ مِنِّي حَتَّى كَأَنَّهُ صَاحِبُكُمْ <br /> <br />قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ سَلِّمْ عَلَى أَبِيكَ فَسَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْه <br /> <br />I looked at Ibrahim and did not see anything in him that I do not see in myself; it is as if he were your companion (meaning himself). <br /> <br />Jibril said&#59;`Greet your father with <b>Salam</b>,' so I greeted him with <b>Salam</b>. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i from the <b>Hadith</b> of Abu Zayd Thabit bin Yazid from Hilal, who is Ibn Khabbab, and it is a <b>Sahih</b> chain of narrators. <br /> <br />Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Abu Al-Aliyah said&#59;&#34;The cousin of your Prophet, Ibn Abbas narrated to us from the Messenger of Allah, he said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي مُوسَى بْنَ عِمْرَانَ رَجُلًأ طُوَالاًأ جَعْدًا كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ وَرَأَيْتُ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَأمُ مَرْبُوعَ الْخَلْقِ إِلَى الْحُمْرَةِ وَالْبَيَاضِ سَبْطَ الرَّأس <br /> <br />On the night when I was taken on the Night Journey, I saw Musa bin Imran, a tall, curly-haired man, as if he was from the tribe of Shanu'ah. And I saw `Isa bin Maryam, of medium stature, white with a reddish complexion, with straight hair. <br /> <br />And he was shown <b>Malik</b>, the keeper of Hell, and the <b>Dajjal</b>, with the signs that Allah revealed to him.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />فَلَ تَكُن فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَأيِهِ <br /> <br />So be not you in doubt of meeting him. (32&#59;33) <br /> <br />Qatadah used to interpret this to mean that the Prophet of Allah met Musa. <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَاهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ <br /> <br />And We made it (or him) a guide to the Children of Israel. (32&#59;33) <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;(This means) Allah made Musa a guide for the Children of Israel.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim reported this in his <b>Sahih</b>, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded a shorter version from Qatadah. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَمَّا كَانَ لَيْلَةَ أُسْرِيَ بِي فَأَصْبَحْتُ بِمَكَّةَ فَظِعْتُ وَعَرَفْتُ أَنَّ النَّاسَ مُكَذِّبِي <br /> <br />On the night when I was taken on the Night Journey, I woke up in Makkah the next morning having anxiety that, I knew that the people would not believe me. <br /> <br />He kept away from people, feeling anxious and sad, then the enemy of Allah Abu Jahl passed by him and came to sit with him, saying mockingly, `Is there anything new!' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br />نَعَم <br /> (Yes). <br /> <br />He said, `What is it?' <br /> <br />He said, <br />إِنِّي أُسْرِيَ بِي اللَّيْلَة <br /> (I was taken on a Journey last night). <br /> <br />He said, `Where to?' <br /> <br />He said, <br />إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِس <br /> (To <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>). <br /> <br />He said, `Then this morning you were among us!' <br /> <br />He said, <br />نَعَم <br /> (Yes). <br /> <br />Abu Jahl did not want to say to his face that he was lying, lest he deny saying it when he called other people to hear him, so he said&#59;`Do you think that if I call your people, you will tell them about what happened!' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br />نَعَم <br /> (Yes). <br /> <br />Abu Jahl said, `O people of Bani Ka`b bin Lu'ay!' <br /> <br />People got up from where they were sitting and came to join them. <br /> <br />Abu Jahl said, `Tell your people what you told me.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br />إِنِّي أُسْرِيَ بِي اللَّيْلَة <br /> (I was taken on a Journey last night). <br /> <br />They said, `Where to!' <br /> <br />He said, <br />إِلَى بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِس <br /> (To <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>). <br /> <br />They said, `Then this morning you were among us!' <br /> <br />He said, <br />نَعَم <br /> (Yes). <br /> <br />They began to clap their hands together and put their hands on their heads in astonishment at this &#34;lie&#34; - as they claimed it to be. <br /> <br />They said, `Can you describe the sanctuary to us!' <br /> <br />Among them were some who had traveled to that land and seen the sanctuary, so the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَا زِلْتُ أَنْعَتُ حَتَّى الْتَبَسَ عَلَيَّ بَعْضُ النَّعْتِ قَالَ فَجِيءَ بِالْمَسْجِدِ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى وُضِعَ دُونَ دَارِ عُقَيلٍ أَوْ عِقَالٍ فَنَعَتُّهُ وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />قَالَ وَكَانَ مَعَ هَذَا نَعْتٌ لَمْ أَحْفَظْهُ <br /> <br />قَالَ فَقَالَ الْقَوْمُ أَمَّا النَّعْتُ فَوَاللهِ لَقَدْ أَصَابَ فِيه <br /> <br />I started to describe it, until I reached a point where I was not sure about some of the details, but then the sanctuary was brought close and placed near the house of `Uqayl - or `Iqal - so I could look at it and describe the details. <br /> <br />I could not remember those description. <br /> <br />The people said, `As for the description, by Allah he has got it right.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by An-Nasa'i and Al-Bayhaqi. <br /><b>The Report of Abdullah bin Mas`ud</b> <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi reported that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Night Journey, he went as far as <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b>, which is in the sixth heaven. Everything that ascends stops there, until it is taken from that point, and everything that comes down stops there, until it is taken from there. <br /> <br />إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى <br /> <br />When that covered <b>As-Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b> which did cover it! (53&#59;16) <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It is covered with gold butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given the five prayers and the final <b>Ayat</b> of Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>, and forgiveness was granted for major sins to those who do not associate anything in worship with Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Muslim in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /><b>The Report of Abu Hurayrah</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported in their <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Hurayrah said&#59; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />حِينَ أُسْرِيَ بِي لَقِيتُ مُوسَى عَلَيهِ السَّلَمُ <br /> <br />فَنَعَتَهُ فَإِذَا رَجُلٌ حَسِبْتُهُ قَالَ مُضْطَرِبٌ رَجِلُ الرَّأْسِ كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ <br /> <br />When I was taken on the Night Journey, I met Musa. <br /> <br />He described him as a man - I think he said - a curly-haired man, as if he were from the tribe of Shanu'ah. <br /> <br />قَالَ وَلَقِيتُ عِيسَى <br /> <br />فَنَعَتَهُ النَّبِيُّصلى الله عليه وسلّم قَالَ رَبْعَةٌ أَحْمَرُ كَأَنَّمَا خَرَجَ مِنْ دِيمَاسٍ يَعْنِي حَمَّامًا <br /> <br />And I met `Isa. <br /> <br />And the Prophet described him as being of average height, with a reddish complexion, as if he had just come out of the bath. <br /> <br />قَالَ وَلَقِيتُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَأَنَا أَشْبَهُ وَلَدِهِ بِهِ <br /> <br />And I met Ibrahim, and I am the one who resembles him most among his children. <br /> <br />قَالَ وَأُتِيتُ بِإِنَاءَيْنِ فِي أَحَدِهِمَا لَبَنٌ وَفِي الاْاخَرِ خَمْرٌ <br /> <br />قِيلَ لِي خُذْ أَيَّهُمَا شِيْتَ فَأَخَذْتُ اللَّبَنَ فَشَرِبْتُ فَقِيلَ لِي <br /> <br />I was brought two vessels, one containing milk and the other containing wine. <br /> <br />It was said to me, `Take whichever one you want.' So I took the milk and drank it, and it was said to me, <br /> <br />هُدِيتَ الْفِطْرَةَ أَوْ أَصَبْتَ الْفِطْرَةَ أَمَا إِنَّكَ لَوْ أَخَذْتَ الْخَمْرَ غَوَتْ أُمَّتُك <br /> <br />`You have been guided to the <b>Fitrah</b> - or - You have chosen the <b>Fitrah</b>. If you had chosen the wine, your <b>Ummah</b> would have gone astray.&#34;' <br /> <br />They also recorded it with another chain of narrators. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُنِي فِي الْحِجْرِ وَقُرَيْشٌ تَسْأَلُنِي عَنْ مَسْرَايَ فَسَأَلُونِي عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ مِنْ بَيْتِ الْمَقْدِسِ لَمْ أُثْبِتْهَا فَكُرِبْتُ كُرْبَةً مَا كُرِبْتُ مِثْلَهُ قَطُّ فَرَفَعَهُ اللهُ إِليَّ أَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِ مَا سَأَلُونِي عَنْ شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ أَنْبَأْتُهُمْ بِهِ <br /> <br />I remember being in <b>Al-Hijr</b>, and the Quraysh were asking me about my Night Journey. They asked me things about <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> that I was not sure of, and I felt more anxious and stressed then than I have ever felt. Then Allah raised up <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> for me to see, and there was nothing they asked me about but I told them about it. <br /> <br />وَقَدْ رَأَيْتُنِي فِي جَمَاعَةٍ مِنَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ وَإِذَا مُوسَى قَايِمٌ يُصَلِّي وَإِذَا هُوَ رَجُلٌ جَعْدٌ كَأَنَّهُ مِنْ رِجَالِ شَنُوءَةَ <br /> <br />And I remember being in a gathering of the Prophets. Musa was standing there praying, and he was a man with curly hair, as if he were one of the men of Shanu'ah. <br /> <br />وَإِذَا عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَايِمٌ يُصَلِّي أَقْرَبُ النَّاسِ شَبَهًا بِهِ عَرْوَةُ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ الثَّقَفِيُّ <br /> <br />I saw `Isa bin Maryam standing there praying, and the one who most resembles him is `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. <br /> <br />وَإِذَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ قَايِمٌ يُصَلِّي أَقْرَبُ النَّاسِ شَبَهًا بِهِ صَاحِبُكُمْ يَعْنِي نَفْسَهُ <br /> <br />And I saw Ibrahim standing there praying, and the one who most resembles him is your companion (meaning himself). <br /> <br />فَحَانَتِ الصَّلَةُ فَأَمَمْتُهُمْ فَلَمَّا فَرَغْتُ قَالَ قَايِلٌ يَا مُحَمَّدُ هَذَا مَالِكُ خَازِنُ جَهَنَّمَ فَسَلِّمْ عَلَيْهِ فَالْتَفَتُّ إِلَيْهِ فَبَدَأَنِي بِالسَّلَم <br /> <br />Then the time for prayer came, and I led them in prayer. When I finished, a voice said, `O Muhammad, this is <b>Malik</b>, the keeper of Hell,' so I turned to him, and he greeted me first.&#34; <br /><b>The Time that Isra' took place, and the Fact that it included both Body and Soul, when the Prophet was awake, not in a Dream</b> <br /> <br />Musa bin Uqbah said, narrating from Az-Zuhri&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Isra'</b> happened one year before the <b>Hijrah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the opinion of Urwah. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It happened sixteen months before the <b>Hijrah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />The truth is that the Prophet was taken on the Night Journey when he was awake, not in a dream, and he went from Makkah to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> riding on <b>Al-Buraq</b>. <br /> <br />When he reached the door of the sanctuary, he tied up his animal by the door and entered, where he prayed two <b>Rak`ahs</b> to `greet the <b>Masjid</b>'. <br /> <br />Then the <b>Mi`raj</b> was brought to him, which is a ladder with steps which one climbs up. So he went up on it to the first heaven, then he went up to the rest of the seven heavens. <br /> <br />In each heaven he was welcomed by the most pious of its inhabitants, and he greeted the Prophets who were in the various heavens according to their positions and status. <br /> <br />He passed by Musa, the one who spoke with Allah, in the sixth heaven, and Ibrahim, the close friend (<b>Khalil</b>) of Allah in the seventh heaven. <br /> <br />Then he surpassed them and all the Prophets in status and reached a level where he could hear the creaking of the pens, i.e., the pens of destiny which write down what is decreed to happen. <br /> <br />He saw <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b>, covered by the command of Allah, and its greatness, its butterflies of gold and various colors, surrounded by the angels. There he saw Jibril in his real form, with six hundred wings. <br /> <br />He saw green cushions blocking the horizon. He saw <b>Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur</b>, and Ibrahim <b>Al-Khalil</b>, the builder of the earthly <b>Ka`bah</b>, leaning back against it, the heavenly <b>Ka`bah</b>; every day, seventy thousand angels enter and worship therein, then they do not return to it until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />He saw Paradise and Hell, and Allah enjoined upon him fifty prayers, then reduced it to five, as an act of mercy and kindness towards His servants. In this is a strong indication of the greatness and virtue of the prayers. <br /> <br />Then he came back down to <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>, and the Prophets came down with him and he led them in prayer there when the time for prayer came. It may have been the dawn prayer of that day. <br /> <br />Some people claim that he led them in prayer in heaven, but the reports seem to say that it was in <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>. <br /> <br />In some reports it says that it happened when he first entered (i.e., before ascending into the heavens), but it is more likely that it was after he came back, because when he passed by them in the places in the heavens, he asked Jibril about them, one by one, and Jibril told him about them. This is more appropriate, because he was first required to come before the Divine Presence, so that what Allah willed could be enjoined upon him and his <b>Ummah</b>. When the matter for which he was required had been dealt with, he and his brother-Prophets gathered, and his virtue and high position in relation to them became apparent when he was asked to come forward to lead them, which was when Jibril indicated to him that he should do so. <br /> <br />Then he came out of <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> and rode on <b>Al-Buraq</b> back to Makkah in the darkness of the night. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />As for his being presented with the vessels containing milk and honey, or milk and wine, or milk and water, or all of these, some reports say that this happened in <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>, and others say that it happened in the heavens. It is possible that it happened in both places, because it is like offering food or drink to a guest when he arrives, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />The Prophet was taken on the Night Journey with body and soul, he was awake, not asleep. The evidence for this is the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الَاقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ <br /> <br />Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) Who took His servant for a Journey by Night from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> to <b>Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa</b>, the neighborhood whereof We have blessed, <br /> <br />The words &#34;<b>Subhan Allah</b>&#34; (Glorified and exalted be Allah) are spoken in the case of serious matters. If it had been a dream, it would have been a significant matter and would not have been so astounding; the disbelievers of the Quraysh would not have hastened to label him a liar and the group of people who had become Muslims would not have deserted the faith. <br /> <br />The word <b>`Abd</b> (servant) refers to both soul and body. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلً <br /> <br />took His servant for a Journey by Night. <br /> <br />and&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّءْيَا الَّتِى أَرَيْنَـكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And We made not the vision which we showed you but a trial for mankind. (17&#59;60) <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This is the vision that the Messenger of Allah saw with his own eyes during the Journey by Night, and the cursed tree is the tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى <br /> <br />The sight (of Prophet Muhammad) turned not aside (right or left), nor it transgressed beyond the limit (ordained for it). (53&#59;17) <br /> <br />Sight (<b>Al-Basr</b>) is a physical faculty, not a spiritual one, and he was carried on <b>Al-Buraq</b>, a shining white animal. This too indicates a physical journey, because the soul does not need a means of transportation of this nature. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best. <br /><b>An Interesting Story</b> <br /> <br />In his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, Al-Hafiz Abu Nu`aym Al-Isbahani recorded via Muhammad bin Umar Al-Waqidi who said&#59; <br /> <br />Malik bin Abi Ar-Rijjal told me from Amr bin Abdullah that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah sent Dihyah bin Khalifah to Caesar.&#34; <br /> <br />He mentioned how he came to him, and described an incident that showed how wise Caesar was. <br /> <br />He sent for the Arab merchants who were in Syria and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and his companions were brought to him. He asked them the well-known questions that were recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, as we shall discuss below, and Abu Sufyan tried hard to give the impression that this was an insignificant issue. <br /> <br />(The narrator) said that Abu Sufyan (later) said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah, nothing stopped me from saying something to Heraclius to make him despise (Muhammad) but the fact that I did not want to tell a lie that would later be found out, and he would never believe me again after that. <br /> <br />Then I told him about the night on which he was taken on the Night Journey. <br /> <br />I said&#59;`O King, shall I not tell you of something from which you will know that he is lying!' <br /> <br />He said, `What is it?' <br /> <br />I said&#59;`He claims that he went out of our land, the land of Al-Haram, in one night, and came to your sanctuary in Jerusalem, then came back to us the same night, before morning came.' <br /> <br />The Patriarch of Jerusalem was there, standing next to Caesar. <br /> <br />The Patriarch of Jerusalem said&#59;`I know that night.' <br /> <br />Caesar looked at him and said, `How do you know about this!' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />`I never used to sleep at night until I closed the doors of the sanctuary. On that night I closed all the doors except for one, which I could not manage to close. I asked my workers and others who were with me to help me deal with it, but we could not move it. It was like trying to move a mountain. So I called the carpenters, and they looked at it and said&#59;The lintel and some part of the structure has fallen onto it. We cannot move it until morning, when we will be able to see what the problem is. So I went back and left those two doors open. <br /> <br />The next morning I went back, and saw that the stone at the corner of the sanctuary had a hole in it, and there were traces of an animal having been tethered there. <br /> <br />I said to my companions&#59;This door has not been closed last night except for a Prophet, who prayed last night in our sanctuary.&#34;' <br /> <br />And he mentioned the rest of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In his book At-Tanwir fi Mawlid As-Siraj Al-Munir, Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Khattab Umar bin Dihyah mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> of the Isra' narrated from Anas, and spoke well about it, then he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The reports of the <b>Hadith</b> of the <b>Isra</b>' reach the level of <b>Mutawatir</b>. <br /> <br />They were narrated from; <br /> <br />Umar bin Al-Khattab, <br /> <br />Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, <br /> <br />Abu Dharr, <br /> <br />Malik bin Sa`sa`ah, <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah, <br /> <br />Abu Sa`id, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />Shaddad bin Aws, <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b, <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Qarat, <br /> <br />Abu Habbah Al-Ansari, <br /> <br />Abu Layla Al-Ansari, <br /> <br />Abdullah bin `Amr, <br /> <br />Jabir, Hudhayfah, <br /> <br />Buraydah, <br /> <br />Abu Ayub, <br /> <br />Abu Umamah, <br /> <br />Samurah bin Jundub, <br /> <br />Abu Al-Hamra', <br /> <br />Suhayb Ar-Rumi, <br /> <br />Umm Hani', and <br /> <br />A'ishah and Asma', the daughters of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, <br /> <br />may Allah be pleased with them all. <br /> <br />Some of them narrated the incident at length, and others narrated it more briefly, as was reported in the <b>Musnad</b> collections. <br /> <br />Even though some reports do not fulfill the conditions of <b>Sahih</b>, nevertheless the Muslims agreed unanimously on the fact that the <b>Isra'</b> happened, and it was rejected only by the heretics and apostates. <br /> <br />يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِيُواْ نُورَ اللَّهِ بِأَفْوَهِهِمْ وَاللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَـفِرُونَ <br /> <br />They intend to put out the Light of Allah with their mouths. But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it).
