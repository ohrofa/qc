And Satan promises them, thereby, nothing but delusion, falsehood.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُمْ بِصَوْتِكَ <br /> <br />And fool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice, <br /> <br />It was said that this refers to singing. <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;With idle entertainment and singing,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, influence them with that. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Every caller who calls people to disobey Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was the view of Qatadah, and was also the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ <br /><b>Ajib</b> upon them with your cavalry and your infantry. <br /> <br />Send your troops and cavalry and infantry against them. <br /> <br />The meaning is, send whatever forces you have at your disposal against them. <br /> <br />This is a command (related to the divine decree), as Allah says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّأ أَرْسَلْنَا الشَّيَـطِينَ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ تَوُزُّهُمْ أَزّاً <br /> <br />See you not that We have sent the <b>Shayatin</b> against the disbelievers to push them to do evil. (19&#59;83), <br /> <br />meaning, to provoke them and drive them towards evil. <br /> <br />وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ <br /><b>Ajlib</b> upon them with your cavalry and your infantry, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Everyone who rides or walks to go and commit sin and disobey Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;He has infantry and cavalry among the Jinn and among humans. They are the ones who obey him.&#34; <br /> <br />The Arabs use the verb <b>Ajlaba</b> when describing somebody shouting at another person. Hence it is forbidden in races to shout at one another and push one another. <br /> <br />From this root is also derived the word <b>Jalabah</b>, which means raising voices. <br /> <br />وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الَامْوَالِ وَالَاوْلادِ <br /> <br />and share with them wealth and children, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means what he commands them to do of spending money in disobedience to Allah, may He be exalted.&#34; <br /> <br />وَالَاوْلادِ <br /> <br />and children, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, as reported by Al-Awfi, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means the children of <b>Zina</b> (i.e., illegitimate children).&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means the children whom they used to kill out of folly, without knowledge.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah reported that Al-Hasan Al-Basri said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Allah caused <b>Shaytan</b> to take a share of wealth and children by making them <b>Magians</b>, Jews and Christians, and making them follow any religion other than Islam, and by making them give a part of their wealth to the <b>Shaytan</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said the same. <br /> <br />وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الَامْوَالِ وَالَاوْلادِ <br /> <br />and share with them wealth and children. <br /> <br />The fact that only wealth and children are mentioned in this <b>Ayah</b>, does not mean that it is limited only to those things. Everything in which a person disobeys Allah or obeys the <b>Shaytan</b> means that he is sharing with him. <br /> <br />It was reported in <b>Sahih</b> Muslim from Iyad bin Himar that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ <br /> <br />إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِمْ وَحَرَّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَا أَحْلَلْتُ لَهُم <br /> <br />Allah the Mighty and Exalted says, <br /> <br />&#34;I have created My servants as <b>Hunafa</b>' (monotheists), then the <b>Shayatin</b> come to them and lead them astray from their religion and (tell that) what I have permitted for them is forbidden to them.&#34; <br /> <br />According to the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَهُمْ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَهْلَهُ قَالَ <br /> <br />بِسْمِ اللهِ اللَّهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا فَإِنَّهُ إِنْ يُقَدَّرْ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَدٌ فِي ذَلِكَ لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَبَدًا <br /> <br />When one of you wants to have intercourse with his wife, let him say, <br /> <br />`In the Name of Allah. O Allah, keep us away from <b>Shaytan</b> and keep <b>Shaytan</b> away from what you bestow on us (children).' <br /> <br />Then if a child is decreed for them from that, the <b>Shaytan</b> will never harm him. <br /> <br />وَعِدْهُمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلاَّ غُرُورًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;...and make promises to them.&#34; But <b>Shaytan</b> promises them nothing but deceit. <br /> <br />As Allah tells us, Iblis will say, on the Day when the matter is decided&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you.
