And We did not appoint the vision that We showed you, before your very eyes, during the Night Journey, except as a test for people, [for] the people of Mecca -- since they denied it and some of them [even] apostatised when he [the Prophet] informed them of it -- and [likewise] the tree cursed in the Qur'n, namely, the [tree called] Zaqqm [Q.37&#59;62ff] that issues from the very root of the Blazing Fire [of Hell]; We made it a test for them, because they said, `Fire consumes trees, so how can it cause it [the Zaqqm tree] to issue forth?'. And We [seek to] deter them, with it, but it, Our deterrence, only increases them in gross insolence.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Allah has encompassed Mankind and made the Vision of His Prophet a Trial for Them</b> <br /> <br />Allah says to His Messenger, encouraging him to convey the Message and informing him that He is protecting him from the people, that He is able to deal with them and that they are in His grasp and under His domination and control. <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِالنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And (remember) when We told you&#59;&#34;Verily, your Lord has encompassed mankind..&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid, Urwah bin Az-Az-Zubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means, He protected you from them.&#34; <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّويَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And We made not the vision which We showed you but a trial for mankind, <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This is the vision which the Messenger of Allah saw with his own eyes on the night when he was taken on the Night Journey (<b>Al-Isra'</b>). <br /> <br />وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي القُرْانِ <br /> <br />and (likewise) the accursed tree in the Quran. <br /> <br />refers to the Tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Ahmad, Abdur-Razzaq and others. <br /> <br />It was also reported by Al-Awfi from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />It was also interpreted as referring to the Night of the <b>Isra'</b> by Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Masruq, Ibrahim, Qatadah, Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd and several others. <br /> <br />We have already quoted at length a comprehensive collection of <b>Hadith</b> about the <b>Isra'</b> at the beginning of this Surah, praise be to Allah. We have also already stated that some people gave up their Islam after they had been following the truth, because their hearts and minds could not comprehend that, and they denied what their knowledge could not grasp, but Allah caused it to increase and strengthen the faith of others, and so He says&#59; <br />إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً <br /> (but a trial), meaning a test. <br /> <br />As for the cursed tree, this is the Tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>. <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah told them that he had seen Paradise and Hell, and seen the Tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>, they did not believe that, and Abu Jahl, upon whom be the curses of Allah, even said, <br /> <br />&#34;Bring us some dates and butter,&#34; and he started eating them and saying, &#34;Let us have some <b>Zaqqum</b>, we don't know any other <b>Zaqqum</b> but this.&#34; <br /> <br />This was narrated by Ibn Abbas, Masruq, Abu Malik, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others. <br /> <br />Everyone who interpreted the <b>Ayah</b> to refer to the Night of the <b>Isra'</b>, also interpreted it to refer to the Tree of <b>Zaqqum</b>. <br /> <br />وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ <br /> <br />(We) make them afraid, <br /> <br />meaning, `We make the disbelievers afraid with Our warnings and punishments and torment.' <br /> <br />فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah. <br /> <br />means, it only pushes them further into their disbelief and misguidance, and this is because Allah has forsaken them</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 59" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الإسراء<span class="num-ar">17</span> :<span class="num-ar">60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Isra'<span> 17</span>:<span>60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Bani Isra'eel, Subhan</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 61" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
