The arrangement whereby `praise' is [invoked] together with this [statement] is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise, because of the perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad [b. Hanbal] relates in his Musnad [by way of a report] from Mu`dh al-Juhan [who heard it] from the Messenger of God (s), who used to say, `The &#34;glory&#34; verse [in the Qur'n] is&#59; Praise be to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty ... to the end [of the above-mentioned sra, 17&#59;111]', and God, exalted be He, knows best. The author of this [commentary] says, `This [last commentary] constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur'n composed by the inquisitive scholar, the shaykh, Imam Jall al-Dn al- Mahall al-Shfi`, may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively, [especially] in those precious things that I have deemed, God willing, to be profitable. I composed it [this commentary] in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God [sc. Moses] and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It [this commentary] actually draws on the work which it complements, relying and depending on it for [an understanding of] those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality, chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said&#59; &#34;I praise God, my Lord, for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who [other than God] is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter&#34;. In fact, it never occurred to me to embark upon such [a task], knowing that I was incapable of delving into such issues. Perhaps God will make it of ample profit [to others] and through it open sealed hearts, blinded eyes and deaf ears. I have the impression that I am before those [sort of readers] who would prefer works of prolixity, refraining from [referring to] this complementary work, rejecting it outright, tending to obvious obstinacy [regarding it], without addressing its intricacies with any understanding&#59; And whoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter [Q. 17&#59;72]. May God thereby provide us with a [way of] guidance to the path of truth, with success, an awareness of the subtle intricacies of His words and with an ascertainment. May He thereby also make us with those to whom God has been gracious from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous -- and excellent companions are they! [Q. 4&#59;69]. He [Jall al-Dn al-Suyt] completed the composition of this [work] on Sunday, 10th of Shawwl, in the year 870 (AH) [1465 AD], having commenced it on the first Wednesday of Ramadn of the same year. He completed the fair copy [of this work] on Wednesday, 6th of Safar in the year 871 (AH) [1466 AD], and God knows best. Shaykh Shams al-Dn Muhammad b. Ab Bakr al-Khatb al-Tkh said&#59; my friend the erudite shaykh Kaml al-Dn al-Mahall, brother of the above-mentioned shaykh of ours, shaykh Jall al-Dn al- Mahall, may God have mercy on both of them, that he saw his brother, the above-mentioned shaykh Jall al-Dn, in his dream&#59; before him stood our friend the inquiring erudite scholar shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Suyt, compiler of this complement. He [Mahall] had this complement in his hand and, perusing it, he was saying to its above-mentioned compiler [Suyt], `Which of the two is better, my composition or yours?'. He [Suyt] said, `Mine'. He [Mahall] then said, `But look at this ...', and he showed him parts of it, politely pointing out to him his objections thereto. Each time he [Mahall] brought something up, the compiler of this complement [Suyt] would respond to him, while shaykh [Mahall] would smile and laugh. Our shaykh, the imam, the erudite scholar Jall al-Dn `Abd al-Rahmn b. Ab Bakr al-Suyt, compiler of this complement said&#59; What I believe, and what I am absolutely certain of, is that the part composed by shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Mahall, may God have mercy on him, in his section [of the commentary] is actually better than mine by far. How [could it be otherwise], when most of what I have written here draws on his work and relies on it? I have no doubt about this. As regards what was seen in the above-mentioned dream, then perhaps it is the case that the shaykh meant to point out those few places in which I disagreed with what he had written on account of some little comment [that I had made therein]. But these [instances] are very few and I do not think that they add up to more than ten such instances. Among these is where shaykh [al-Mahall] comments in srat Sd&#59; `The Spirit is a delicate organism (jism latf) that gives life to a human being by permeating it'. I followed this [opinion] at first, but then I remembered the restriction [made by God] while [working on the commentary] at srat al-Hijr; and so I erased it because of where God says, And they will question you concerning the Spirit. Say, `The Spirit is of the command of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little [...]' [to the end of] the verse [Q. 15&#59;85]. For, it is explicit, or almost explicit, in stating that the [true nature of the] Spirit is of God's knowledge [only], exalted be He -- we do not know it. Thus, it is better that we should refrain from trying to define it. For this reason also, shaykh Tj al-Dn b. al-Subk says in [his work] Jam` al-jawmi` (The compendium of compendiums')&#59; `As for the spirit, Muhammad (s) never spoke about it and we should [also] therefore refrain [from speaking about it].' Another [instance] is where the shaykh says in [his commentary to] srat al-Hajj [Q. 22&#59;17], `The Sabaeans (al-sbi'n) are a Jewish sect'. I mention this in [my commentary to] srat al-Baqara [Q. 2&#59;62], where I added the following [gloss] `or [they are] a Christian [sect]', in order to point out a variant opinion, generally acknowledged, particularly by our colleagues, the [Shfi`] jurists, and [also acknowledged] by the Minhj (`The Method [...]'), where it is stated that the Samaritans opposed the Jews and the Sabaeans [opposed] the Christians [respectively] over the fundamentals of their religion. In his [Mahall's] Sharh (`Commentary'), al-Shfi`, may God be pleased with him, is reported to have said that the Sabaeans were a Christian sect. At this moment, I cannot recall a third instance [of Mahall's objections]. Perhaps these are the sort of examples which the Shaykh, may God have mercy on him, was pointing out [in the dream]. And God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the return and the [final] resort. Meccan, except for verses 28, and from [verses] 82 to the end of 101, which are Medinese; it consists of 110 or 115 verses, revealed after srat al-Ghshiya.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا <br /> <br />And say&#59;&#34;All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has not begotten a son...&#34; <br /> <br />because Allah has stated that the Most Beautiful Names belong to Him, and has declared Himself to be above having any faults or defects. <br /> <br />وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَم يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ <br /> <br />And say&#59;&#34;All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has not begotten a son, and Who has no partner in (His) dominion...&#34; <br /> <br />indeed, He is Allah, (the) One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who begets not, nor was He begotten, and there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him. <br /> <br />وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلَّ <br /> <br />nor He is low to have a supporter. <br /> <br />means, He is not so humble or weak that He needs to have a helper or supporter or adviser, rather He Alone, with no partner or associate, may He be exalted, is the Creator of all things and is the One Who is running and controlling them by His will, with no partner or associate. <br /> <br />Mujahid said&#59; <br /> <br />He does not form an alliance with anyone, nor does He seek the support or help of anyone. <br /> <br />وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And magnify Him with all magnificence. <br /> <br />means, glorify and extol Him far above whatever the transgressors and aggressors say. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Qurazi used to say about this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا <br /> (And say&#59;&#34;All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has not begotten a son...&#34;) that the Jews and Christians said that Allah has taken a son; the Arabs said, &#34;At Your service, You have no partner except the partner You have, and You possess him and whatever he owns;&#34; and the <b>Sabians</b> and <b>Magians</b> said, &#34;If it were not for the supporters of Allah, He would be weak.&#34; Then Allah revealed this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَلَم يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلَّ وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br />And say&#59;&#34;All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has not begotten a son, and Who has no partner in (His) dominion, nor is He low to have a supporter.
