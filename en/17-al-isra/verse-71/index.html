(36&#59;12) <br /> <br />وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ فَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ <br /> <br />And the Book (one's record) will be placed, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is (recorded) therein. (18&#59;49) <br /> <br />وَتَرَى كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً كُلُّ أمَّةٍ تُدْعَى إِلَى كِتَـبِهَا الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br />هَـذَا كِتَـبُنَا يَنطِقُ عَلَيْكُم بِالْحَقِّ إِنَّا كُنَّا نَسْتَنسِخُ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br />And you will see each nation humbled to their knees, each nation will be called to its record (of deeds). This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do. This Our record speaks about you with truth. Verily, We were recording what you used to do. (45&#59;28-29) <br /> <br />This does not contradict the fact that the Prophet will be brought forward when Allah judges between his <b>Ummah</b>, for he will inevitably be a witness against his <b>Ummah</b> over their deeds. But what is meant here by <b>Imam</b> is the Book of deeds. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ فَمَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ يَقْرَوُونَ كِتَابَهُمْ <br /> <br />(And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) <b>Imam</b>. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, <br /> <br />means, because of their happiness and joy at what is recorded therein of good deeds - they will read it and want to read it. <br /> <br />As Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيَقُولُ هَأوُمُ اقْرَوُاْ كِتَـبيَهْ <br /> <br />Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand will say&#59;&#34;Here! read my record!) until His saying, <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ <br /> <br />But as for him who will be given his record in his left hand, (69&#59;19-29) <br /> <br />وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least (<b>Fatilan</b>). <br /> <br />We have already mentioned that the <b>Fatil</b> is the long thread in the groove of a date-pit. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded a <b>Hadith</b> from Abu Hurayrah according to which the Prophet said, concerning the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ <br /></b> (And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) <b>Imam</b>. <br /> <br />يُدْعَى أَحَدُهُمْ فَيُعْطَى كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ وَيُمَدُّ لَهُ فِي جِسْمِهِ وَيَبْيَضُّ وَجْهُهُ وَيُجْعَلُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ تَاجٌ مِنْ لُوْلُوَةٍ يَتَلَْلَاُ فَيَنْطَلِقُ إِلَى أَصْحَابِهِ فَيَرَوْنَهُ مِنْ بَعِيدٍ فَيَقُولُونَ <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ اتِنَا بِهَذَا وَبَارِكْ لَنَا فِي هَذَا <br /> <br />فَيَأْتِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ لَهُمْ أَبْشِرُوا فَإِنَّ لِكُلِّ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ مِثْلَ هَذَا <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا الْكَافِرُ فَيَسْوَدُّ وَجْهُهُ وَيُمَدُّ لَهُ في جِسْمِهِ وَيَرَاهُ أَصْحَابُهُ فَيَقُولُونَ <br /> <br />نَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنْ هَذَا أَوْ مِنْ شَرِّ هَذَا اللَّهُمَّ لَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ <br /> <br />فَيَأْتِيهُمْ فَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُمَّ أَخْزِهِ <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ أَبْعَدَكُمُ اللهُ فَإِنَّ لِكُلِّ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ مِثْلَ هَذَا <br /> <br />One of you will be called and will be given his Book in his right hand. He will be in a good physical state, with a white face, and there will be placed on his head a crown of shining pearls. He will go to his companions and they will see him from afar, and will say, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah, let him come to us and bless us with this.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he will come to them and will say to them, &#34;Rejoice, for every man among you will be like this.&#34; <br /> <br />As for the disbeliever, his face will be black and his body will be enlarged. His companions will see him from afar and will say, <br /> <br />&#34;We seek refuge in Allah from this, or from the evil of this, O Allah, do not let him come to us.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he will come to them and they will say, &#34;O Allah, humiliate him!&#34; <br /> <br />He will say, &#34;May Allah cast you away, every man among you will be like this.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Al-Bazzar said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This was only reported through this chain.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 70" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الإسراء<span class="num-ar">17</span> :<span class="num-ar">71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Isra'<span> 17</span>:<span>71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Bani Isra'eel, Subhan</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 72" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
