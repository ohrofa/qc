And We sent the she-camel to <b>Thamud</b> as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. And We sent not the signs except to make them afraid (of destruction). <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;The idolators said&#59;`O Muhammad, you claim that before you there were Prophets, among whom was one to whom the wind was subjugated, and another who could bring the dead back to life. If you want us to believe in you, ask your Lord to turn As-Safa' into gold for us.' <br /> <br />Allah conveyed to him by inspiration (<b>Wahy</b>)&#59; <br /> <br />`I have heard what they have said. If you wish, I will do what they say, but if they do not believe after that, the punishment will come down upon them, because after the sign has been sent, there is no room for speculation. Or if you wish, I will be patient with your people and give them more time.' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />يَارَبِّ اسْتَأْنِ بِهِم <br /> <br />O Lord, give them more time.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also narrated by Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and others. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The people of Makkah asked the Prophet to turn As-Safa' into gold for them, and to remove the mountains (from around Makkah) so that they could cultivate the land. <br /> <br />It was said to him (by Allah)&#59;`If you wish, I will be patient and give them more time, or if you wish, I will do what they are asking, but if they then disbelieve, they will be destroyed as the nations before them were destroyed.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />لَاا بَلِ اسْتَأْنِ بِهِم <br /> <br />No, be patient and give them more time. <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالايَاتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الَاوَّلُونَ <br /> <br />And nothing stops Us from sending the <b>Ayat</b> but that the people of old denied them. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i also reported this from the <b>Hadith</b> of Jarir. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />The Quraysh said to the Prophet, &#34;Ask your Lord to turn As-Safa' into gold and we will believe in you.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <b> <br />وَتَفْعَلُونَ <br /></b> (Will you really do that)? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />So he asked his Lord, and Jibril came to him and said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Your Lord conveys His Salam to you and says, `If you wish, I will turn As-Safa' into gold for them, then whoever of them disbelieves after that, will be punished with a torment the like of which has never be seen in creation; or if you wish, I will open the gates of repentance and mercy for them.&#34;' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />بَلْ بَابُ التَّوْبَةِ وَالرَّحْمَة <br /> <br />Rather the gates of repentance and mercy. <br /> <br />وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِالايَاتِ إِلاَّ تَخْوِيفًا <br /> <br />And We sent not the signs except to make them afraid (of destruction). <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah makes people afraid with whatever signs He wills, so that they may learn a lesson and remember and return to Him. <br /> <br />We were told that Al-Kufah was shaken at the time of Ibn Mas`ud, who said&#59;`O people, your Lord is rebuking you, so pay heed!&#34;' <br /> <br />Similarly, it was reported that Al-Madinah was struck by several earthquakes at the time of Umar bin Al-Khattab. <br /> <br />Umar said&#59;&#34;You have changed, by Allah, and if such a quake were to strike again, I will subject you to such and such.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, in a <b>Hadith</b> whose authenticity is agreed upon&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ ايَتَانِ مِنْ ايَاتِ اللهِ وَإِنَّهُمَا لَا يَنْكَسِفَانِ لِمَوْتِ أَحَدٍ وَلَا لِحَيَاتِهِ وَلَكِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يُخَوِّفُ بِهِمَا عِبَادَهُ فَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ ذَلِكَ فَافْزَعُوا إِلَى ذِكْرِهِ وَدُعَايِهِ وَاسْتِغْفَارِهِ <br /> <br />ثُمَّ قَالَ يَا أُمَّةَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَاللهِ مَا أَحَدٌ أَغْيَرَ مِنَ اللهِ أَنْ يَزْنِيَ عَبْدُهُ أَوْ تَزْنِيَ أَمَتُهُ <br /> <br />يَا أُمَّةَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَاللهِ لَوْ تَعْلَمُونَ مَا أَعْلَمُ لَضَحِكْتُمْ قَلِيلًا وَلَبَكَيْتُمْ كَثِيرًا <br /> <br />The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah, and they are not eclipsed for the death or life of anyone. Allah uses them to make His servants afraid, so if you see them, hasten to remember Him, call on Him and seek His forgiveness. <br /> <br />Then he said&#59; <br /> <br />O <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad, by Allah, no one has a greater sense of jealousy than Allah if He sees His servant, or female servant, committing <b>Zina</b> (illegal sexual intercourse). <br /> <br />O <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 58" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الإسراء<span class="num-ar">17</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Isra'<span> 17</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Bani Isra'eel, Subhan</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 60" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
