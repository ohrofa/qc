He is able to create you anew, no matter what you have become. <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him. (30&#59;27) <br /> <br />فَسَيُنْغِضُونَ إِلَيْكَ رُوُوسَهُمْ <br /> <br />Then, they will shake their heads at you, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;They will move their heads in a gesture of mockery.&#34; <br /> <br />This view expressed by Ibn Abbas and Qatadah is; <br /> <br />what the Arabs understand from the language, because the word used <b>Fasayunghidun</b> indicates an up-and-down movement <b>Nughad</b>. A word derived from the same root, <b>Naghd</b>, is used to refer to the young of the ostrich, because when it walks, it walks quickly and moves its head. The same word is used to describe a tooth when it becomes loose and is detached from its place. <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هُوَ <br /> <br />and say&#59;&#34;When will that be!&#34; <br /> <br />This shows that they thought it very unlikely that it would happen, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;When will this promise (i.e. Resurrection) be fulfilled, if you are truthful!&#34; (36&#59;48) <br /> <br />يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ بِهَا <br /> <br />Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it (the Hour). (42&#59;18) <br /> <br />قُلْ عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيبًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Perhaps it is near!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, beware of it, for it is at hand and will no doubt come to you, and what will be will be</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 50" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الإسراء<span class="num-ar">17</span> :<span class="num-ar">51</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Isra'<span> 17</span>:<span>51</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Bani Isra'eel, Subhan</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 52" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
