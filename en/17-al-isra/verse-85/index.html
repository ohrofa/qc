Some of them said to the others, `Ask him about the <b>Ruh</b>.' <br /> <br />Some of them said, `What urges you to ask him about that?' <br /> <br />Others said, `Do not ask him, lest he gives you a reply which you do not like.' <br /> <br />But they said, `Ask him.' So they asked him about the <b>Ruh</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet kept quiet and did not give them an answer, and I knew that he was receiving revelation, so I stayed where I was. When the revelation was complete, the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي <br /> <br />And they ask you concerning the <b>Ruh</b> (the spirit). <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;The <b>Ruh</b> (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord...&#34; <br /> <br />This context would seem to imply that this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed in Al-Madinah, and that it was revealed when the Jews asked him this question in Al-Madinah, although the entire <b>Surah</b> was revealed in Makkah. <br /> <br />This may be answered with the suggestion that this <b>Ayah</b> may have been revealed to him in Al-Madinah a second time, after having previously been revealed in Makkah, or that he was divinely inspired to respond to their question with a previously-revealed <b>Ayah</b>, namely the <b>Ayah</b> in question. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The People of the Book asked the Messenger of Allah about the <b>Ruh</b>, and Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ <br /> <br />And they ask you concerning the Ruh... <br /> <br />They said, `You claim that we have only a little knowledge, but we have been given the <b>Tawrah</b>, which is the <b>Hikmah</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُوْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِىَ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا <br /> <br />and he, to whom <b>Hikmah</b> is granted, is indeed granted abundant good.' (2&#59;269) <br /> <br />Then the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَمٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ <br /> <br />And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea (were ink wherewith to write), with seven seas behind it to add to its (supply), (31&#59;27) was revealed. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Whatever knowledge you have been given, if Allah saves you from the Fire thereby, then it is great and good, but in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, it is very little.&#34; <br /> <br />وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ <br /> <br />And they ask you concerning the <b>Ruh</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This was when the Jews said to the Prophet, `Tell us about the <b>Ruh</b> and how the <b>Ruh</b> will be punished that is in the body - for the <b>Ruh</b> is something about which only Allah knows, and there was no revelation concerning it.' <br /> <br />He did not answer them at all, then Jibril came to him and said&#59; <br /> <br />قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّن الْعِلْمِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;The <b>Ruh</b> (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.&#34; <br /> <br />So the Prophet told them about that, and they said, `Who told you this' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />جَاءَنِي بِهِ جِبْرِيلُ مِنْ عِنْدِ الله <br /> <br />Jibril brought it to me from Allah. <br /> <br />They said, `By Allah, no one has told you that except our enemy (i.e., Jibril).' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it.&#34; (2&#59;97) <br /><b>The Ruh and the Nafs</b> <br /> <br />As-Suhayili mentioned the dispute among the scholars over whether the <b>Ruh</b> is the same as the <b>Nafs</b>, or something different. He stated that; <br /> <br />it is light and soft, like air, flowing through the body like water through the veins of a tree. <br /> <br />He states that the <b>Ruh</b> which the angel breathes into the fetus is the <b>Nafs</b>, provided that it joins the body and acquires certain qualities because of it, whether good or bad. <br /> <br />So then it is either a soul in (complete) rest and satisfaction (89&#59;27) or inclined to evil (12&#59;53), just as water is the life of the tree, then by mixing with it, it produces something else, so that if it mixes with grapes and the grapes are then squeezed, it becomes juice or wine. Then it is no longer called water, except in a metaphorical sense. <br /> <br />Thus we should understand the connection between <b>Nafs</b> and <b>Ruh</b>; <br /> <br />the <b>Ruh</b> is not called <b>Nafs</b> except when it joins the body and is affected by it. <br /> <br />So in conclusion we may say&#59;the <b>Ruh</b> is the origin and essence, and the <b>Nafs</b> consists of the <b>Ruh</b> and its connection to the body. So they are the same in one sense but not in another. <br /> <br />This is a good explanation, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />I say&#59;people speak about the essence of the <b>Ruh</b> and its rulings, and many books have been written on this topic. One of the best of those who spoke of this was Al-Hafiz Ibn Mandah in a book which we have heard about the <b>Ruh</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 84" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الإسراء<span class="num-ar">17</span> :<span class="num-ar">85</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Isra'<span> 17</span>:<span>85</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Bani Isra'eel, Subhan</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Isra&#39; Verse 86" href="/en/17-al-isra/verse-86/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
