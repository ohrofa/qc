Sometimes He casts something into the heart of the Prophet, and he has no doubt that it is from Allah, as it was reported in <b>Sahih</b> Ibn Hibban that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ رُوْحَ الْقُدُسِ نَفَثَ فِي رُوعِي أَنَّ نَفْسًا لَنْ تَمُوتَ حَتْى تَسْتَكْمِلَ رِزْقَهَا وَأَجَلَهَا فَاتَّقُوا اللهَ وَأَجْمِلُوا فِي الطَّلَب <br /><b>Ar-Ruh Al-Qudus</b> (i.e., Jibril) breathed into my heart that no soul will die until its allotted provision and time have expired, so have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah and keep seeking in a good (and lawful) way. <br /> <br />أَوْ مِن وَرَاء حِجَابٍ <br /> <br />or from behind a veil -- <br /> <br />as He spoke to Musa, peace be upon him. He asked to see Him after He had spoken to him, but this was not granted to him. <br /> <br />In the Sahih, it recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Jabir bin Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him&#59; <br /> <br />مَا كَلَّمَ اللهُ أَحَدًا إِلاَّ مِنْ وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ وَإِنَّهُ كَلَّمَ أَبَاكَ كِفَاحًا <br /> <br />Allah never speaks to anyone except from behind a veil, but He spoke to your father directly. <br /> <br />This is how it was stated in the Hadith. <br /> <br />He (Jabir's father) was killed on the day of <b>Uhud</b>, but this refers to the realm of <b>Al-Barzakh</b>, whereas the Ayah speaks of this earthly realm. <br /> <br />أَوْ يُرْسِلَ رَسُولاً فَيُوحِيَ بِإِذْنِهِ مَا يَشَاء <br /> <br />or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave. <br /> <br />as Jibril, peace be upon him, and other angels came down to the Prophets, peace be upon them. <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ عَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise. <br /> <br />He is Most High, All-Knowing, Most Wise</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 50" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الشورى<span class="num-ar">42</span> :<span class="num-ar">51</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Asy-Syura<span> 42</span>:<span>51</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem 'Ain Seen Coff</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 52" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=42,sura_dir="ash-shura",count_ayat=53,number_aya=51;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
