They instituted taboos, such as the <b>Bahirah</b>, <b>Sa'ibah</b>, <b>Wasilah</b> or <b>Ham</b>. They also permitted eating flesh and blood of animals not slaughtered for consumption, gambling and other kinds of misguidance, ignorance and falsehood. These are things that they invented during <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, when they came up with all kinds of false rulings on what was permitted and what was forbidden, and false rites of worship and other corrupt ideas. <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />رَأَيْتُ عَمْرَو بْنَ لُحَيِّ بْنِ قَمَعَةَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِي النَّار <br /> <br />I saw `Amr bin Luhayy bin Qama`ah dragging his intestines in Hell -- (because he had been the first one to introduce the idea of the <b>Sa'ibah</b>). <br /> <br />This man was one of the kings of the Khuza`ah tribe, and he was the first one to do these things. He was the one who had made the Quraysh worship idols, may the curse of Allah be upon him. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةُ الْفَصْلِ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />And had it not been for a decisive Word, the matter would have been judged between them. <br /> <br />means, the punishment would have been hastened for them, were it not for the fact that it had already been decreed that it would be delayed until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And verily, for the wrongdoers there is a painful torment. <br /> <br />i.e., an agonizing torment in Hell, what a terrible destination. <br /><b>The Terror of the Idolators in the Place of Gathering</b> <br /> <br />Allah says;</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 20" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الشورى<span class="num-ar">42</span> :<span class="num-ar">21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Asy-Syura<span> 42</span>:<span>21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem 'Ain Seen Coff</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 22" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=42,sura_dir="ash-shura",count_ayat=53,number_aya=21;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
