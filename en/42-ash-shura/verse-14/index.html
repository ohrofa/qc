But those to whom the Book has been given as an inheritance after them, behold, they are in doubt of it disquieting.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>They divided, out of rivalry, only after knowledge had come to them, and, if it had not been for a decree already passed by your Lord to reprieve them until an appointed time, they would already have been judged. Those after them, who inherited the Scripture, are in disquieting doubt about it.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And they divided not until after knowledge had come to them, through spite between themselves; And had not a word gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, the affair would surely have been judged between them. And verily those who have been made inheritors of the Book after them are in doubt thereof dubitating.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them&#59; But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>They did not split up except after knowledge had come to them, and then only because they wished to commit excesses against each other. Had your Lord not already decreed that judgement would be made later at an appointed time, the matter between them would surely have been decided once and for all. Indeed those who were later made the heirs of the Book are in disquieting doubt about it.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Yet they did not differ about it until knowledge came to them, through rivalries among themselves. If the Word of your Lord, (staying) it for a time ordained, had not preceded it, the matter would have been settled among them. But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And they did not cause divisions except after the knowledge had come to them, because of jealousy among themselves; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been passed upon them long ago; and indeed those who inherited the Book after them are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>They did not divide [into sects] except after the knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and were it not for a prior decree of your Lord [granting them reprieve] until a specified time, decision would have been made between them. Indeed those who were made heirs to the Book after them are in grave doubt concerning it.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>And they (who follow the previous Ways) were not divided (into opposing groups) until after the knowledge came to them (of the way they must follow and what that entailed, and only) because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. Had it not been for a decree already issued by your Lord, (granting people respite and postponing the final, decisive judgment) until an appointed term, it would indeed have been judged between them. Surely those who (succeeded those opposing groups and) inherited the Book, are in doubting uncertainty about it.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>And these (rejecters of the faith) split themselves into factions only after (true) knowledge (of the fundamental principles of faith) had come to them (and that too) out of jealousy among themselves and to spite one another. But for the word (of promise) already gone forth from your Lord, (that they would be given respite) for a fixed term, the judgment upon these (disbelievers) would surely have long been passed (by their complete annihilation). As for those who have been made to inherit the Scripture after these (Prophets) they are in a disquieting and grave doubt about this (Qur´ân).</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>And they did not separate except from after the knowledge came to them, oppression/transgression between them, and where it not (for) a word/expression preceded from your Lord to a named/identified (specified) term/time, (it) would have been executed/ended (E) between them, and that truly those who were made to inherit The Book from after them (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it.</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>And they did not cause divisions except after the knowledge had come to them, because of jealousy among themselves; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been passed upon them long ago; and indeed those who inherited the Book after them are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.</p></div><div id="hamid-s-aziz"><h3><span>13</span> Hamid S.

And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have been settled between them. And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture [i.e. the Taurah (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] after them (i.e. Jews and Christians) are in grave doubt concerning it (i.e. Allah's true religion Islam or the Quran).</p></div><div id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><h3><span>15</span> Maulana Mohammad Ali</h3><p>He has made plain to you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and We have revealed to thee, and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus -- to establish religion and not to be divided therein.

And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it.</p></div><div id="sarwar"><h3><span>18</span> Muhammad Sarwar</h3><p>Only after receiving the knowledge did people divide themselves into different groups because of rebellion among themselves. Had it not been for your Lord's giving them respite for an appointed time, He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all. Those who inherited the Book, from their quarrelsome predecessors, also have doubts and suspicions about it.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>Yet they became divided only after knowledge had reached them from their own insolence. And had it not been for a Word that had preceded from yourLord, till an appointed term, it would have been determined between them. But those who inherited the Book after them are in disquieting doubt about it,</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, through transgression between themselves.

Those who inherited the Book after them are indeed in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion about it.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>They became divided only after knowledge came to them, out of resentment among themselves.

And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord, to defer requital [of them], until an appointed term, [until] the Day of Resurrection, it would have [already] been judged between them, to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them, namely, the Jews and the Christians, are truly in grave doubt concerning him, Muhammad (s).</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَمَا تَفَرَّقُوا إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءهُمُ الْعِلْمُ <br /> <br />And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, <br /> <br />means, their opposition to the truth arose after it had come to them and proof had been established against them.
