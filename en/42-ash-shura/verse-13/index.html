This Ayah mentions all five, just as they are also mentioned in the Ayah in Surah <b>Al-Ahzab</b>, where Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنْكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ <br /> <br />And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from <b>Nuh</b>, Ibrahim, Musa, and Isa son of Maryam. (33&#59;7) <br /> <br />The Message which all the Messengers brought was to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ <br /> <br />And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying)&#59;None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me. (21&#59;25). <br /> <br />And according to a Hadith (the Prophet said)&#59; <br /> <br />نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّتٍ دِينُنَا وَاحِد <br /> <br />We Prophets are brothers and our religion is one. <br /> <br />In other words, the common bond between them is that Allah Alone is to be worshipped, with no partner or associate, even though their laws and ways may differ, as Allah says. <br /> <br />لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَـجاً <br /> <br />To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. (5&#59;48) <br /> <br />Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />أَنْ أَقِيمُوا الدِّينَ وَلَا تَتَفَرَّقُوا فِيهِ <br /> <br />saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah enjoined all the Prophets (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all) to be as one and He forbade them to differ and be divided. <br /> <br />كَبُرَ عَلَى الْمُشْرِكِينَ مَا تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />Intolerable for the idolators is that to which you call them. <br /> <br />means, `it is too much for them to bear, and they hate that to which you call them, O Muhammad, i.e., <b>Tawhid</b>.' <br /> <br />اللَّهُ يَجْتَبِي إِلَيْهِ مَن يَشَاء وَيَهْدِي إِلَيْهِ مَن يُنِيبُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself who turns to Him in repentance. <br /> <br />means, He is the One Who decrees guidance for those who deserve it, and decrees misguidance for those who prefer it to the right path. <br /> <br />Allah says here</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 12" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الشورى<span class="num-ar">42</span> :<span class="num-ar">13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Asy-Syura<span> 42</span>:<span>13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem 'Ain Seen Coff</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 14" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=42,sura_dir="ash-shura",count_ayat=53,number_aya=13;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
