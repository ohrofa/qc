All I ask of you is that you withhold your evil from me and let me convey the Messages of my Lord. If you will not help me, then do not disturb me, for the sake of the ties of kinship that exist between you and I.' <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about the Ayah&#59; <br />إِلاَّ الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَى <br /> (except to be kind to me for my kinship with you). <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said, &#34;To be kind to the family of Muhammad.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, &#34;No, you have jumped to a hasty conclusion. There was no clan among Quraysh to whom the Prophet did not have some ties of kinship.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, &#34;Except that you uphold the ties of kinship that exist between me and you.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad with a different chain of narration. <br /> <br />وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَّزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْنًا <br /> <br />And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof, <br /> <br />means, `whoever does a good deed, We will increase him in good for it, i.e., in reward.' <br /> <br />This is like the Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُوْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً <br /> <br />Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward. (4&#59;40) <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate. <br /> <br />means, He forgives many bad deeds and increases a small amount of good deeds; <br /> <br />He conceals and forgives sins and He multiplies and increases the reward of good deeds. <br /><b>The Accusation that the Prophet fabricated the Qur'an -- and the Response to that</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 22" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الشورى<span class="num-ar">42</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Asy-Syura<span> 42</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem 'Ain Seen Coff</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ash-Shura Verse 24" href="/en/42-ash-shura/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
