For God is the Independent One, [without need] of your expending; while you are the needy, of Him. And if you turn away, from obedience to Him, He will replace you with another people, that is to say, He will bring them in your place, and they will not be the likes of you, in turning away from obedience to Him, but [they will be] obedient to Him, Mighty and Majestic [is He]. Medinese&#59; it was revealed on the return from al-Hudaybiyya; it consists of 29 verses.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>هَاأَنتُمْ هَوُلَااء تُدْعَوْنَ لِتُنفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />فَمِنكُم مَّن <br /> <br />Here you are now invited to spend in Allah's cause; but among you are those who withhold (stingily). <br /> <br />meaning, they refuse to spend. <br /> <br />Allah continues, <br /> <br />يَبْخَلُ وَمَن يَبْخَلْ فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ <br /> <br />And whoever acts stingily is but stingy toward himself. <br /> <br />meaning, he only reduces his own rewards, and the bad outcome of that will come back to him. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ الْغَنِيُّ <br /> <br />For Allah is indeed <b>Al-Ghani</b>, <br /> <br />Allah is in need of nothing else, whereas everything is ever in need of Him. <br /> <br />Thus, Allah says, <br /> <br />وَأَنتُمُ الْفُقَرَاء <br /> <br />while you are the needy. <br /> <br />meaning, specifically of Him. <br /> <br />The description of Allah as <b>Al-Ghani</b> (in no need) is a necessary description of Allah; on the other hand, the description of the creation as <b>Faqr</b> (needy) is a necessary description for them that they cannot avoid. <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْا <br /> <br />And if you turn away, <br /> <br />which means, if you turn away from obeying Him and adhering to His Laws. <br /> <br />يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُونُوا أَمْثَالَكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He will replace you with other people; then they will not be like you. <br /> <br />meaning, rather, they will be people who will listen to Him and obey His commands. <br /> <br />This concludes the Tafsir of Surah <b>Muhammad</b>. And Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Muhammad Verse 37" href="/en/47-muhammad/verse-37/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> محمد<span class="num-ar">47</span> :<span class="num-ar">38</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Muhammad<span> 47</span>:<span>38</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Qital</span></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
