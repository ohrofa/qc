Rather, it is good in its appearance, taste, smell, and effect, as Allah says, <br /> <br />لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلَا هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ <br /> <br />it (the wine) has no bad effects, nor does it cause intoxication.

The rivers then gush out of them. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi reported this narration in his section of the Description of Paradise, and he said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />In the Sahih, it is recorded that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ تَعَالى فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ فَإِنَّهُ أَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ وَأَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَمِنْهُ تُفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمن <br /> <br />When you ask Allah, ask Him for <b>Al-Firdaws</b>, because it is the central and highest part of the Paradise, and from it gush the rivers of the Paradise and above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ <br />and therein for them are all kinds of fruits, <br /> <br />This similar to His saying, <br /> <br />يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِكلِّ فَـكِهَةٍ ءَامِنِينَ <br /> <br />They will call in it for every kind of fruit in peace and security.

(55&#59;52) <br /> <br />Allah says <br /> <br />وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ <br />and forgiveness from their Lord. <br /> <br />meaning, in addition to all of the above. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />كَمَنْ هُوَ خَالِدٌ فِي النَّارِ <br /> <br />Can this be likened to those who abide eternally in the Fire? <br /> <br />meaning, `can those that We have described their position in the Paradise be like those who will abide eternally in the Fire?' <br /> <br />They are not equal, and nor are those who will be in the high ranks (in the Paradise) and those who will be in the lowest depths (Hell). <br /> <br />وَسُقُوا مَاء حَمِيمًا <br /> <br />and are given to drink boiling water, <br /> <br />meaning, extremely hot; so hot that it is unbearable. <br /> <br />فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَاءهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that severs their intestines, <br /> <br />meaning, that will cut their insides -- both bowels and intestines. <br /> <br />We seek refuge in Allah from that</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Muhammad Verse 14" href="/en/47-muhammad/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> محمد<span class="num-ar">47</span> :<span class="num-ar">15</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Muhammad<span> 47</span>:<span>15</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Qital</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Muhammad Verse 16" href="/en/47-muhammad/verse-16/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=47,sura_dir="muhammad",count_ayat=38,number_aya=15;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
