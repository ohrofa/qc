Therefore, it was for the Messenger of Allah, and he used it for the needs of his family for a year at a time, and the rest was used to buy armors and weapons used in the cause of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad collected the short form of this story. <br /> <br />The Group, with the exception of Ibn Majah, collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Malik bin `Aws said, <br /> <br />&#34;While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and I went along with him and entered the place where Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and without a mattress. He said when I went in, <br /> <br />`O Malik! Some of your people's families came to me due to their famine, and I have ordered that relief aid should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.' <br /> <br />I said, `I wish that you ordered someone else to do it.' <br /> <br />He said, `Take it.' <br /> <br />Then Yarfa (the servant of Umar) came saying, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit `Uthman bin `Affan, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas?' <br /> <br />Umar said, `Yes,' and they came in. <br /> <br />After a while Yarfa came again and said, `O Commander of the faithful! May I admit Al-Abbas and Ali'? <br /> <br />Umar said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />So, they were admitted and Al-Abbas said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and this one (i.e., Ali).' <br /> <br />The group (being `Uthman and his companions) said, `O Chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them from each other.' <br /> <br />I (Malik bin Aws) thought that they asked the four men to come in before them for this purpose. <br /> <br />Umar said, `Be patient!' <br /> <br />He then asked the group (Uthman and his companions), `I ask you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />لَاا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة <br /> <br />Our (the Prophet's) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity. <br /> <br />The group said, `He said so.' <br /> <br />Umar then turned to Ali and Al-Abbas and said, <br /> <br />`I beseech you by Allah by Whose permission the heaven and the earth exist, do you know both that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />لَاا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة <br /> <br />Our (the Prophets) property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity. <br /> <br />They replied, `He said so.' <br /> <br />Umar then said, <br /> <br />`Allah bestowed on His Messenger a special favor unlike what he gave all other people. Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />وَمَا أَفَاء اللَّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَا أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلَا رِكَابٍ <br /> <br />وَلَكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br />(And what Allah gave as booty (<b>Fai'</b>) to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things. <br /> <br />Therefore, this property, the booty collected from Bani An-Nadir, was especially given to Allah's Messenger. However, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave you, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion. Allah's Messenger took the yearly expenses from it for himself and his family and left the rest in the Muslim Treasury.' <br /> <br />He then asked the group, `I ask you by Allah with Whose permission the heavens and earth exist, do you know this' <br /> <br />They replied, `Yes.' <br /> <br />Umar then said to Ali and Al-Abbas, `I ask you by Allah, with Whose permission that heavens and earth exist, do you know this' <br /> <br />They said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />Umar added, <br /> <br />`When Allah took His Prophet unto Him, Abu Bakr said&#59;I am the successor of Allah's Messenger! Then you both came to Abu Bakr asking for your (Al-Abbas') share of inheritance from your nephew, and he (Ali) asked for his wife's share from her father's inheritance. Abu Bakr said&#59;Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />لَاا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَا صَدَقَة <br /> <br />Our (the Prophets') property will not be inherited. Whatever we leave, is charity.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah knows that Abu Bakr was true, pious, rightly guided and a follower of what was right. So, Abu Bakr assumed the responsibility of that property. When Abu Bakr died, I said&#59;I am the successor of Allah's Messenger and the successor of Abu Bakr. So I managed it as long as Allah allowed me to manage it. Then you both (`Ali and Al-`Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case, asking for that property. I said to you&#59;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish. I will do so on the condition that you will take a pledge before Allah's that you will manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger used to. So, both of you agreed and on that condition I handed it over to you. Now you come to me to render a different judgement over the property than the one I made before. By Allah, I will never give any decision other than what I have already given, until the Last Hour begins. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf,&#34; <br /> <br />They recorded this from the Hadith of Az-Zuhri. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />كَيْ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ الاَْغْنِيَاء مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />in order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you. <br /> <br />means, `We made the expenditures for the <b>Fai'</b> like this, so that the wealth does not remain among the wealthy, who would spend it as they wish and desire and give none of it to the poor.' <br /><b>Ordering Obedience of the Messenger in All Commands and Prohibitions</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />وَمَا اتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا <br /> <br />And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). <br /> <br />meaning, `whatever the Messenger commands you, then do it and whatever he forbids you, then avoid it. Surely, He only commands righteousness and forbids evil.' <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah curses women who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and the women who remove the hair from their eyebrows and faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful, whereby changing Allah's creation.&#34; <br /> <br />His statement reached a woman from Bani Asad called, Umm Ya`qub, who came to Abdullah and said, &#34;I have come to know that you have cursed such and such&#34; <br /> <br />He replied, &#34;Why should I not curse those whom Allah's Messenger has cursed and who are cursed in Allah's Book!&#34; <br /> <br />Umm Ya`qub said, &#34;I have read the whole Qur'an, but did not find in it what you say.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Verily, if you have read the Qur'an, you have found it. Didn't you read, <br />وَمَا اتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا <br /> (And whatsoever the Messenger gives you take it and whatsoever he forbids you, you abstain (from it)).&#34; <br /> <br />She replied, &#34;Yes, I did.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Verily, Allah's Messenger forbade such things.&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;But I think that your wife does these things&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Go and look at her.&#34; <br /> <br />She went and watched her, but could not see anything in support of her claim. She went back to Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said that she did not notice anything on his wife. On that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her with me.&#34; <br /> <br />The Two Sahihs recorded this from the Hadith of Sufyan Ath-Thawri. As well as a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِأَمْرٍ فَايْتُوا مِنْهُ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ وَمَا نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْهُ فَاجْتَنِبُوه <br /> <br />When I order you to do something, then do as much as you can of it. If I forbid something for you, then shun it. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment. <br /> <br />means, fear Allah by obeying His orders and refraining from His prohibitions. Surely, Allah is severe in punishment for those who defy Him and reject and disobey His commands as well as, those who commit what He forbids and prohibits</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Hashr Verse 6" href="/en/59-al-hashr/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحشر<span class="num-ar">59</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hasyr<span> 59</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Banu Nadeer</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Hashr Verse 8" href="/en/59-al-hashr/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=59,sura_dir="al-hashr",count_ayat=24,number_aya=7;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
