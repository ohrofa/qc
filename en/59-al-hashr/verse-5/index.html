Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever <b>Linah</b> was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur'an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah's leave.&#34; <br /> <br />There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مَا قَطَعْتُم مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَايِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />وَلِيُخْزِيَ الْفَاسِقِينَ <br /> <br />What you cut down of the <b>Linah</b>, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious. <br /> <br />&#34;They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah's Messenger if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.' Allah sent down this Ayah, <br /> <br />مَا قَطَعْتُم مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَايِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />What you cut down of the <b>Linah</b>, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Umar said; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. <br /> <br />The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet's side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled.&#34; <br /> <br />The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn Umar; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah, <br /> <br />مَا قَطَعْتُم مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَايِمَةً عَلَى أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />وَلِيُخْزِيَ الْفَاسِقِينَ <br /> <br />What you cut down of the <b>Linah</b>, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of <b>Uhud</b> and <b>Bi'r Ma`unah</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hashr Verse 4" href="/en/59-al-hashr/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحشر<span class="num-ar">59</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hasyr<span> 59</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Banu Nadeer</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hashr Verse 6" href="/en/59-al-hashr/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
