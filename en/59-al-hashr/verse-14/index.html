They only fight when they have to defend themselves (even though they threaten Muslims of reprisals. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />بَأْسُهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ <br /> <br /> <br />Their enmity among themselves is very great. <br /> <br />meaning, the enmity they feel against each other is intense, <br /> <br />It is as said, <br /> <br />وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />And make you to taste the violence of one another.
