They also forbid what Allah forbade for them, by the words of His honorable Messengers. The Messengers, may Allah's peace and blessings be on all of them, are the emissaries between Allah and His creation, conveying Allah's Message and Trust. The messengers indeed fulfilled their mission, gave sincere advice to creation and conveyed the truth to them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن كُونُواْ رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />On the contrary (he would say), &#34;Be you <b>Rabbaniyyun</b>, because you are teaching the Book, and you are studying it.&#34; <br /> <br />means, the Messenger recommends the people to be <b>Rabbaniyyun</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Abu Razin and several others said that; <br /><b>Rabbaniyyun</b> means, &#34;Wise, learned, and forbearing.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak commented concerning Allah's statement, <br />بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ <br /> (because you are teaching the Book, and you are studying it). <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever learns the Qur'an deserves to become a <b>Faqih</b> (learned).&#34; <br /> <br /> وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ <br /> (and you are studying it), <br /> <br />preserving its words. <br /> <br />Allah then said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 78" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-78/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">79</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>79</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 80" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-80/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
