God is Seeing of what you do.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>O you who believe, be not as the disbelievers, that is, [as] the hypocrites, who say of their brothers, that is, regarding their affair, when they travel in the land, and then die, or are on raiding campaigns (ghuzzan, `a raiding party', is the plural of ghzin), and are then slain, `Had they been with us, they would not have died and would not have been slain', in other words, do not say as they say -- so that God may make that, saying [of theirs], as a conclusion of their affair, anguish in their hearts. For God gives life, and He gives death, and so no staying put can prevent death, and God sees what you do (ta`malna, or ya`malna, `they do'), and He will requite you for it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Prohibiting the Ideas of the Disbeleivers about Death and Predestination</b> <br /> <br />Allah forbids His believing servants from the disbelievers' false creed, seen in their statement about those who died in battle and during travel; &#34;Had they abandoned these trips, they would not have met their demise.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقَالُواْ لاِخْوَانِهِمْ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren, <br /> <br />about their dead brethren, <br /> <br />إِذَا ضَرَبُواْ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />when they travel through the earth, <br /> <br />for the purpose of trading and otherwise, <br /> <br />أَوْ كَانُواْ غُزًّى <br /> <br />or go out to fight, <br /> <br />participating in battles, <br /> <br />لَّوْ كَانُواْ عِندَنَا <br /> <br />&#34;If they had stayed with us,&#34; <br /> <br />in our area, <br /> <br />مَا مَاتُواْ وَمَا قُتِلُواْ <br /> <br />&#34;they would not have died or been killed,&#34; <br /> <br />they would not have died while traveling or been killed in battle. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِيَجْعَلَ اللّهُ ذَلِكَ حَسْرَةً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ <br /> <br />so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. <br /> <br />means, Allah creates this evil thought in their hearts so that their sadness and the grief they feel for their loss would increase. <br /> <br />Allah refuted them by saying, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ <br /> <br />It is Allah that gives life and causes death. <br /> <br />for the creation is under Allah's power, and the decision is His Alone. No one lives or dies except by Allah's leave, and no one's life is increased or decreased except by His decree. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Seer of what you do. <br /> <br />for His knowledge and vision encompasses all His creation and none of their affairs ever escapes Him. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَيِن قُتِلْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 155" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-155/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">156</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>156</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 157" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-157/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
