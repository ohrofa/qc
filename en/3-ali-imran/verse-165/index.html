Thus, they suffered the loss of seventy fatalities and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah gave flight and abandoned him. The Messenger suffered a broken tooth, the helmet was smashed on his head and blood flowed onto his face. Allah then revealed, <br /> <br />أَوَلَمَّا أَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّى هَـذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ <br /> <br />When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say&#59;&#34;From where does this come to us!&#34; Say, &#34;It is from yourselves&#34;, <br /> <br />because you took the ransom.&#34; <br /> <br />Furthermore, Muhammad bin Ishaq, Ibn Jurayj, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ <br /></b> (Say, &#34;It is from yourselves.&#34;) means, because you, the archers, disobeyed the Messenger's command to not abandon your positions. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah has power over all things. <br /> <br />and He does what He wills and decides what He wills, and there is none who can resist His decision. <br /> <br />Allah then said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 164" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-164/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">165</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>165</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 166" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-166/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
