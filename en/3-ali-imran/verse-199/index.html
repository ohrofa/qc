Indeed, these are the best people among the People of the Book, whether they were Jews or Christians. <br /> <br />Allah said in Surah <b>Al-Qasas</b>, <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِهِ هُم بِهِ يُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br />وَإِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَأ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ يُوْتُونَ أَجْرَهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ <br /> <br />Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it (the Qur'an). And when it is recited to them, they say&#59;&#34;We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed even before it we were Muslims. These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient. (28&#59;52-54) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ اتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلَوَتِهِ أُوْلَـيِكَ يُوْمِنُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br />Those to whom We gave the Book, recite it (follow it) as it should be recited (i.e. followed), they are the ones who believe therein. (2&#59;121) <br /> <br />وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ <br /> <br />And of the people of Musa there is a community who lead with truth and establish justice therewith. (7&#59;159) <br /> <br />لَيْسُواْ سَوَاءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَأيِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ ءَانَأءَ الَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ <br /> <br />Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. (3&#59;113) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />قُلْ ءَامِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُوْمِنُواْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلٌّذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَأ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلٌّذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Believe in it (the Qur'an) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration.&#34; And they say&#59;&#34;Glory be to our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.&#34; And they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases their humility. (17&#59;107-109) <br /> <br />These qualities exist in some of the Jews, but only a few of them. For instance, less than ten Jewish rabbis embraced the Islamic faith, such as Abdullah bin Salam. Many among the Christians, on the other hand, embraced the Islamic faith. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ النَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ الْيَهُودَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّا نَصَارَى <br /> <br />Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers the Jews and those who commit <b>Shirk</b>, and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say&#59;&#34;We are Christians.&#34; (5&#59;82) until, <br /> <br />فَأَثَابَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِمَا قَالُواْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />So because of what they said, Allah rewarded them Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), they will abide therein forever. (5&#59;85) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ <br /> <br />for them is a reward with their Lord. <br /> <br />When Jafar bin Abi Talib recited Surah <b>Maryam</b> to An-Najashi, King of Ethiopia, in the presence of Christian priests and patriarchs, he and they cried until their beards became wet from crying. <br /> <br />The Two Sahihs record that; <br /> <br />when An-Najashi died, the Prophet conveyed the news to his Companions and said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ أَخًا لَكُمْ بِالْحَبَشَةِ قَدْ مَاتَ فَصَلُّوا عَلَيْه <br /> <br />A brother of yours from Ethiopia has passed, come to offer the funeral prayer. <br /> <br />He went out with the Companions to the <b>Musalla</b> lined them up in rows, and after that led the prayer. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Najih narrated that Mujahid said that, <br />إِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ <br /> (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture), <br /> <br />refers to those among them who embraced Islam. <br /> <br />Abbad bin Mansur said that; <br /> <br />he asked Al-Hasan Al-Basri about Allah's statement, <br />وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَمَن يُوْمِنُ بِاللّهِ <br /> (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah). <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said, <br /> <br />&#34;They are the People of the Book, before Muhammad was sent, who believed in Muhammad and recognized Islam. Allah gave them a double reward, for the faith that they had before Muhammad, and for believing in Muhammad (after he was sent as Prophet).&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded both of these statements. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> record that Abu Musa said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />ثَلَثَةٌ يُوْتَوْنَ أَجْرَهُمْ مَرَّتَيْن <br /> <br />Three persons will acquire a double reward. <br /> <br />He mentioned among them, <br /> <br />وَرَجُلٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ امَنَ بِنَبِيِّهِ وَامَنَ بِي <br /> <br />A person from among the People of the Book who believed in his Prophet and in me. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />لَا يَشْتَرُونَ بِأيَاتِ اللّهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلاً <br /></b> (They do not sell the verses of Allah for a small price), <br /> <br />means, they do not hide the knowledge that they have, as the cursed ones among them have done. Rather, they share the knowledge without a price, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for them is a reward with their Lord. surely, Allah is Swift in account. <br /> <br />Mujahid commented on the verse, <b> <br />سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ <br /></b> ((Surely, Allah is) swift in account), <br /> <br />&#34;He is swift in reckoning,&#34; <br /> <br />as Ibn Abi Hatim and others have recorded from him. <br /><b>The Command for Patience and Ribat</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 198" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-198/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">199</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>199</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 200" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-200/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
