Why, if he should die or is slain, like others, will you turn back on your heels, will you return to unbelief (the last statement is the locus of the interrogative of denial, in other words, `he was not a worshipped being, so that [if he were to die] you should turn back [to your previous religion]'). If any man should turn back on his heels, he will not harm God in any way, but will be harming himself, and God will requite those that are thankful, for His graces by staying firm.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Rumor that the Prophet was Killed at Uhud</b> <br /> <br />When Muslims suffered defeat in battle at <b>Uhud</b> and some of them were killed, <b>Shaytan</b> shouted, &#34;Muhammad has been killed.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Qami'ah went back to the idolators and claimed, &#34;I have killed Muhammad.&#34; <br /> <br />Some Muslims believed this rumor and thought that the Messenger of Allah had been killed, claiming that this could happen, for Allah narrated that this occurred to many Prophets before. Therefore, the Muslims' resolve was weakened and they did not actively participate in battle. <br /> <br />This is why Allah sent down to His Messenger His statement, <br /> <br />وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ <br /> <br />Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed Messengers have passed away before him. <br /> <br />he is to deliver Allah's Message and may be killed in the process, just as what happened to many Prophets before. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Najih said that his father said that; <br /> <br />a man from the <b>Muhajirin</b> passed by an <b>Ansari</b> man who was bleeding (during <b>Uhud</b>) and said to him, &#34;O fellow! Did you know that Muhammad was killed?&#34; <br /> <br />The Ansari man said, &#34;Even if Muhammad was killed, he has indeed conveyed the Message. Therefore, defend your religion.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ <br /> (Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him), was revealed. <br /> <br />This story was collected by Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in Dala'il An-Nubuwwah. <br /> <br />Allah said next, while chastising those who became weak, <br /> <br />أَفَإِن مَّاتَ أَوْ قُتِلَ انقَلَبْتُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِكُمْ <br /> <br />If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels, <br /> <br />become disbelievers. <br /> <br />وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَىَ عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ اللّهَ شَيْيًا وَسَيَجْزِي اللّهُ الشَّاكِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will give reward to those who are grateful. <br /> <br />those who obeyed Allah, defended His religion and followed His Messenger whether he was alive or dead. <br /> <br />The <b>Sahih</b>, <b>Musnad</b> and <b>Sunan</b> collections gathered various chains of narration stating that Abu Bakr recited this <b>Ayah</b> when the Messenger of Allah died. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Aishah said that; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling in As-Sunh. He dismounted, entered the <b>Masjid</b> and did not speak to anyone until he came to her (in her room) and went directly to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face, knelt down and kissed him, then started weeping and proclaimed, <br /> <br />&#34;My father and my mother be sacrificed for you! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death, which was written for you.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas narrated that; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr then came out, while Umar was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but Umar refused, and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left Umar. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr said, &#34;To proceed; whoever among you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ أَفَإِن مَّاتَ أَوْ قُتِلَ انقَلَبْتُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِكُمْ وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَىَ عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ اللّهَ شَيْيًا وَسَيَجْزِي اللّهُ الشَّاكِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Muhammad is no more than a Messenger and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will reward the grateful.&#34; <br /> <br />The narrator added, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before until Abu Bakr recited it, and then whoever heard it, started reciting it.&#34; <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah! When I heard Abu Bakr recite this <b>Ayah</b>, my feet could not hold me, and I fell to the ground.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 143" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-143/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">144</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>144</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 145" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-145/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
