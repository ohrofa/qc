Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ مِنكُمْ يَوْمَ الْتَقَى الْجَمْعَانِ إِنَّمَا اسْتَزَلَّهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ بِبَعْضِ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا اللّهُ عَنْهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met, Shaytan only caused them to err because of some of what they had earned. But Allah, indeed, has forgiven them. <br /> <br />As for his statement that I remained behind from participating in <b>Badr</b>, I was nursing Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, until she passed away. The Messenger of Allah gave me a share in the booty of <b>Badr</b>, and whoever gets a share in the booty from the Messenger of Allah will have participated in battle. <br /> <br />As for his statement that I abandoned the <b>Sunnah</b> of Umar, neither I nor he are able to endure it. Go and convey this answer to him.&#34;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 154" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-154/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">155</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>155</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 156" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-156/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
