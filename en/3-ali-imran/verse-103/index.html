During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, the Aws and Khazraj were at war and had great hatred, enmity and ill feelings towards each other, causing long conflicts and battles to occur between them. When Allah brought Islam, those among them who embraced it became brothers who loved each other by Allah's grace, having good ties for Allah's sake and helping each other in righteousness and piety. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />هُوَ الَّذِيَ أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِالْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ لَوْ أَنفَقْتَ مَا فِي الَارْضِ جَمِيعاً مَّا أَلَّفَتْ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He it is Who has supported you with His Help and with the believers. And He has united their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah has united them. Certainly He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.(8&#59;62-63) <br /> <br />وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ ايَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His Ayat clear to you, that you may be guided. <br /> <br />Before Islam, their disbelief had them standing at the edge of a pit of the Fire, but Allah saved them from it and delivered them to faith. The Messenger of Allah reminded the <b>Ansar</b> (from both Aws and Khazraj) of this bounty when he was dividing the war booty of Hunayn. During that time, some <b>Ansar</b> did not like the way the booty was divided, since they did not get what the others did, although that was what Allah directed His Prophet to do. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah gave them a speech, in which he said, <br /> <br />يَا مَعْشَرَ الاْاَنْصَارِ أَلَمْ أَجِدْكُمْ ضُلَّلاًا فَهَدَاكُمُ اللهُ بِي <br /> <br />وَكُنْتُمْ مُتَفَرِّقِينَ فَأَلَّفَكُمُ اللهُ بِي <br /> <br /> <br />وَعَالَةً فَأَغْنَاكُمُ اللهُ بِي <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />O <b>Ansar</b>! Did I not find you misguided and Allah directed you to guidance because of me! <br /> <br />Were you not divided beforehand and Allah united you around me! <br /> <br />Were you not poor and Allah enriched you because of me! <br /> <br />Whenever the Prophet asked them a question, they would answer, &#34;Indeed, Allah and His Messenger have granted us bounty.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 102" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-102/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">103</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>103</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 104" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-104/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
