(75&#59;13) <br /> <br />When the servant sees his good deeds, he becomes happy and delighted. When he sees the evil deeds he committed, he becomes sad and angry. Then he will wish that he could disown his evil work and that a long distance separated it from him. He will also say to the devil who used to accompany him in this life, and who used to encourage him to do evil; <br /> <br />يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِيْسَ الْقَرِينُ <br /> <br />&#34;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts ـ a horrible companion (indeed)! (43&#59;38) <br /> <br />وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوَءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدًا بَعِيدًا <br /> <br />and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. <br /> <br />Allah then said, while threatening and warning, <br /> <br />وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللّهُ نَفْسَهُ <br /> <br />And Allah warns you against Himself, <br /> <br />meaning, He warns you against His punishment. <br /> <br />Allah then said, while bringing hope to His servants, so that they do not despair from His mercy or feel hopeless of His kindness, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ رَوُوفُ بِالْعِبَادِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is full of kindness with the servants. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah is so kind with them that He warns them against Himself.&#34; Others commented, &#34;He is merciful with His creation and likes for them to remain on His straight path and chosen religion, and to follow His honorable Messenger.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 29" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">30</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>30</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 31" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
