Rather, Allah disclosed these facts to you as if you were a witness, when they conducted a lottery to choose the custodian of Maryam, seeking the reward of this good deed.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Maryam's mother left with Maryam, carrying her in her infant cloth, and took her to the rabbis from the offspring of Aaron, the brother of Musa. They were responsible for taking care of <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> (the <b>Masjid</b>) at that time, just as there were those who took care of the <b>Ka`bah</b>. <br /> <br />Maryam's mother said to them, `Take this child whom I vowed (to serve the <b>Masjid</b>), I have set her free, since she is my daughter, for no menstruating woman should enter the <b>Masjid</b>, and I shall not take her back home.' <br /> <br />They said, `She is the daughter of our Imam,' as Imran used to lead them in prayer, `who took care of our sacrificial rituals.' <br /> <br />Zakariyya said, `Give her to me, for her maternal aunt is my wife.' <br /> <br />They said, `Our hearts cannot bear that you take her, for she is the daughter of our Imam.' So they conducted a lottery with the pens with which they wrote the <b>Tawrah</b>, and Zakariyya won the lottery and took Maryam into his care.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ikrimah, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, and several others said that; <br /> <br />the rabbis went into the Jordan river and conducted a lottery there, deciding to throw their pens into the river. The pen that remained afloat and idle would indicate that its owner would take care of Maryam. <br /> <br />When they threw their pens into the river, the water took all the pens under, except Zakariyya's pen, which remained afloat in its place. <br /> <br />Zakariyya was also their master, chief, scholar, Imam and Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him and the rest of the Prophets</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 43" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 45" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
