She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests, the keepers of the Holy House [of Jerusalem] and said&#59; `This here before you is the dedication [I offered]'. They competed for [guardianship of] her, because she was the daughter of their religious leader, at which point Zachariah said, `I am most worthy of her, for, her maternal aunt lives with me'. The others said, `No, [not until] we have cast lots'. Thus, all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan, where they cast their quills, agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of [being guardian over] her. Zachariah's quill remained fast [and surfaced]. He took [charge of] her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple, and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food, drink and oil, and would find her with summer fruits in winter, and winter fruits in summer, just as God says, and Zachariah took charge of her, he took her to him (a variant reading [of kafalah, `he took charge of her'] is kaffalah, `He [God] gave Zachariah charge of her', with Zakariyy', or Zakariyy, in the accusative and `God' as the subject of the verb). Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary, that is, the room, the most noble seat [in the temple], where she was, he found her with provisions. `O Mary,' he said, `Whence comes this to you?' She, still very young, said, `From God, He sends it to me from Paradise,' `Truly God provides, abundant provision, for whomever He will without reckoning', without consequence.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Maryam Grows Up; Her Honor is with Allah</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells; <br /> <br />فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ <br /> <br />So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. <br /> <br />Allah states that He has accepted Maryam as a result of her mother's vow and that, <br /> <br />وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا <br /> <br />He made her grow in a good manner, <br /> <br />meaning, made her conduct becoming, her mannerism delightful and He made her well liked among people. He also made her accompany the righteous people, so that she learned righteousness, knowledge and religion. <br /> <br />وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا <br /> <br />And put her under the care of Zakariyya, <br /> <br />meaning, Allah made Zakariyya her sponsor. <br /> <br />Allah made Zakariyya Maryam's guardian for her benefit, so that she would learn from his tremendous knowledge and righteous conduct. He was the husband of her maternal aunt, as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Jarir stated, or her brother-in-law, as mentioned in the <b>Sahih</b>, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا بِيَحْيَى وَعِيسى وَهُمَا ابْنَا الْخَالَة <br /> <br />I saw John and `Isa, who are maternal cousins. <br /> <br />We should state that in general terms, what Ibn Ishaq said is plausible, and in this case, Maryam was under the care of her maternal aunt. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah decided that Amarah, the daughter of Hamzah, be raised by her maternal aunt, the wife of Jafar bin Abi Talib, saying, <br /> <br />الْخَالَةُ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الاُْم <br /> <br />The maternal aunt is just like the mother. <br /> <br />Allah then emphasizes Maryam's honor and virtue at the place of worship she attended, <br /> <br />كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقاً <br /> <br />Every time he entered the <b>Mihrab</b> to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Atiyah Al-Awfi and As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;He would find with her the fruits of the summer during winter, and the fruits of the winter during summer.&#34; <br /> <br />When Zakariyya would see this; <br /> <br />قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;O Maryam! From where have you gotten this!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, where did you get these fruits from! <br /> <br />قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />She said, &#34;This is from Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />إنَّ اللّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَاء بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 36" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-36/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">37</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>37</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 38" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-38/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
