Therefore, they say, do not expose your knowledge to Muslims in order to prevent them from believing in it and, thus, use it as proof against you. <br /> <br />Allah replied, <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّ الْهُدَى هُدَى اللّهِ <br /> <br />Say&#59;(O Prophet) &#34;Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah guides the hearts of the faithful to the perfect faith through the clear <b>Ayat</b>, plain proofs and unequivocal evidence that He has sent down to His servant and Messenger Muhammad. This occurs, O you Jews, even though you hide the description of Muhammad. the unlettered Prophet whom you find in your Books that you received from the earlier Prophets. <br /> <br />Allah's statement; <br /> <br />أَن يُوْتَى أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَا أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَأجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />(And they say&#59;) &#34;Do not believe that anyone can receive like that which you have received, otherwise they would engage you in argument before your Lord.&#34; <br /> <br />They say, &#34;Do not disclose the knowledge that you have to the Muslims, to prevent them from learning it and thus becoming your equals. They will be even better because they will believe in it or will use it against you as evidence with your Lord, and thus establish Allah's proof against you in this life and the Hereafter.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّ الْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ اللّهِ يُوْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;All the bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants to whom He wills. <br /> <br />meaning, all affairs are under His control, and He gives and takes. Verily, Allah gives faith, knowledge and sound comprehension to whomever He wills. He also misguides whomever He wills by blinding his sight, mind, sealing his heart, hearing and stamping his eyes closed. Allah has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proofs. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.&#34; <br /> <br />يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَاء وَاللّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 72" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">73</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>73</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 74" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
