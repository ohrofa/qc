This is why Allah, the Most High, Most Honored, said, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللّهُ مِيثَاقَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَا اتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying&#59;&#34;Take whatever I gave you from the Book and <b>Hikmah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, if I give you the Book and the <b>Hikmah</b>, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ جَاءكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُوْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكُمْ إِصْرِي <br /> <br />&#34;and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, &#34;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up <b>Isri</b>!&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />`<b>Isri</b>' means, &#34;My covenant.&#34; <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that, <b> <br />إِصْرِي <br /></b> (<b>Isri</b>) means, <br /> <br />&#34;The responsibility of My covenant that you took,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, the ratified pledge that you gave Me. <br /> <br />قَالُواْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَاشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُم مِّنَ الشَّاهِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;We agree.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses.&#34; <br /> <br />فَمَن تَوَلَّى بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 80" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-80/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">81</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>81</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 82" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=3,sura_dir="ali-imran",count_ayat=200,number_aya=81;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
