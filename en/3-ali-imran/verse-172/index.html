After the idolators defeated the Muslims (at <b>Uhud</b>), they started on their way back home, but soon they were concerned because they did not finish off the Muslims in Al-Madinah, so they set out to make that battle the final one. When the Messenger of Allah got news of this, he commanded the Muslims to march to meet the disbelievers, to bring fear to their hearts and to demonstrate that the Muslims still had strength to fight. <br /> <br />The Prophet only allowed those who were present during <b>Uhud</b> to accompany him, except for Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, as we will mention. The Muslims mobilized, even though they were still suffering from their injuries, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the idolators returned (towards Makkah) after <b>Uhud</b>, they said, `You neither killed Muhammad nor collected female captives. Woe to you for what you did. Let us go back.' <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah heard this news, he mobilized the Muslim forces, and they marched until they reached <b>Hamra Al-Asad</b>. <br /> <br />The idolators said, `Rather, we will meet next year', and the Messenger of Allah went back (to Al-Madinah), and this was considered a <b>Ghazwah</b> (battle). Allah sent down, <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُواْ لِلّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ مِن بَعْدِ مَأ أَصَابَهُمُ الْقَرْحُ <br /> <br />لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَاتَّقَواْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger after being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared Allah, there is a great reward. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Aishah said to Urwah about the <b>Ayah</b>; <br />الَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُواْ لِلّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ <br /> (Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger), <br /> <br />&#34;My nephew! Your fathers Az-Zubayr and Abu Bakr were among them. <br /> <br />After the Prophet suffered the calamity at <b>Uhud</b> and the idolators went back, he feared that the idolators might try to come back and he said, `Who would follow them?' <br /> <br />Seventy men, including Az-Zubayr and Abu Bakr, volunteered.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari alone. <br /> <br />As for Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 171" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-171/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">172</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>172</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 173" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-173/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=3,sura_dir="ali-imran",count_ayat=200,number_aya=172;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
