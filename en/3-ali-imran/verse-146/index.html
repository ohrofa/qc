What they suffered in <b>Jihad</b> in Allah's cause and for the sake of their religion did not make them lose heart. This is patience, <b> <br />وَاللّهُ يُحِبُّ الصَّابِرِينَ <br /></b> (and Allah loves the patient).&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suhayli agreed with this explanation and defended it vigorously. <br /> <br />This view is supported by Allah saying; <br /> مَعَهُ رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ <br /> (And along with him many <b>Ribbiyyun</b>). <br /> <br />In his book about the battles, Al-Amawi mentioned only this explanation for the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that, Ibn Mas`ud said that, <br /> <br /> رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ <br /> (many <b>Ribbiyyun</b>) means, thousands. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi and Ata Al-Khurasani said that; <br /> <br />the word <b>Ribbiyyun</b> means, `large bands'. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mmar said that Al-Hasan said that, <br /> <br /> رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ <br /> (many <b>Ribbiyyun</b>) means, many scholars. <br /> <br />He also said that it means patient and pious scholars. <br /> <br />فَمَا وَهَنُواْ لِمَا أَصَابَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَمَا ضَعُفُواْ وَمَا اسْتَكَانُواْ <br /> <br />But they never lost heart for that which befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken nor degrade themselves. <br /> <br />Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas said that, <br /> <br />وَمَا ضَعُفُواْ <br /> (nor did they weaken), <br /> <br />means, after their Prophet was killed. <br /> <br />وَمَا اسْتَكَانُواْ <br /> (nor degrade themselves), <br /> <br />by reverting from the true guidance and religion. Rather, they fought on the path that Allah's Prophet fought on until they met Allah. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that, <br />وَمَا اسْتَكَانُواْ <br /> (nor degrade themselves) means, <br /> <br />nor became humiliated, <br /> <br />while As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that it means, <br /> <br />they did not give in to the enemy. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُحِبُّ الصَّابِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ قَوْلَهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ربَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَإِسْرَافَنَا فِي أَمْرِنَا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 145" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-145/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">146</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>146</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 147" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-147/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
