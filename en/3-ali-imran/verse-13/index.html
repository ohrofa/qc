You have an <b>Ayah</b>, meaning proof, that Allah will make His religion prevail, award victory to His Messenger, make His Word apparent and His religion the highest. <br /> <br />فِي فِيَتَيْنِ <br /> <br />In the two armies, <br /> <br />meaning, two camps, <br /> <br />الْتَقَتَا <br /> <br />that met, <br /> <br />in combat (in <b>Badr</b>). <br /> <br />فِيَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, (the Muslims), <br /> <br />وَأُخْرَى كَافِرَةٌ <br /> <br />And as for the other, in disbelief. <br /> <br />meaning, the idolators of Quraysh at <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يَرَوْنَهُم مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ <br /> <br />They saw them with their own eyes twice their number, <br /> <br />means, the idolators thought that the Muslims were twice as many as they were, for Allah made this illusion a factor in the victory that Islam had over them. <br /> <br />It was said that the meaning of Allah's statement, <b> <br />يَرَوْنَهُم مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ <br /></b> (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number), <br /> <br />is that the Muslims saw twice as many idolators as they were, yet Allah gave them victory over the disbelievers. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;When we looked at the disbelievers' forces, we found that they were twice as many as we were. When we looked at them again, we thought they did not have one man more than we had. So Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ الْتَقَيْتُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلً وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِهِمْ <br /> <br />And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as few in their eyes.&#34; (8&#59;44) <br /> <br />When the two camps saw each other, the Muslims thought that the idolators were twice as many as they were, so that they would trust in Allah and seek His help. The idolators thought that the believers were twice as many as they were, so that they would feel fear, horror, fright and despair. When the two camps stood in lines and met in battle, Allah made each camp look smaller in the eyes of the other camp, so that they would be encouraged to fight each other, <br /> <br />لِّيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained. (8&#59;42), <br /> <br />meaning, so that the truth and falsehood are distinguishable, and thus the word of faith prevails over disbelief and deviation, so that the believers prevail and the disbelievers are humiliated. <br /> <br />In a similar statement, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ <br /> <br />And Allah has already made you victorious at <b>Badr</b>, when you were a weak little force. (3&#59;123) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b> Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُوَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَاء إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لاَُّوْلِي الَابْصَارِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand. <br /> <br />meaning, this should be an example for those who have intelligence and sound comprehension. They should contemplate about Allah's wisdom, decisions and decree, that He gives victory to His believing servants in this life and on the Day the witnesses stand up to testify</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Ali &#39;Imran Verse 12" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>13</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Ali &#39;Imran Verse 14" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=3,sura_dir="ali-imran",count_ayat=200,number_aya=13;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
