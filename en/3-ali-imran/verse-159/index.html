It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you (to be rightly guided, to repent to Allah); for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. (9&#59;128) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّواْ مِنْ حَوْلِكَ <br /> <br />And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; <br /> <br />The severe person is he who utters harsh words, and, <br />غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ <br /> (harsh-hearted) is the person whose heart is hard. <br /> <br />Had this been the Prophet's behavior, &#34;They would have scattered from around you. However, Allah gathered them and made you kind and soft with them, so that their hearts congregate around you.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Amr said that he read the description of the Messenger of Allah in previous Books, <br /> <br />&#34;He is not severe, harsh, obscene in the marketplace or dealing evil for evil. Rather, he forgives and pardons.&#34; <br /><b>The Order for Consultation and to Abide by it</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِي الَامْرِ <br /> <br />So pardon them, and ask (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah used to ask his Companions for advice about various matters, to comfort their hearts, and so they actively implement the decision they reach. <br /> <br />For instance, before the battle of <b>Badr</b>, the Prophet asked his Companions for if Muslims should intercept the caravan (led by Abu Sufyan). They said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! If you wish to cross the sea, we would follow you in it, and if you march forth to Barkul-Ghimad we would march with you. We would never say what the Children of Israel said to Musa, `So go, you and your Lord, and fight you two, we are sitting right here.' Rather, we say march forth and we shall march forth with you; and before you, and to your right and left shall we fight.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet also asked them for their opinion about where they should set up camp at <b>Badr</b>. Al-Mundhir bin `Amr suggested to camp close to the enemy, for he wished to acquire martyrdom. <br /> <br />Concerning the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, the Messenger asked the Companions if they should fortify themselves in Al-Madinah or go out to meet the enemy, and the majority of them requested that they go out to meet the enemy, and he did. <br /> <br />He also took their advice on the day of <b>Khandaq</b> (the Trench) about conducting a peace treaty with some of the tribes of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), in return for giving them one-third of the fruits of Al-Madinah. However, Sa`d bin Ubadah and Sa`d bin Mu`adh rejected this offer and the Prophet went ahead with their advice. <br /> <br />The Prophet also asked them if they should attack the idolators on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, and Abu Bakr disagreed, saying, &#34;We did not come here to fight anyone. Rather, we came to perform <b>Umrah</b>.&#34; The Prophet agreed. <br /> <br />On the day of <b>Ifk</b>, (i.e. the false accusation), the Messenger of Allah said to them, &#34;O Muslims! Give me your advice about some men who falsely accused my wife (Aishah). By Allah! I never knew of any evil to come from my wife. And they accused whom They accused he from whom I only knew righteous conduct, by Allah!&#34; The Prophet asked Ali and Usamah about divorcing Aishah. <br /> <br />In summary, the Prophet used to take his Companions' advice for battles and other important events. <br /> <br />Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said; <br /> <br />الْمُسْتَشَارُ مُوْتَمَن <br /> <br />The one whom advice is sought from is to be entrusted. <br /> <br />This was recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i who graded it <b>Hasan</b>. <br /><b>Trust in Allah After Taking the Decision</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا عَزَمْتَ فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّهِ <br /> <br />Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, <br /> <br />means, if you conduct the required consultation and you then make a decision, trust in Allah over your decision. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَوَكِّلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him). <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 158" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-158/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">159</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>159</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 160" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-160/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=3,sura_dir="ali-imran",count_ayat=200,number_aya=159;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
