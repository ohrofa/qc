This resulted from their disobedience and their habit of transgression.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>They shall be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through a rope from God, and a rope from the people; and they incurred wrath from God, and were stricken with misery. That is because they rejected God’s revelations, and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and committed aggression.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Abasement shall be cast upon them, wherever they are found, so that they have no strength and no protection, save, if they be [clinging to], a rope of God, and a rope of the, believing, people, this being the latter's covenant of security for them on the condition that they pay the jizya, in other words, they have no protection other than this; they have incurred, they have ended up, with anger from God, and poverty shall be cast upon them; that, is, because they disbelieved in God's signs, and slew the prophets without right; that (dhlika is [repeated] for emphasis), is, because they disobeyed, God's command, and used to transgress, passing from what is lawful into what is unlawful.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ أَيْنَ مَا ثُقِفُواْ إِلاَّ بِحَبْلٍ مِّنْ اللّهِ وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ النَّاسِ <br /> <br />Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah, and a covenant from men; <br /> <br />meaning, Allah has placed humiliation and disgrace on them wherever they may be, and they will never be safe, <br />إِلاَّ بِحَبْلٍ مِّنْ اللّهِ <br /> (except when under a covenant from Allah), under the <b>Dhimmah</b> (covenant of protection) from Allah that requires them to pay the <b>Jizyah</b> (tax, to Muslims,) and makes them subservient to Islamic Law. <br /> <br />وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ النَّاسِ <br /> (and a covenant from men); <br /> <br />meaning, covenant from men, such as pledges of protection and safety offered to them by Muslim men and women, and even a slave, according to one of the sayings of the scholars. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that, <br />إِلاَّ بِحَبْلٍ مِّنْ اللّهِ وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ النَّاسِ <br /> (except when under a covenant from Allah, and a covenant from men); <br /> <br />refers to a covenant of protection from Allah and a pledge of safety from people. <br /> <br />Similar was said by Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ata, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi bin Anas. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَبَأوُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللّهِ <br /> <br />they have drawn on themselves the wrath of Allah, <br /> <br />means, they earned Allah's anger, which they deserved. <br /> <br />وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَسْكَنَةُ <br /> <br />and destitution is put over them, <br /> <br />meaning they deserve it by decree and legislatively. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِأيَاتِ اللّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ الَانبِيَاء بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ <br /> <br />This is because they disbelieved in the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and killed the Prophets without right. <br /> <br />meaning, what drove them to this was their arrogance, transgression and envy, earning them humiliation, degradation and disgrace throughout this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This is because they disobeyed and used to transgress (the limits set by Allah). <br /> <br />meaning, what lured them to disbelieve in Allah's <b>Ayat</b> and kill His Messengers, is the fact that they often disobeyed Allah's commands, committed His prohibitions and transgressed His set limits. <br /> <br />We seek refuge from this behavior, and Allah Alone is sought for each and every type of help</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 111" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>112</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 113" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
