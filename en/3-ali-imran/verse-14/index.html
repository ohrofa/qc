When the purpose for having children is to reproduce and increase the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad with those who worship Allah alone without partners, then it is encouraged and praised. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />تَزَوَّجُوا الْوَدُودَ الْوَلُودَ فَإِنِّي مُكَاثِرٌ بِكُمُ الاُْمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Marry the <b>Wadud</b> (kind) and <b>Walud</b> (fertile) woman, for I will compare your numbers to the rest of the nations on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />The desire of wealth sometimes results out of arrogance, and the desire to dominate the weak and control the poor, and this conduct is prohibited. Sometimes, the want for more money is for the purpose of spending it on acts of worship, being kind to the family, the relatives, and spending on various acts of righteousness and obedience; this behavior is praised and encouraged in the religion. <br /> <br />Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions about the amount of the <b>Qintar</b>, all of which indicate that; <br /> <br />the <b>Qintar</b> is a large amount of money, as Ad-Dahhak and other scholars said. <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah said <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Qintar</b> is twelve thousand <b>Uwqiyah</b>, each <b>Uwqiyah</b> is better than what is between the heavens and earth.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />The desire to have horses can be one of three types. <br /> <br />Sometimes, owners of horses collect them to be used in the cause of Allah, and when warranted, they use their horses in battle. This type of owner shall be rewarded for this good action. <br /> <br />Another type collects horses to boast, and out of enmity to the people of Islam, and this type earns a burden for his behavior. <br /> <br />Another type collects horses to fulfill their needs and to collect their offspring, and they do not forget Allah's right due on their horses. <br /> <br />This is why in this case, these horses provide a shield of sufficiency for their owner, as evident by a <b>Hadith</b> that we will mention, Allah willing, when we explain Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَأَعِدُّواْ لَهُمْ مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم مّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رّبَاطِ الْخَيْلِ <br /> <br />And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war. (8&#59;60) <br /> <br />As for the <b>Musawwamah</b> horses, Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />they are the branded, beautiful horses. <br /> <br />This is the same explanation of Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abdur-Rahman bin Abdullah bin Abza, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Abu Sinan and others. <br /> <br />Makhul said, <br /> <br />the <b>Musawwamah</b> refers to the horse with a white spotted faced, and the horse with white feet. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ مِنْ فَرَسٍ عَرَبِيَ إِلاَّ يُوْذَنُ لَهُ مَعَ كُلِّ فَجْرٍ يَدْعُو بِدَعْوَتَيْنِ يَقُولُ اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ خَوَّلْتَنِي مِنْ بَنِي ادَمَ فَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ أَحَبِّ مَالِهِ وَأَهْلِهِ إِلَيْهِ أَوْ أَحَبَّ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ إِلَيْه <br /> <br />Every Arabian horse is allowed to have two supplications every dawn, and the horse supplicates, `O Allah! You made me subservient to the son of Adam. Therefore, make me among the dearest of his wealth and household to him, or,make me the dearest of his household and wealth to him. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَالَانْعَامِ <br /> <br />Cattle, <br /> <br />means, camels, cows and sheep. <br />. <br />وَالْحَرْثِ <br /> <br />And fertile land, <br /> <br />meaning, the land that is used to farm and grow plants. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />This is the pleasure of the present world's life, <br /> <br />meaning, these are the delights of this life and its short lived joys. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَأبِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But Allah has the excellent return with Him. <br /> <br />meaning, the best destination and reward. <br /><b>The Reward of the Those Who Have Taqwa is Better Than All Joys of This World</b> <br /> <br />This is why Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 13" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">14</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>14</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 15" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
