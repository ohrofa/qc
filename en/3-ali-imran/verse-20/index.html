the Scripture and [to] the unlearned, &#34;Have you submitted yourselves?&#34; And if they submit [in Islam], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J.

And say to those who have been given the Book and to the common folk: 'Have you surrendered?' If they have surrendered, they are right guided; but if they turn their backs, thine it is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>if they argue with you [Prophet], say, ‘I have devoted myself to God alone and so have my followers.’ Ask those who were given the Scripture, as well as those without one, ‘Do you too devote yourselves to Him alone?’ If they do, they will be guided, but if they turn away, your only duty is to convey the message. God is aware of His servants.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Wherefore if they contend with thee, say thou: have surrendered myself unto Allah and he who followeth me. And say thou unto those who have been vouchsafed the Book and unto the illiterates; do you (also) accept Islam? Then if they accept Islam, they are of a surety guided; and if they turn away, then upon thee is only the preaching, and Allah is Beholder of His bondsmen.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>So if they dispute with thee, say&#59; &#34;I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.&#34; And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned&#59; &#34;Do ye (also) submit yourselves?&#34; If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>And if they remonstrate with you, tell them: 'I have submitted my whole being to Allah, and so have those who follow me.' And ask the People of the Book as well as those who follow no heavenly Scripture: 'Have you also submitted (to Allah)?' If they have submitted to Him, they are indeed on the right way but if they deviate from submitting to Allah, then your duty is merely to deliver the message. Allah observes the affairs of His servants.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Even then if they argue, tell them: &#34;I have bowed in submission to God, and so have my followers.&#34; And tell the people of the Book and the Arabs: &#34;Do you submit?&#34; If they do, they will find the right path; if they turn away, your duty is to deliver the message. And God keeps an eye on His votaries.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>Then if they argue with you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “I have submitted my face (self) to Allah and likewise have my followers”; and say to the People given the Book(s) and the illiterate, “Have you submitted (accepted Islam)?” If they submit, they have attained the right path – and if they turn away (reject), then your duty is only to convey this command; and Allah is seeing the bondmen.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>If they argue with you, say, ‘I have submitted my will to Allah, and [so has] he who follows me.’ And say to those who were given the Book and the uninstructed ones, ‘Do you submit?’ If they submit, they will certainly be guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is only to communicate, and Allah watches His servants.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>If they still remonstrate with you, say (to them, O Messenger): &#34;I have submitted my whole being to God, and so have those who follow me.&#34; And ask those who were given the Book before, and the common folk who know nothing about the Book: &#34;Have you also submitted (to God)?&#34; If they have submitted, then they are indeed rightly guided; but if they turn away, then what rests with you is only to convey the Message fully. God sees the servants well.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>But if they dispute with you say, `I have completely submitted myself to (the will and guidance of) Allâh and (so have) those who follow me.´ And say to those who had been given the Scripture and to the unlettered, `Have you also submitted yourselves?´ Indeed, they will be following true guidance if they submit themselves (to the will of God). But if they turn back then your responsibility is only to convey (the message). Allâh is Ever Watchful of His servants.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>So if they argued/quarreled with you so say: &#34;I submitted/surrendered my face/front to God and who followed me.&#34; And say to those who were given The Book and the illiterates/belongers to a nation : &#34;Did you submit/surrender?&#34; So if they submitted/surrendered/became Moslem, so they had been guided, and if they turned, so but on you (is) the information/communication, and God (is) with the worshippers seeing/knowing .</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>Then if they argue with you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed - peace and blessings be upon him) say, “I have submitted my face (self) to Allah and likewise have my followers”; and say to the People given the Book(s) and the illiterate, “Have you submitted (accepted Islam)?” If they submit, they have attained the right path - and if they turn away (reject), then your duty is only to convey this command; and Allah is seeing the bondmen.</p></div><div id="hamid-s-aziz"><h3><span>13</span> Hamid S.

But if they turn their backs, then your duty is only to convey the message unto them. Allah is Seer of His servants.</p></div><div id="hilali"><h3><span>14</span> Hilali & Khan</h3><p>So if they dispute with you (Muhammad SAW) say: &#34;I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me.&#34; And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): &#34;Do you (also) submit yourselves (to Allah in Islam)?&#34; If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) slaves.</p></div><div id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><h3><span>15</span> Maulana Mohammad Ali</h3><p>Surely the (true) religion with Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Book differed only after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the messages of Allah -- Allah indeed is Quick at reckoning.</p></div><div id="shakir"><h3><span>16</span> Mohammad Habib Shakir</h3><p>But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants.</p></div><div id="pickthall"><h3><span>17</span> Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</h3><p>And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen.</p></div><div id="sarwar"><h3><span>18</span> Muhammad Sarwar</h3><p>(Muhammad), if the People of the Book argue against you, say, &#34;I and those who follow me have submitted ourselves to God.&#34; Ask the People of the Book and the illiterate ones, &#34;Have you embraced Islam?&#34; If they embrace Islam, they will find guidance but if they turn away, your task is just to preach. God knows all about His servants.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>If they argue with you, say: 'I have submitted my face to Allah and so have those who follow me' To those who have received the Book (Jews and Nazarenes) and to the ignorant, ask: 'Have you submitted yourselves to Allah' If they became Muslims they were guided, if they turn away, then your only duty is to warn them. Allah is watching over all His worshipers.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>So if they dispute with you say: &#34;I have submitted myself to Allah, and (so have) those who follow me.&#34; And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterate (Arab pagans): &#34;Do you (also) submit yourselves&#34; If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah sees the servants.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>If they dispute with you, say, &#34;I have submitted my whole being to God and so have those who follow me.&#34; And ask those who have been given the Book, as well as the unlettered, &#34;Do you submit yourselves to God in the same way?&#34; If they submit themselves to Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message. God is observant of all His servants.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>If they argue with you, say, “I have surrendered myself to God, and those who follow me.” And say to those who were given the Scripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you surrendered?” If they have surrendered, then they are guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is to convey. God is Seeing of the servants.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>So if they, the disbelievers, dispute with you, O Muhammad (s), concerning religion, say, to them&#59; `I have surrendered my countenance to God, [that is to say] I have submitted to Him, I, and whoever follows me' (wajh, `countenance', is chosen here because of its noble character, for the other [parts of the body] will just as soon [surrender once the countenance has]); and say to those who have been given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, and to the uninstructed, the Arab idolaters&#59; `Have you submitted?', that is to say, `Submit!' And so if they have submitted, they have been guided, from error, but if they turn their backs, to Islam, your duty is only to deliver, the Message; and God sees His servants, and so requites them for their deeds -- this [statement] was [revealed] before the command to fight [them] had been revealed.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَإنْ حَأجُّوكَ <br /> <br />So if they dispute with you (Muhammad), <br /> <br />so if they argue with you about <b>Tawhid</b>. <br /> <br />فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلّهِ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, Say, `I have made my worship sincere for Allah Alone without partners, rivals, offspring or companion, <br />وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ <br /> (and those who follow me) who followed my religion and embraced my creed.' <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلْ هَـذِهِ سَبِيلِى أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ عَلَى بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَاْ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِى <br /> <br />Say (O Muhammad)&#59;&#34;This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me...&#34; (12&#59;108) <br /><b>Islam is the Religion of Mankind and the Prophet Was Sent to all Mankind</b> <br /> <br />Allah commanded His servant and Messenger, Muhammad, to call the People of the Two Scriptures and the unlettered idolators to his religion, way, Law and all that Allah sent him with. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ أُوْتُواْ الْكِتَابَ وَالاُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَغُ <br /> <br />And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans)&#59;&#34;Do you (also) submit yourselves!&#34; If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message. <br /> <br />meaning, their reckoning is with Allah and their return and final destination is to Him. It is He Who guides whom He wills and allows whom He wills to stray, and He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof for all of this. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah sees the servants. <br /> <br />for He has perfect knowledge of who deserves to be guided and who does not deserve to be guided. Verily, <b> <br />لَاا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ <br /></b> (He cannot be questioned for what He does, while they will be questioned) (21&#59;23) because of His perfect wisdom and mercy. <br /> <br />This and similar <b>Ayat</b> are clear proofs that the Message of Muhammad is universal to all creation, as it is well established in the religion, according to the various texts of the Book and <b>Sunnah</b>. For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />Say (O Muhammad)&#59;&#34;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.&#34; (7&#59;158) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً <br /> <br />Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to the <b>Alamin</b> (mankind and Jinn). (25&#59;1) <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> and other collections of <b>Hadith</b> recorded that; <br /> <br />the Prophet sent letters to the kings of the earth during his time and to different peoples, Arabs and non-Arabs, People of the Book and the unlettered, just as Allah had commanded him. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said, that Hammam said that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَاا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الاْاُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَاا نَصْرَانِيٌّ وَمَاتَ وَلَمْ يُوْمِنْ بِالَّذِي أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ إِلاَّ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّار <br /> <br />By He in Whose Hand is my soul! No member of this <b>Ummah</b>, no Jew or Christian, hears of me but dies without believing in what I was sent with, but will be among the people of the Fire. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الاَْحْمَرِ وَالاَْسْوَد <br /> <br />I was sent to the red and black. <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />كَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة <br /> <br />A Prophet used to be sent to his people, but I was sent to all mankind.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 19" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 21" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
