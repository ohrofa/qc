Nay, it will be worse for them. <br /> <br />Therefore, the <b>Ayah</b> says that the miser should not think that collecting money will benefit him. Rather, it will harm him in his religion and worldly affairs. <br /> <br />Allah mentions the money that the miser collected on the Day of Resurrection, <br /> <br />سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُواْ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /> <br />the things that they stingy with shall be tied to their necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ اتَاهُ اللهُ مَالاً فَلَمْ يُوَدِّ زَكَاتَهُ مُثِّلَ لَهُ شُجَاعًا أَقْرَعَ لَهُ زَبِيبَتَانِ يُطَوَّقُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَأْخُذُ بِلِهْزِمَتَيْهِ يَعْنِي بِشِدْقَيْهِ يَقُولُ أَنَا مَالُكَ أَنَا كَنْزُك <br /> <br />Whoever Allah makes wealthy and he does not pay the <b>Zakah</b> due on his wealth, then (on the Day of Resurrection) his wealth will be made in the likeness of a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes. The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and proclaim, `I am your wealth, I am your treasure.' <br /> <br />The Prophet then recited the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَحْسَبَنَّ الَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ بِمَا اتَاهُمُ اللّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ هُوَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ بَلْ هُوَ شَرٌّ لَّهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />And let not those who are stingy with that which Allah has bestowed on them of His bounty think that it is good for them. Nay, it will be worse for them, until the end. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, but not Muslim, collected this <b>Hadith</b> using this chain of narration, Ibn Hibban also collected it in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍلَاا يُوَدِّي زَكَاةَ مَالِهِ إِلاَّ جُعِلَ لَهُ شُجَاعٌ أَقْرَعُ يَتْبَعُهُ يَفِرُّ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ يَتْبَعُهُ فَيَقُولُ أَنَا كَنْزُك <br /> <br />Every person who does not pay the <b>Zakah</b> due on his wealth, will have his money made into the shape of a bald-headed, poisonous male snake who will follow him. The person will run away from the snake, who will follow him and proclaim, `I am your treasure.' <br /> <br />Abdullah then recited the <b>Ayah</b> in Allah's Book that testifies to this fact, <b> <br />سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُواْ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /></b> (the things that they were stingy with shall be tied to their necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection). <br /> <br />This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, and At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلِلّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالَارْضِ <br /> <br />And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the Earth, <br /> <br />means, <br />وَأَنفِقُوا مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ <br /> (and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees), (57&#59;7). <br /> <br />Therefore, since all affairs are under Allah's control, then spend from your money so it will benefit you on the Day of Return. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and Allah is Well-Acquainted with all that you do. <br /> <br />with your intentions and what your hearts conceal</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 179" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-179/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">180</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>180</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 181" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-181/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
