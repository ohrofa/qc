Gabriel breathed into the opening of her garment and she became pregnant. What happened to her after this is mentioned later in srat Maryam [Q. 19&#59;21ff]. Thus, when God sent him to the Children of Israel, he said to them, `I am God's Messenger to you', and, `I have come to you with a sign, an indication of my truthfulness, from your Lord, and it is that, I will create (a variant reading for [the particle introducing the relative clause] ann, `that I', has inn, `truly I', indicating a new [independent] sentence) [that] I will fashion, for you out of clay like the shape of a bird (ka-hay'at, `something like the shape of'&#59; the kf is the subject of a passive participle) then I will breathe into it (fhi, the [suffixed] pronoun [-hi] refers to the [preceding] kf), and it will be a bird (tayran, is also read t'iran) by the leave, the will, of God. So he created for them a bat, being the most perfectly-created of birds, and they would watch it flying, but when it went out of sight, it would fall dead -- so that the work of a creature [sc. Jesus] may be distinguished from the work of the Creator, namely, God, exalted be He, and that he might know that perfection belongs to God [alone]. I will also heal the blind (akmah is one that is blind from birth) and the leper; these two are singled out for mention because with both afflictions the person is completely helpless. He [Jesus] was sent in an age of [characterised by] medicinal science, and he cured, through supplication, fifty thousand in one day on the condition that each person would become a believer; and I bring to life the dead, by the leave of God -- He repeats this to preclude any false attributions of divinity to him -- he brought back to life his friend `zar, the son of an old woman, and the daughter of the tithe-collector, all of whom lived on and produced offspring, and [he also brought back to life] Shem, son of Noah, but he died [again] immediately. I will inform you too of what things you eat, and what you treasure up, store, in your houses, and what I have never seen, and he would inform people what they had eaten and what they would eat. Surely in that, mentioned, is a sign for you, if you are believers.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَرَسُولاً إِلَى بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ <br /> <br />And will make him a Messenger to the Children of Israel, <br /> <br />means, that Allah will send `Isa as a Messenger to the Children of Israel, proclaiming to them, <br /> <br />أَنِّي قَدْ جِيْتُكُم بِأيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِّي أَخْلُقُ لَكُم مِّنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْيَةِ الطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah's leave. <br /> <br />These are the miracles that `Isa performed; he used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow into it, and it became a bird by Allah's leave. Allah made this a miracle for `Isa to testify that He had sent him. <br /> <br />وَأُبْرِىءُ الاكْمَهَ <br /> <br />And I heal him who is <b>Akmah</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, `a person who was born blind,' which perfects this miracle and makes the challenge more daring. <br /> <br />والَابْرَصَ <br /> <br />And the leper, <br /> <br />which is a known disease. <br /> <br />وَأُحْيِـي الْمَوْتَى بِإِذْنِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />And I bring the dead to life by Allah's leave. <br /> <br />Many scholars stated that Allah sent every Prophet with a miracle suitable to his time. <br /> <br />For instance, in the time of Musa, magic was the trade of the time, and magicians held a high position. So Allah sent Musa with a miracle that captured the eyes and bewildered every magician. When the magicians realized that Musa's miracle came from the Almighty, Most Great, they embraced Islam and became pious believers. <br /> <br />As for `Isa, he was sent during a time when medicine and knowledge in physics were advancing. `Isa brought them the types of miracles that could not be performed, except by one sent by Allah. How can any physician bring life to clay, cure blindness and leprosy and bring back to life those entrapped in the grave! <br /> <br />Muhammad was sent during the time of eloquent people and proficient poets. He brought them a Book from Allah; if mankind and the Jinn tried to imitate ten chapters, or even one chapter of it, they will utterly fail in this task, even if they tried to do it by collective cooperation. This is because the Qur'an is the Word of Allah and is nothing like that of the creatures. <br /> <br />`Isa's statement, <br /> <br />وَأُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ <br /> <br />And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses, <br /> <br />means, I tell you about what one of you has just eaten and what he is keeping in his house for tomorrow. <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ <br /> <br />Surely, therein, <br /> <br />all these miracles. <br /> <br />لاايَةً لَّكُمْ <br /> <br />is a sign for you, <br /> <br />testifying to the truth of what I was sent to you with. <br /> <br />إِن كُنتُم مُّوْمِنِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 48" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-48/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">49</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>49</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 50" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
