(2&#59;155) <br /> <br />Therefore, the believer shall be tested, in his wealth, himself, his offspring and family. The believer shall be tested according to the degree of his faith, and when his faith is stronger, the test is larger. <br /> <br />وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ أَذًى كَثِيرًا <br /> <br />and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah. <br /> <br />Allah said to the believers upon their arrival at Al-Madinah, before <b>Badr</b>, while comforting them against the harm they suffered from the People of the Scriptures and the polytheists; <br /> <br />وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذَلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الاُمُورِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but if you persevere patiently, and have <b>Taqwa</b>, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs. <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah commanded the believers to be forgiving, patient and forbearing until He brought His awaited aid. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Usamah bin Zayd said that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger rode a donkey with a saddle covered by a velvet sheet and let Usamah ride behind him (on the donkey). The Prophet wanted to visit Sa`d bin Ubadah in Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this occurred before the battle of <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet passed by a gathering in which Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was sitting, before Abdullah bin Ubayy became Muslim. That gathering was made up of various Muslims as well as <b>Mushriks</b>, who worshipped the idols, and some Jews. Abdullah bin Rawahah was sitting in that gathering. <br /> <br />When the Prophet reached Abdullah bin Ubayy, the donkey caused some sand to fall on the group. Then, Abdullah bin Ubayy covered his nose with his robe and said, `Do not fill us with sand.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah greeted the gathering with <b>Salam</b>, called them to Allah and recited some of the Qur'an to them. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Ubayy said, `O fellow! No other speech is better than what you said, if it was true! However, do not bother us in our gatherings. Go back to your place and whoever came to you, narrate your stories to him.' <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Rawahah said, `Rather, O Messenger of Allah! Attend our gatherings for we like that.' <br /> <br />The Muslims, <b>Mushriks</b> and Jews then cursed each other, and they almost fought with each other. The Prophet tried to calm them down, until they finally settled. <br /> <br />The Prophet rode his donkey and went to Sa`d bin Ubadah, saying, `O Sa`d! Have you heard what Abu Hubbab said (meaning Abdullah bin Ubayy)? He said such and such things.' <br /> <br />Sa`d said, `O Messenger of Allah! Forgive and pardon him. By Allah, Who sent down the Book to you, Allah brought us the truth that you came with at a time when the people of this city almost appointed him king. When Allah changed all that with the truth that He gave you, he choked on it, and this is the reason behind the behavior you saw from him.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah forgave him. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to forgive the <b>Mushriks</b> and the People of the Scriptures, just as Allah commanded them, and they used to tolerate the harm that they suffered. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ أَذًى كَثِيرًا <br /> <br />and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah; <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِن بَعْدِ إِيمَـنِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِّنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ فَاعْفُواْ وَاصْفَحُواْ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ <br /> <br />Many of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves, even after the truth has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command. (2&#59;109) <br /> <br />The Prophet used to implement the pardon that Allah commanded him until He gave His command (to fight the disbelievers). <br /> <br />When the Messenger fought at <b>Badr</b>, and Allah killed, by his hand, the leaders of the disbelievers from Quraysh, Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul and the <b>Mushriks</b> and idol worshippers who were with him said, `This matter has prevailed,' and they gave their pledge to the Prophet and became Muslims.&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, every person who stands for truth, enjoins righteousness and forbids evil, will be harmed in some manner. In such cases, there is no cure better than being patient in Allah's cause, trusting in Him and returning to Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 185" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-185/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">186</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>186</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 187" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-187/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
