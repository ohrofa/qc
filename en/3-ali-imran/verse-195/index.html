When Umm Salama asked, `O Messenger of God, why is there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration (hijra)?', the following was revealed&#59; and those who emigrated, from Mecca to Medina, and were expelled from their habitations, those who suffered hurt in My way, for My religion, and fought, the disbelievers, and were slain (read qutil or quttil) -- them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds, concealing these with forgiveness, and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow'. A reward (thawban is a verbal noun reaffirming the import of la-ukaffiranna) from God! (there is a shift of person here). And God -- with Him is the fairest reward, [the fairest] requital.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Allah Accepts the Supplication of Men of Understanding</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ <br /> <br />So their Lord accepted of them, <br /> <br />answered their invocation. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Salamah, a man from the family of Umm Salamah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Umm Salamah said, `O Messenger of Allah! Allah does not mention women in connection with <b>Hijrah</b> (Migration).' <br /> <br />Allah sent down the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّي لَا أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى <br /></b> (So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), &#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female). <br /> <br />The <b>Ansar</b> say that Umm Salamah was the first woman to migrate to them.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hakim collected this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, and said, &#34;It is <b>Sahih</b> according to the criteria of Al-Bukhari but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it&#34;. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَنِّي لَا أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى <br /> <br />&#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female, <br /> <br />explains the type of answer Allah gave them, stating that no deed of any person is ever lost with Him. Rather, He will completely reward each person for his or her good deeds. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />You are (members) one of another, <br /> <br />means, you are all equal in relation to gaining My reward. <br /> <br />Therefore, <br /> <br />فَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ <br /> <br />those who emigrated, <br /> <br />by leaving the land of <b>Shirk</b> and migrating to the land of faith, leaving behind their loved ones, brethren, friends and neighbors. <br /> <br />وَأُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ <br /> <br />and were driven out from their homes, <br /> <br />when the <b>Mushriks</b> tormented them and forced them to migrate. <br /> <br />وَأُوذُواْ فِي سَبِيلِي <br /> <br />and suffered harm in My cause, <br /> <br />for their only wrong, to the people, was that they believed in Allah Alone. <br /> <br />In similar <b>Ayat</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ أَن تُوْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah your Lord! (60&#59;1) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يُوْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ <br /> <br />And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! (85&#59;8) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَقَاتَلُواْ وَقُتِلُواْ <br /> <br />and who fought and were killed (in My cause), <br /> <br />refers to the highest rank there is, that one fights in the cause of Allah and dies in the process, with his face covered in dust and blood. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that a man said, <br /> <br />'O Messenger of Allah! If I was killed in Allah's cause, observing patience, awaiting Allah's reward, attacking, not retreating, would Allah forgive my sins?' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />The Prophet then asked the man, `What did you ask?' <br /> <br />When the man repeated the question, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />نَعَمْ إِلاَّ الدَّيْنَ قَالَهُ لِي جِبْرِيلُ انِفًا <br /> <br />`Yes, except for the debt, for Jibril conveyed this to me right now'. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br /> <br />لاأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّيَاتِهِمْ وَلاأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاأَنْهَارُ <br /> <br />verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, <br /> <br />within Paradise, where there are rivers of various drinks&#59;milk, honey, wine and fresh water. There is what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no heart has ever imagined (of delights in Paradise). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ثَوَابًا مِّن عِندِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />a reward from Allah, <br /> <br />testifies to His might, for the Mighty and Most Great only gives tremendous rewards. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الثَّوَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and with Allah is the best of rewards.&#34; <br /> <br />for those who perform good deeds.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 194" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-194/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> آل عمران<span class="num-ar">3</span> :<span class="num-ar">195</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ali 'Imran<span> 3</span>:<span>195</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ali Imran Verse 196" href="/en/3-ali-imran/verse-196/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
