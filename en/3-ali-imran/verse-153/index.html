Come to me, O servants of Allah!' <br /> <br />Allah mentioned that the Muslims went up the Mount and that the Prophet called them to come back, and said, <b> <br />إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلَا تَلْوُونَ عَلَى أحَدٍ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِي أُخْرَاكُمْ <br /></b> ((And remember) when you ran away without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger was in your rear calling you back).&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi and Ibn Zayd. <br /><b>The Ansar and Muhajirin Defended the Messenger</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Qays bin Abi Hazim said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Talhah's hand, it was paralyzed, because he shielded the Prophet with it.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning on the day of <b>Uhud</b>. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Uthman An-Nahdi said, <br /> <br />&#34;On that day (<b>Uhud</b>) during which the Prophet fought, only Talhah bin Ubaydullah and Sa`d remained with the Prophet.&#34; <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas saying, `The Messenger of Allah gave me arrows from his quiver on the day of <b>Uhud</b> and said, `Shoot, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you.&#34;' <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas said, <br /> <br />&#34;On the day of <b>Uhud</b>, I saw two men wearing white clothes, one to the right of the Prophet and one to his left, who were defending the Prophet fiercely. I have never seen these men before or after that day.&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning angels Jibril and Mika'il, peace be upon them. <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aswad said that, Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ubayy bin Khalaf of Bani Jumah swore in Makkah that he would kill the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />When the Messenger was told of his vow, he said, `Rather, I shall kill him, Allah willing.' <br /> <br />On the day of <b>Uhud</b>, Ubayy came while wearing iron shields and proclaiming, `May I not be saved, if Muhammad is saved.' He then headed to the direction of the Messenger of Allah intending to kill him, but Mus`ab bin Umayr, from Bani Abd Ad-Dar, intercepted him and shielded the Prophet with his body, and Mus`ab bin Umayr was killed. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah saw Ubayy's neck exposed between the shields and helmet, stabbed him with his spear, and Ubayy fell from his horse to the ground. However, no blood spilled from his wound. His people came and carried him away while he was moaning like an ox. <br /> <br />They said to him, `Why are you so anxious, it is only a flesh wound!' <br /> <br />Ubayy mentioned to them the Prophet's vow, `Rather, I shall kill Ubayy', then commented, `By He in Whose Hand is my soul! If what hit me hits the people of Dhul-Majaz (a popular pre-Islamic marketplace), they would all have perished.' He then died and went to the Fire, <br /> <br />فَسُحْقًا لاًّصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ <br /> <br />So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire! (67&#59;11)&#34; <br /> <br />This was collected by Musa bin Uqbah from Az-Zuhri from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahih</b> that; <br /> <br />when he was asked about the injuries the Messenger sustained (in <b>Uhud</b>), Sahl bin Sa`d said, <br /> <br />&#34;The face of Allah's Messenger was injured, his front tooth was broken and his helmet was smashed on his head. Therefore, Fatimah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger washed off the blood while Ali was pouring water on her hand. When Fatimah saw that the bleeding increased more by the water, she took a mat, burnt it, and placed the ashes in the wound of the Prophet and the blood stopped oozing out.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَأَثَابَكُمْ غُمَّاً بِغَمٍّ <br /> <br />There did Allah give you one distress after another, <br /> <br />He gave you grief over your grief. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />The first grief was because of the defeat, especially when it was rumored that Muhammad was killed. <br /> <br />The second grief was when the idolators went up the mount and The Messenger of Allah said, &#34;O Allah! It is not for them to rise above us.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Awf said, <br /> <br />&#34;The first distress was because of the defeat and the second when a rumor started that Muhammad was killed, which to them, was worse than defeat.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Marduwyah recorded both of these. <br /> <br />Mujahid and Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The first distress was when they heard that Muhammad was killed and the second when they suffered casualties and injury.&#34; <br /> <br />It has also been reported that Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas said that; <br /> <br />it was the opposite (order). <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />the first distress was because of the victory and booty that they missed and the second because of the enemy rising above them (on the mount). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لِّكَيْلَ تَحْزَنُواْ عَلَى مَا فَاتَكُمْ <br /> <br />by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, <br /> <br />for that you missed the booty and triumph over your enemy. <br /> <br />وَلَا مَا أَصَابَكُمْ <br /> <br />nor for what struck you, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Abdur-Rahman bin Awf, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi stated, <br /> <br />of injury and fatalities. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is Well-Aware of all that you do. <br /> <br />all praise is due to Him, and thanks, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the Most High, Most Honored</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>Remember, when you were ascending, fleeing in the distance, not turning around, [not] stopping, for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear, saying, `Come to me servants of God, this way, servants of God!', so He rewarded you, He requited you, with grief, through defeat, for grief (ghamman bi- ghamm; the b' [bi-], `with', is said to mean `al, `for') because of the grief that you caused the Prophet when you disobeyed [his command], that is, [with grief] doubled, [being] in addition to the grief of the booty forfeited, so that (li-kayl is semantically connected either to `af, `He has pardoned', or athbakum, `He rewarded you'; the l [of kay-l] is thus extra) you might not grieve for what escaped you, of booty, neither for what befell you, of being slain and [of] defeat; and God is aware of what you do.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back.
