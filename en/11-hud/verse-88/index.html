My success, my ability to do this [successfully] and [to enjoin] other acts of obedience, is only with God. In Him I trust and to Him I turn, I return, [repentant].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Shu`ayb's Refutation of His People</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells; <br /> <br />قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىَ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;O my people! Tell me if I, have a clear evidence from my Lord, <br /> <br />meaning, upon clear guidance in that which I am calling to. <br /> <br />وَرَزَقَنِي مِنْهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا <br /> <br />and He has given me a good sustenance from Himself. <br /> <br />It has been said that he meant the Prophethood. <br /> <br />It has also been said that he meant the lawful provisions. <br /> <br />It seems that the verse carries both meanings. <br /> <br />وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَا أَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ <br /> <br />I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you. <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri said, <br /> <br />meaning, `do not forbid you from something and at the same time I contradict my prohibitions in secret behind your backs, doing what I have forbidden.' <br /> <br />This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />&#34;He is saying, `I do not forbid you all from something while I do it myself.&#34;' <br /> <br />إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ الاِصْلَحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ <br /> <br />I only desire reform to the best of my power. <br /> <br />This means, &#34;In that which I command and forbid you, I only want to correct your affair as much as I am able.&#34; <br /> <br />وَمَا تَوْفِيقِي <br /> <br />And my guidance cannot come, <br /> <br />This means, &#34;In whatever I intend that agrees with the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />إِلاَّ بِاللّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ <br /> <br />except from Allah, in Him I put my trust, <br /> <br />This means in all of my affairs. <br /> <br />وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and unto Him I repent. <br /> <br />meaning; &#34;I return.&#34; <br /> <br />This has been said by Mujahid and others</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 87" href="/en/11-hud/verse-87/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">88</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>88</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 89" href="/en/11-hud/verse-89/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=11,sura_dir="hud",count_ayat=123,number_aya=88;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
