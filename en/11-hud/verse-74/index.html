After this, they gave him the glad tidings of the birth of a son and the destruction of the people of Lut. When they told him of this, he spoke to them as Sa`id bin Jubayr narrated concerning this verse. <br /> <br />Sa`id said&#59; <br /> <br />When Jibril and the other angels who were with him came to Ibrahim, they said, <br /> <br />إِنَّا مُهْلِكُو أَهْلِ هَـذِهِ الْقَرْيَةِ <br /> <br />Verily, we are going to destroy the people of this town. (29&#59;31) <br /> <br />Ibrahim said to them, &#34;Will you destroy a town that has three hundred believers in it?&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />He then said, &#34;Will you destroy a town that has two hundred believers in it?&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Will you destroy a town that has forty believers in it?&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />He then said, &#34;Thirty!&#34; <br /> <br />They still replied, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />This continued until he said, &#34;Five.&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he said, &#34;What do you think if there is one Muslim man in the town, would you destroy it?&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />With this, Ibrahim said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِيهَا لُوطاً قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِيهَا لَنُنَجِّيَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ <br /> <br />But there is Lut in it. They said&#59;&#34;We know better who is there. We will verily, save him and his family except his wife.&#34; (29&#59;32) <br /> <br />Therefore, Ibrahim remained silent and his soul was at rest. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 73" href="/en/11-hud/verse-73/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">74</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>74</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 75" href="/en/11-hud/verse-75/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
