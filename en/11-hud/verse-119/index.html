Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, <br /> <br />This means that people will always differ in religions, creeds, beliefs, opinions and sects. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br />إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ <br /> (Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy), <br /> <br />This means that those who have received the mercy of Allah by following the Messengers are excluded from this. They are those who adhere to what they are commanded in the religion by the Messengers of Allah. <br /> <br />That has always been their characteristic until the coming of the finality of the Prophets and Messengers (Muhammad). Those who received Allah's mercy are those who followed him, believed in him and supported him. Therefore, they succeeded by achieving happiness in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />وَلِذَلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ <br /> <br />and for that did He create them. <br /> <br />They are the Saved Sect mentioned in the <b>Hadith</b> recorded in the <b>Musnad</b> and <b>Sunan</b> collections of <b>Hadith</b>. The routes of transmission of this <b>Hadith</b> all strengthen each other (in authenticity). In these narrations the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الْيَهُودَ افْتَرَقَتْ عَلَى إِحْدَى وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً وَإِنَّ النَّصَارَى افْتَرَقَتْ عَلَى اثْنَتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الاُْمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً كُلُّهَا فِي النَّارِ إِلاَّ فِرْقَةً وَاحِدَة <br /> <br />Verily, the Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, and this nation (of Muslims) will split into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Fire except one sect. <br /> <br />They (the Companions) said, &#34;Who are they (the Saved Sect) O Messenger of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي <br /> <br />The sect that is upon what my Companions and I are upon. <br /> <br />Al-Hakim recorded this narration in his Mustadrak with this additional wording. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَامْلنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (His saying)&#59;&#34;Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, informs that He precedes everything in His preordainment and decree, by His perfect knowledge and penetrating wisdom. The result of this decree is that from those whom He has created, some deserve the Paradise and some deserve the Hell Fire. From this decree is that He will fill the Hellfire with both mankind and Jinns. His is the profound evidence and the perfect wisdom. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b> it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />اخْتَصَمَتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ فَقَالَتِ الْجَنَّةُ مَا لِي لَا يَدْخُلُنِي إِلاَّ ضُعَفَاءُ النَّاسِ وَسَقَطُهُمْ <br /> <br />Paradise and the Hellfire debated. Paradise said, `None will enter me except the weak and despised of the people.' <br /> <br />وَقَالَتِ النَّارُ أُوثِرْتُ بِالْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ وَالْمُتَجَبِّرِينَ <br /> <br />The Hell- fire said, `I have inherited the haughty and the arrogant people.' <br /> <br />فَقَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلْجَنَّةِ أَنْتِ رَحْمَتِي أَرْحَمُ بِكِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ <br /> <br />Then Allah said to the Paradise, `You are My mercy and I grant mercy with you to whoever I wish.' <br /> <br />وَقَالَ لِلنَّارِ أَنْتِ عَذَابِي أَنْتَقِمُ بِكِ مِمَّنْ أَشَاءُ <br /> <br />Then He said to the Hellfire, `You are My torment and I take vengeance with you upon whoever I wish. <br /> <br />وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْكُمَا مِلْوُهَا <br /> <br />I will fill each one of you.' <br /> <br />فَأَمَّا الْجَنَّةُ فَلَأ يَزَالُ فِيهَا فَضْلٌ حَتَّى يُنْشِىءَ اللهُ لَهَا خَلْقًا يُسْكِنُ فَضْلَ الْجَنَّةِ <br /> <br />However, the Paradise will always have more bounties, to such an extent that Allah will create more creatures to dwell in it and enjoy its extra bounties. <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا النَّارُ فَلَأ تَزَالُ تَقُولُ هَلْ مِنْ مَزِيدٍ حَتَّى يَضَعَ عَلَيْهَا رَبُّ الْعِزَّةِ قَدَمَهُ <br /> <br />The Hellfire will continue saying, `Are there anymore (to enter me),' until the Lord of might places His Foot over it. <br /> <br />فَتَقُولُ قَطْ قَطْ وَعِزَّتِك <br /> <br />Then it (Hell) will say, &#34;Enough, enough, by Your might!</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 118" href="/en/11-hud/verse-118/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">119</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>119</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 120" href="/en/11-hud/verse-120/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=11,sura_dir="hud",count_ayat=123,number_aya=119;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
