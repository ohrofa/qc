And <b>As-Sayhah</b>(awful cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (<b>Jathimin</b>) in their homes. <br /> <br />His saying <b>Jathimin</b> means extinct and lifeless without any movement. <br /> <br />Here Allah mentions that a loud cry (<b>Sayhah</b>) came to them. <br /> <br />In Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b> He says a severe quake (<b>Rajfah</b>) came to them. <br /> <br />In Surah <b>Ash-Shu`ara'</b>, He said it was a torment of a cloudy day. <br /> <br />They were one nation upon which all of these punishments were gathered on the day of their destruction. <br /> <br />In each context, Allah only mentioned that which was suitable. In <b>Surah Al-A`raf</b>when they said, <br /> <br />لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَأ <br /> <br />We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town. (7&#59;88) <br /> <br />In this verse it was suitable to mention a tremor, or quake (<b>Rajfah</b>). The earth in which they practiced their wrongdoing and they wanted to expel their Prophet from it, shook them. <br /> <br />Here, due to their disrespectful manners in speaking to their Prophet, Allah mentioned the awful cry (<b>Sayhah</b>) which overcame them and killed them. <br /> <br />In Surah <b>Ash-Shu`ara'</b> when they said, <br /> <br />فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَأءِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ <br /> <br />So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful! (26&#59;187) <br /> <br />Allah said in response, <br /> <br />فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ <br /> <br />So the torment of the day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day. (26&#59;189) <br /> <br />This is from the intricate secrets and to Allah belongs all praise and much bounty forever. <br /> <br />Concerning the statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 93" href="/en/11-hud/verse-93/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">94</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>94</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 95" href="/en/11-hud/verse-95/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=11,sura_dir="hud",count_ayat=123,number_aya=94;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
