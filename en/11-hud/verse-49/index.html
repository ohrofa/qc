Allah revealed it to you (the Prophet ) in the way that it occurred, as if he witnessed it himself. <br /> <br />نُوحِيهَا إِلَيْكَ <br /> <br />which We reveal unto you; <br /> <br />This means, &#34;We teach it to you (Muhammad) as revelation from Us to you.&#34; <br /> <br />مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَا أَنتَ وَلَا قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـذَا <br /> <br />neither you nor your people knew it before this. <br /> <br />This means that neither you (Muhammad) nor anyone of your people, have any knowledge of this. This is so that no one who rejects you can say that you learned it from him. Rather, it was Allah Who informed you of it in conformity with the true situation (of the story), just as the Books of the Prophets who were before you testify to. Therefore, you should be patient with the rejection of your people and their harming you. For verily, We shall help you and surround you with Our aid. Then, We will make the (good) end for you and those who follow you in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />This is what We did with the Messengers when We helped them against their enemies. <br /> <br />إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ امَنُوا <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe. (40&#59;51) <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ <br /> <br />إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ <br /> <br />And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant. (37&#59;171-172) <br /> <br />Then, Allah says, <br /> <br />فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ الْعَاقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have <b>Taqwa</b>.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 48" href="/en/11-hud/verse-48/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">49</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>49</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 50" href="/en/11-hud/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
