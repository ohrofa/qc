Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, explains the condition of those who lie against Him and that their scandal in the Hereafter will be presented before the heads of creation (for testimony) from the angels, Messengers, Prophets and the rest of mankind and Jinns. <br /> <br />This is just as Imam Ahmad recorded from Safwan bin Muhriz. Safwan said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was holding the hand of Ibn Umar when a man was brought to him. The man said, `How did you hear the Messenger of Allah describe <b>An-Najwa</b> (secret counsel or confidential talk) on the Day of Resurrection?&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Umar said, `I heard him say, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ <br /> <br />عزَّ وَجَلَّ يُدْنِي الْمُوْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ وَيَسْتُرُهُ مِنَ النَّاسِ <br /> <br />وَيُقَرِّرُهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُ لَهُ أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا <br /> <br />أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا <br /> <br />أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ قَدْ هَلَكَ <br /> <br />قَالَ فَإِنِّي قَدْ سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَإِنِّي أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْم <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will draw near the believer and He will place His shade over him. He will conceal him from the people and make him confess to his sins. <br /> <br />He will say to him, &#34;Do you recognize this sin? <br /> <br />Do you recognize that sin? <br /> <br />Do you recognize such and such sin?&#34; <br /> <br />This will continue until He makes him confess to all of his sins and he (the believer) will think to himself that he is about to be destroyed. <br /> <br />Then Allah will say, &#34;Verily, I have concealed these sins for you in the worldly life and I have forgiven you for them today.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he (the believer) will be given his Book of good deeds. <br /> <br />As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, the witnesses will say, <br /> <br />هَـوُلاء الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ <br /> <br />أَلَا لَعْنَةُ اللّهِ عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers.&#34; <br /> <br />Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 17" href="/en/11-hud/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">18</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>18</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 19" href="/en/11-hud/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
