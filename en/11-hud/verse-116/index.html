They were those whom Allah saved at the sudden striking of His vengeance, when His anger was let lose. For this reason Allah commanded this noble <b>Ummah</b> (followers of Muhammad) to always have among them those who command the good and forbid the evil. <br /> <br />This is as Allah says, <br /> <br />وَلْتَكُن مِّنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br />Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. And it is they who are the successful. (3&#59;104) <br /> <br />It is related in a <b>Hadith</b> that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ النَّاسَ إِذَا رَأَوُا الْمُنْكَرَ فَلَمْ يُغَيِّرُوهُ أَوْشَكَ أَنْ يَعُمَّهُمُ اللَّهُ بِعِقَاب <br /> <br />Verily, whenever a group of people see an evil and they do not change it, it is likely that Allah will cover them with (His) punishment. <br /> <br />Thus, Allah says, <br /> <br />فَلَوْلَا كَانَ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ أُوْلُواْ بَقِيَّةٍ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْفَسَادِ فِي الَارْضِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً مِّمَّنْ أَنجَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br />If only there had been among the generations before you persons having wisdom, prohibiting (others) from the <b>Fasad</b> in the earth, - except a few of those whom We saved from among them! <br /> <br />Concerning the statement, <br /> <br />وَاتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مَا أُتْرِفُواْ فِيهِ <br /> <br />Those who did wrong pursued the enjoyment of good things of (this worldly) life, <br /> <br />This means that they continued in their ways of disobedience and evils and they did not heed the protesting of those righteous people, until the torment suddenly seized them. <br /> <br />وَكَانُواْ مُجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and were criminals. <br /> <br />Then, Allah <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ لِيُهْلِكَ الْقُرَى بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا مُصْلِحُونَ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Hud Verse 115" href="/en/11-hud/verse-115/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">116</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>116</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Hud Verse 117" href="/en/11-hud/verse-117/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=11,sura_dir="hud",count_ayat=123,number_aya=116;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
