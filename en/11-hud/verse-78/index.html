Here are my daughters (the women of the nation), they are purer for you...&#34; <br /> <br />This was his attempt to direct them to their women, for verily the Prophet is like a father for his nation. Therefore, he tries to guide them to that which is better for them in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />This is similar to his statement to them in other verse, <br /> <br />أَتَأْتُونَ الذُّكْرَانَ مِنَ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />وَتَذَرُونَ مَا خَلَقَ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَجِكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ عَادُونَ <br /> <br />Go you in unto the males of the nation, and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives Nay, you are a trespassing people! (26&#59;165-166) <br /> <br />Allah said in another verse, <br /> <br />قَالُواْ أَوَلَمْ نَنْهَكَ عَنِ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />They (the people of the city) said&#59;&#34;Did we not forbid you from entertaining any of the <b>`Alamin</b>!&#34; (15&#59;70) <br /> <br />This means, &#34;Didn't we forbid you from hosting men (male) guests!&#34; <br /> <br />قَالَ هَـوُلاءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ <br /> <br />لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ <br /> <br />(Lut) said&#59;&#34;These (the girls of the nation) are my daughters, if you must act (so).&#34; Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly. (15&#59;71-72) <br /> <br />Then, Allah said, in this noble verse, <br />هَـوُلاء بَنَاتِي هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ <br />(Here are my daughters, they are purer for you). <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Actually, they were not his daughters, but they were from among his nation. Every Prophet is like a father to his nation.&#34; <br /> <br />A similar statement has been reported from Qatadah and others. <br /> <br />Concerning the statement, <br /> <br />فَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ وَلَا تُخْزُونِ فِي ضَيْفِي <br /> <br />So have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah and disgrace me not with regard to my guests! <br /> <br />This means, &#34;Accept what I command you by limiting the fulfillment of your desires to your women.&#34; <br /> <br />أَلَيْسَ مِنكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Is there not among you a single right-minded man! <br /> <br />This means, &#34;Is there not a good man among you who will accept what I am enjoining upon you and abandon what I have forbidden for you!</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 77" href="/en/11-hud/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>78</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 79" href="/en/11-hud/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
