This is because I have conveyed the Message of Allah to you, which He has sent me with.&#34; <br /> <br />وَيَسْتَخْلِفُ رَبِّي قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ <br /> <br />My Lord will make another people succeed you, <br /> <br />This refers to a group of people who will worship Allah alone, without associating anything with Him. <br /> <br />This also implies that the polytheists do not bother Allah and they do not harm Him in the least with their disbelief. To the contrary, their disbelief merely harms their own selves. <br /> <br />وَلَا تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />and you will not harm Him in the least. <br /> <br />إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفِيظٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things. <br /> <br />This means that Allah is a Witness and Guardian over the statements of His servants and their actions. He will give them due recompense for their actions. If they do good deeds, He will reward them with good. If they do evil, He will punish them with evil. <br /><b>The Destruction of the People of `Ad and the Salvation of Those among Them Who believed</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 56" href="/en/11-hud/verse-56/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> هود<span class="num-ar">11</span> :<span class="num-ar">57</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Hud<span> 11</span>:<span>57</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Hud Verse 58" href="/en/11-hud/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=11,sura_dir="hud",count_ayat=123,number_aya=57;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
