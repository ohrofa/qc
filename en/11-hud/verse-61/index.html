You are settled in it and you treasure it.' <br /> <br />فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ <br /> <br />then ask forgiveness, <br /> <br />`This is in reference to your previous sins.' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />and turn to Him in repentance. <br /> <br />`This is in reference to the future.' <br /> <br />إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His knowledge), Responsive. <br /> <br />This is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ <br /> <br />And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed Near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.
