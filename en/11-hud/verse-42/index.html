Yet, this ship continued to move upon the water, sailing by the permission of Allah. It moved under His shade, His help, His protection and His blessing. <br /> <br />This is as Allah, the Exalted, said, <br /> <br />إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَأءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ <br /> <br />لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَأ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ <br /> <br />Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship. That We might make it an admonition for you and it might be retained by the retaining ears. (69&#59;11-12) <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />وَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَى ذَاتِ أَلْوَحٍ وَدُسُرٍ <br /> <br />تَجْرِى بِأَعْيُنِنَا جَزَاءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَـهَا ءايَةً فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ <br /> <br />And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails, floating under Our Eyes&#59;a reward for him who had been rejected! And indeed, We have left this as a sign. Then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)! (54&#59;13-15) <br /><b>The Story of the drowning of Nuh's Disbelieving Son</b> <br /> <br />Allah continues the story, saying, <br /> <br />وَنَادَى نُوحٌ ابْنَهُ <br /> <br />and Nuh called out to his son, <br /> <br />This was the fourth son of Nuh. His name was Yam and he was a disbeliever. His father, Nuh, called him at the time of boarding the ship, that he might believe and embark with them. If he did so, he would be saved from drowning like the other disbelievers. <br /> <br />وَكَانَ فِي مَعْزِلٍ <br /> <br />يَا بُنَيَّ ارْكَب مَّعَنَا وَلَا تَكُن مَّعَ الْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />who had separated himself (apart)&#59;&#34;O my son!
