When one hears them speak, he will listen to their eloquent words, even though hypocrites are truly weak and feeble, full of fear, fright and cowardice. <br /> <br />كَأَنَّهُمْ خُشُبٌ مُّسَنَّدَةٌ <br /> <br />They are as blocks of wood propped up. <br /> <br />means, they are shapes that do not have much substance. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />They think that every cry is against them. <br /> <br />means, every time an incident occurs or something frightening happens, they think that it is headed their way. This is indicative of their cowardice, just as Allah said about them, <br /> <br />أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ فَإِذَا جَأءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِى يُغْشَى عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ أَشِحَّةً عَلَى الْخَيْرِ أوْلَـيِكَ لَمْ يُوْمِنُواْ فَأَحْبَطَ اللَّهُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيراً <br /> <br />Being miserly towards you then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah. (33&#59;19) <br /> <br />and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />هُمُ الْعَدُوُّ فَاحْذَرْهُمْ <br /> <br />قَاتَلَهُمُ اللَّهُ أَنَّى يُوْفَكُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path? <br /> <br />means, how they are being led astray to the misguidance, away from the guidance. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ لِلْمُنَافِقِينَ عَلَمَاتٍ يُعْرَفُونَ بِهَا تَحِيَّتُهُمْ لَعْنَةٌ وَطَعَامُهُمْ نُهْبَةٌ وَغَنِيمَتُهُمْ غُلُولٌ لَا يَقْرَبُونَ الْمَسَاجِدَ إِلاَّ هَجْرًا وَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَةَ إِلاَّ دَبْرًا مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ لَا يَأْلَفُونَ وَلَا يُوْلَفُونَ خُشُبٌ بِاللَّيْلِ صُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ وفِي رِوَايَةٍ سُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَار <br /> <br />Hypocrites have certain signs that they are known by. <br /> <br />- Their greeting is really a curse, <br /> <br />- their food is from stealing and the war booty they collect is from theft. <br /> <br />- They shun the Masjid and they do not come to the prayer but at its end. <br /> <br />- They are arrogant; <br /> <br />- it is neither easy for them to blend in, nor it is easy for people to blend with them. <br /> <br />They are like pieces of wood by night and are noisy by day.</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Munafiqun Verse 3" href="/en/63-al-munafiqun/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المنافقون<span class="num-ar">63</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Munafiqun<span> 63</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Munafiqun Verse 5" href="/en/63-al-munafiqun/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=63,sura_dir="al-munafiqun",count_ayat=11,number_aya=4;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
