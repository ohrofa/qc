Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul -- as Ibn Shihab narrated to me -- would stand up every Friday, without objection from anyone because he was a chief of his people, when the Prophet would sit on the <b>Minbar</b>, just before he delivered the <b>Jumu`ah Khutbah</b> to the people. Abdullah bin Ubay would say, <br /> <br />`O people! This is the Messenger of Allah with you. Allah has honored us by sending him and gave you might through him. Support him, honor him and listen to and obey him.' <br /> <br />He would then sit down. So after the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, even after he did what he did, that is, returning to Al-Madinah with a third of the army, he stood up to say the same words. But the Muslims held on to his clothes and said to him, <br /> <br />`Sit down, O enemy of Allah! You are not worthy to stand after you did what you did.' <br /> <br />Abdullah went out of the Masjid crossing people's lines and saying, <br /> <br />`By Allah, it is as if I said something awful when I wanted to support him.' <br /> <br />Some men from Al-Ansar met him at the gate of the Masjid and asked him what happened. He said, <br /> <br />`I just stood up to support him and some men, his Companions, jumped at me, pulled me back and admonished me, as if what I said was an awful thing; I merely wanted to support him.' <br /> <br />They said to him, `Woe to you! Go back so that Allah's Messenger asks Allah to forgive you.' <br /> <br />He said, `By Allah, I do not wish that he ask Allah to forgive me.&#34;' <br /> <br />Qatadah and As-Suddi said, &#34;This Ayah was revealed about Abdullah bin Ubay. <br /> <br />A young relative of his went to Allah's Messenger and conveyed to him an awful statement that Abdullah said. <br /> <br />The Messenger called Abdullah, who swore by Allah that he did not say anything. <br /> <br />The Ansar went to that boy and admonished him. However, Allah sent down what you hear about Abdullah's case and Allah's enemy was told, <br /> <br />`Go to Allah's Messenger,' but he turned his head away, saying that he will not do it.&#34; <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Muhammad bin Yahya bin Hibban, Abdullah bin Abi Bakr and Asim bin Umar bin Qatadah narrated to him the story of Bani Al-Mustaliq. <br /> <br />They said that while the Messenger of Allah was in that area, Jahjah bin Sa`id Al-Ghifari, a hired hand for Umar, and Sinan bin Wabr fought over the water source. <br /> <br />Sinan called out, &#34;O Ansar&#34;, <br /> <br />while Al-Jahjah called, &#34;O Muhajirin!&#34; <br /> <br />Zayd bin Arqam and several Ansar men were sitting with Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul at that time. When Abdullah heard what happened, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;They are bothering us in our land. By Allah, the parable of us and these foolish Quraysh men, is the parable that goes, `Feed your dog until it becomes strong, and it will eat you.' By Allah, when we go back to Al-Madinah, the most mighty will expel the weak from it.&#34; <br /> <br />He then addressed his people who were sitting with him, saying to them, <br /> <br />&#34;What have you done to yourselves You let them settle in your land and shared your wealth with them. By Allah, if you abandon them, they will have to move to another area other than yours.&#34; <br /> <br />Zayd bin Arqam heard these words and conveyed them to Allah's Messenger. Zayd was a young boy then. Umar bin Al-Khattab was with the Messenger and he said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! Order Abbad bin Bishr to cut off his head at his neck.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet replied, <br /> <br />فَكَيْفَ إِذَا تَحَدَّثَ النَّاسُ يَا عُمَرُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَهُ لَا وَلَكِنْ نَادِ يَا عُمَرُ الرَّحِيل <br /> <br />What if people started saying that Muhammad kills his companions, O Umar, No. However, order the people to start the journey (back to Al-Madinah). <br /> <br />When Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul was told that his statement reached Allah's Prophet, he went to him and denied saying it. He swore by Allah that he did not utter the statement that Zayd bin Arqam conveyed. Abdullah bin Ubay was a chief of his people and they said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! May be the young boy merely guessed and did not hear what was said correctly.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger started the journey at an unusual hour of the day and was met by Usayd bin Al-Hudayr, who greeted him acknowledging his Prophethood. Usayd said, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah! You are about to begin the journey at an unusual time.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />أَمَا بَلَغَكَ مَا قَالَ صَاحِبُكَ ابْنُ أُبَيَ زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ إِذَا قَدِمَ الْمَدِينَةَ سَيُخْرِجُ الاَْعَزُّ مِنْهَا الاَْذَل <br /> <br />Did not the statement of your friend, Ibn Ubay reach you He claimed that when he returns to Al-Madinah, the mighty one will expel the weak one out of it. <br /> <br />Usayd said, &#34;Indeed, you are the mighty one, O Allah's Messenger, and he is the disgraced one.&#34; <br /> <br />Usayd said, <br /> <br />&#34;Take it easy with him, O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, when Allah brought you to us, we were about to gather the pearls (of a crown) so that we appoint him king over us. He thinks that you have rid him of his kingship.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah traveled with the people until the night fell, then the rest of the night until the beginning of the next day and then set camp with the people. He wanted to busy them from talking about what had happened. The minute people felt the ground under their feet, they went to sleep and Surah <b>Al-Munafiqin</b> was revealed. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were in a battle with Allah's Messenger and a man from the Emigrants kicked an Ansari man. The Ansari man called out, <br /> <br />`O Ansar!' and the Emigrant called out, `O Emigrants!' <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger heard that and said, <br /> <br />مَا بَالُ دَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ دَعُوهَا فَإِنَّهَا مُنْتِنَة <br /> <br />What is this call of Jahiliyyah? Abandon it because it is offensive. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Ubay heard that and said, <br /> <br />`Have they (the Emigrants) done so By Allah, if we return to Al-Madinah, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.' <br /> <br />The Ansar at that time, were more numerous that the Emigrants when the Messenger of Allah came to Al-Madinah, but later on the Emigrants increased in number. When this statement reached the Prophet, Umar got up and said, <br /> <br />`O Allah's Messenger! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite!' <br /> <br />The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />دَعْهُ لَا يَتَحَدَّثُ النَّاسُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَه <br /> <br /> <br />Leave him, lest the people say that Muhammad kills his companions.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Ikrimah and Ibn Zayd and others said that <br /> <br />when the Prophet and his Companions went back to Al-Madinah, Abdullah, the son of Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, remained by the gate of Al-Madinah holding his sword. People passed by him as they returned to Al-Madinah, and then his father came. Abdullah, son of Abdullah, said to his father, <br /> <br />&#34;Stay where you are,&#34; <br /> <br />and his father asked what the matter was His son said, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah! You will enter through here until the Messenger of Allah allows you to do so, for he is the honorable one and you are the disgraced.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah came by, and he used to be in the last lines, Abdullah bin Ubay complained to him about his son and his son said, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah, O Allah's Messenger! He will not enter it until you say so.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger gave his permission to Abdullah bin Ubay and his son said, <br /> <br />&#34;Enter, now that the Messenger of Allah gave you his permission.&#34; <br /> <br />In his Musnad, Abu Bakr Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr Al-Humaydi recorded from Abu Harun Al-Madani that <br /> <br />Abdullah, the son of `Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, said to his father, <br /> <br />&#34;You will never enter Al-Madinah unless and until you say, `Allah's Messenger is the honorable one and I am the disgraced.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Prophet came, Abdullah, son of Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul said to him, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! I was told that you have decided to have my father executed. By He Who has sent you with Truth, I never looked straight to his face out of respect for him. But if you wish, I will bring you his head, because I would hate to see the killer of my father.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Munafiqun Verse 7" href="/en/63-al-munafiqun/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المنافقون<span class="num-ar">63</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Munafiqun<span> 63</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Munafiqun Verse 9" href="/en/63-al-munafiqun/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=63,sura_dir="al-munafiqun",count_ayat=11,number_aya=8;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
