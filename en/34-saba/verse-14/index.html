Then it became apparent that he had died a long time before. <br /> <br />It also became clear to Jinn and men alike that the Jinn do not know the Unseen as they (the Jinn) used to imagine and tried to deceive people. <br /> <br />This is what Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />مَا دَلَّهُمْ عَلَى مَوْتِهِ إِلاَّ دَابَّةُ الاْاَرْضِ تَأْكُلُ مِنسَأَتَهُ فَلَمَّا خَرَّ تَبَيَّنَتِ الْجِنُّ أَن لَّوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ الْغَيْبَ مَا لَبِثُوا فِي الْعَذَابِ الْمُهِينِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick.
