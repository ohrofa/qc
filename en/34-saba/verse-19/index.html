Surely in that, which is mentioned, there are signs, lessons, for every [servant who is] steadfast, [in refraining] from acts of disobedience, grateful, for [God's] graces.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَقَالُوا رَبَّنَا بَاعِدْ بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا وَظَلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ <br /> <br />But they said&#59;&#34;Our Lord! Make the stages between our journey longer,&#34; and they wronged themselves; <br /> <br />They failed to appreciate this blessing, as Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and others said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;They wanted to travel long distances through empty wilderness where they would need to carry provisions with them and would have to travel through intense heat in a state of fear.&#34; <br /> <br />فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ وَمَزَّقْنَاهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ <br /> <br />so We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all totally. <br /> <br />means, `We made them something for people to talk about when they converse in the evening, how Allah plotted against them and dispersed them after they had been together living a life of luxury, and they were scattered here and there throughout the land.' <br /> <br />So, the Arabs say of a people when they are dispersed, <br /> <br />&#34;They have been scattered like <b>Saba'</b>,&#34; in all directions. <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, in this are indeed signs for every steadfast, grateful. <br /> <br />In the punishment which these people suffered, the way in which their blessings and good health were turned into vengeance for their disbelief and sins, is a lesson and an indication for every person who is steadfast in the face of adversity and grateful for blessings. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />عَجِبْتُ مِنْ قَضَاءِ اللهِ تَعَالَى لِلْمُوْمِنِ إِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ حَمِدَ رَبَّهُ وَشَكَرَ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ مُصِيبَةٌ حَمِدَ رَبَّهُ وَصَبَرَ يُوْجَرُ الْمُوْمِنُ فِي كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتْى فِي اللُّقْمَةِ يَرْفَعُهَا إِلَى فِي امْرَأَتِه <br /> <br />I am amazed at what Allah has decreed for the believer; if something good befalls him, He praises his Lord and gives thanks, and if something bad befalls him, he praises his Lord and has patience. The believer will be rewarded for everything, even the morsel of food which he lifts to his wife's mouth.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. <br /> <br />There is a corroborating report in the Two Sahihs, where a Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, says&#59; <br /> <br />عَجَبًا لِلْمُوْمِنِ لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ تَعَالَى لَهُ قَضَاءً إِلاَّ كَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ وَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لاَِحَدٍ إِلاَّ لِلْمُوْمِن <br /> <br />How amazing is the affair of the believer! Allah does not decree anything for him but it is good for him. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks, and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This is not for anyone except the believer.&#34; <br /> <br />It was reported that Qatadah said&#59;<b> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ <br /></b> (Verily, in this are indeed signs for every steadfast, grateful). It was Mutarrif who used to say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;How blessed is the grateful, patient servant. If he is given something, he gives thanks, and if he is tested, he bears it with patience.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Saba&#39; Verse 18" href="/en/34-saba/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> سبإ<span class="num-ar">34</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Saba'<span> 34</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Saba&#39; Verse 20" href="/en/34-saba/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=34,sura_dir="saba",count_ayat=54,number_aya=19;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
