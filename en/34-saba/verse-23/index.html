(2&#59;255) <br /> <br />وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لَا تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْياً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَأءُ وَيَرْضَى <br /> <br />And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with. (53&#59;26) <br /> <br />وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى وَهُمْ مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ <br /> <br />and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him. (21&#59;28) <br /> <br />It was reported in the Two Sahihs through more than one chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah, who is the leader of the sons of Adam and the greatest intercessor before Allah, will go to stand in <b>Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud</b>(the praised position) to intercede for all of mankind when their Lord comes to pass judgement upon them. <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />فَأَسْجُدُ للهِ تَعَالَى فَيَدَعُنِي مَااَشاءَ اللهُ أَنْ يَدَعَنِي وَيَفْتَحُ عَلَيَّ بِمَحَامِدَ لَاأ أُحْصِيهَا الاْأنَ ثُمَّ يُقَالُ يَامُحَمَّدُ ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ وَقُلْ تُسْمَعْ وَسَلْ تُعْطَهُ وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّع <br /> <br />Then I will prostrate to Allah, may He be exalted, and He will leave me (in that position), as long as Allah wills, and He will inspire me to speak words of praise which I cannot mention now. Then it will be said, &#34;O Muhammad, raise your head. <br /> <br />- Speak, you will be heard; <br /> <br />- ask, you will be given; <br /> <br />- intercede, your intercession will be accepted...&#34; <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوا الْحَقَّ <br /> <br />So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts, they say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;What is it that your Lord has said!&#34; <br /> <br />They say the truth. <br /> <br />This also refers to the great degree of His might and power. When He speaks words of revelation, the inhabitants of the heavens hear what He says, and they tremble with fear (of Allah) so much that they swoon. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Masruq and others. <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ <br /> (So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts) means, <br /> <br />when the fear leaves their hearts. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Abu Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami, Ash-Sha`bi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dhahhak, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said concerning the Ayah, <b> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوا الْحَقَّ <br /></b> (So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts, they say&#59;&#34;What is it that your Lord has said!&#34; They say the truth), <br /> <br />&#34;When the fear is lifted from their hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />When this happens, some of them say to others, &#34;What did your Lord say!&#34; <br /> <br />Those (angels) who are carrying the Throne tell those who are next to them, then they in turn pass it on to those who are next to them, and so on, until the news reaches the inhabitants of the lowest heaven. Allah says, <b> <br />قَالُوا الْحَقَّ <br /></b> (They say the truth) meaning, <br /> <br />they report what He said, without adding or taking away anything. <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And He is the Most High, the Most Great. <br /> <br />In his <b>Tafsir</b> of this <b>Ayah</b> in his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ تَعَالَى الاَْمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَيِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ كَأَنَّهُ سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُوا لِلَّذِي قَالَ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُ السَّمْعِ وَمُسْتَرِقُ السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَوَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ فَحَرَّفَهَا وَنَشَرَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الاْخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ حَتْى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِايَةَ كَذْبَةٍ فَيُقَالُ أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا كَذَا وَكَذَا فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء <br /> <br />When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His Words, making a sound like a chain striking a smooth rock. When the fear is banished from their hearts, they say, &#34;What is it that your Lord has said!&#34; <br /> <br />They say the truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. <br /> <br />Then the one who is listening out hears that, and those who are listening out are standing one above the other. -- <br /> <br />Sufyan (one of the narrators) demonstrated with his hand, holding it vertically with the fingers outspread. <br /> <br />So he hears what is said and passes it on to the one below him, and that one passes it to the one who is below him, and so on until it reaches the lips of the soothsayer or fortune-teller. <br /> <br />Maybe a meteor will hit him before he can pass anything on, or maybe he will pass it on before he is hit. He tells a hundred lies alongside it, but it will be said, &#34;Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen?&#34; <br /> <br />So they believe him because of the one thing which was heard from heaven.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, not by Muslim. Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Saba&#39; Verse 22" href="/en/34-saba/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> سبإ<span class="num-ar">34</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Saba'<span> 34</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Saba&#39; Verse 24" href="/en/34-saba/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
