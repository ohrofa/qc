(Like) this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants. And there the disbelievers lost utterly. (40&#59;84-85) <br /> <br />إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا فِي شَكٍّ مُّرِيبٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, they have been in grave doubt. <br /> <br />means, in this world they had doubts, so their faith will not be accepted from them when they behold the punishment with their own eyes. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />Beware of doubt. For whoever dies doubting, will be raised doubting and whoever dies believing, with certainty will be raised believing with certainty. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Saba'</b>. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Guide to the right way</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Saba&#39; Verse 53" href="/en/34-saba/verse-53/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> سبإ<span class="num-ar">34</span> :<span class="num-ar">54</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Saba'<span> 34</span>:<span>54</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
