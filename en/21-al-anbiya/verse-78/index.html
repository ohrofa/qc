Dawud (David) ruled that the owner of the grapes should keep the sheep. <br /> <br />Suleiman (Solomon) said, `Not like this, O Prophet of Allah!' <br /> <br />(Dawud) said, `How then' <br /> <br />(Suleiman) said&#59;`Give the grapes to the owner of the sheep and let him tend them until they grow back as they were, and give the sheep to the owner of the grapes and let him benefit from them until the grapes have grown back as they were. Then the grapes should be given back to their owner, and the sheep should be given back to their owner.' <br /> <br />This is what Allah said&#59; <br />فَفَهَّمْنَاهَا سُلَيْمَانَ <br /> (And We made Suleiman to understand (the case).&#34; <br /> <br />This was also reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَاهِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and We were witness to their judgement.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anbiya&#39; Verse 77" href="/en/21-al-anbiya/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنبياء<span class="num-ar">21</span> :<span class="num-ar">78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anbiya<span> 21</span>:<span>78</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Anbiya&#39; Verse 79" href="/en/21-al-anbiya/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
