(46&#59;27) <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This means the victory of Islam over disbelief.&#34; <br /> <br />The meaning is&#59;Do they not learn a lesson from the fact that Allah supported those (believers) against their enemies, He destroyed the disbelieving nations and the evil-doing townships, and He saved His believing servants. <br /> <br />So Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَفَهُمُ الْغَالِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Is it then they who will overcome! <br /> <br />meaning, on the contrary, they are the ones who will be overcome, who will be defeated, humiliated and brought low.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anbiya&#39; Verse 43" href="/en/21-al-anbiya/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنبياء<span class="num-ar">21</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anbiya<span> 21</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Anbiya&#39; Verse 45" href="/en/21-al-anbiya/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=21,sura_dir="al-anbiya",count_ayat=112,number_aya=44;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
