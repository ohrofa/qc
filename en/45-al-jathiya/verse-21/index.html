(mahyhum wa- mamtuhum, [this clause] constitutes the subject and a supplement; the sentence [itself] is a substitution for the kf [of ka'lladhna, `as those'], and both [suffixed] pronouns [-hum] refer to the disbelievers). The meaning is&#59; do they suppose that in the Hereafter We will assign them [a] good [fate] like believers, [that they will enjoy] a life of plenty, one equal to their life in this world, as when they said to the believers&#59; `Surely if we were to be resurrected, we will be given the same good things that you will be given!' God, exalted be He, says, in accordance with His denial [implicit] in the [rhetorical interrogative] hamza&#59; How evil is that judgement which they make! In other words, it will not be so, for in the Hereafter they will be [suffering] in the chastisement, in contrast to their lives in this world; the believers, on the other hand, will be [delighting] in the Reward in the Hereafter because of their righteous deeds in this world, such as [their observance of] prayers, [their] alms-giving, fasting and otherwise (the m, `that ... which', relates to the verbal action, that is to say, ba'isa hukman hukmuhum hdh, `awful as a judgement is this judgement of theirs').</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Life and the Death of the Believers and the Disbelievers are not Equal</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted states here that the believers and the disbelievers are never equal. Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />لَا يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَأيِزُونَ <br /> <br />Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.
