Therefore, honor and respect him, be polite with him and obey his orders. For he is more knowledgeable about what benefits you and is more concerned with you than you yourselves are. His opinions in such matters are more complete than your own.' <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Blessed said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />النَّبِىُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves, (33&#59;6). <br /> <br />Then He clarifies that they fall short in overseeing their own benefit; <br /> <br />لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِّنَ الاَْمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ <br /> <br />If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would surely be in trouble. <br /> <br />`if he obeys all of your opinions and desires, you will earn trouble and hardship.' <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَلَوِ اتَّبَعَ الْحَقُّ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ بَلْ أَتَيْنَـهُمْ بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَن ذِكْرِهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ <br /> <br />And if the truth had been in accordance with their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted! <br /> <br />Nay, We have brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their reminder. (23&#59;71) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَكِنَّ اللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ الاِْيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ <br /> <br />But Allah has endeared the faith to you and has beautified it in your hearts, <br /> <br />`made faith dear to your souls and beautified it in your hearts.' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ <br /> <br />and has made disbelief, <b>Fusuq</b> and <b>`Isyan</b> hateful to you. <br /> <br />`He has made disbelief, sins, whether major or minor, and <b>`Isyan</b> -- all types of sins, hateful to you.' <br /> <br />This statement transfers us from one level to a better level, to perfect Allah's bounty. <br /> <br />Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الرَّاشِدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Such are they who are the rightly guided. <br /> <br />those who have these qualities are the rightly guided ones whom Allah has granted guidance and correctness. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi said that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, when the idolators retreated, the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />اسْتَوُوا حَتْى أُثْنِيَ عَلَى رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />Stay in straight lines so that I praise my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />They stood behind him in lines and he said, <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ كُلُّهُ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ لَا قَابِضَ لِمَا بَسَطْتَ وَلَا بَاسِطَ لِمَا قَبَضْتَ وَلَا هَادِيَ لِمَنْ أَضْلَلْتَ وَلَا مُضِلَّ لِمَنْ هَدَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ وَلَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُقَرِّبَ لِمَا بَاعَدْتَ وَلَا مُبَاعِدَ لِمَا قَرَّبْتَ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ ابْسُطْ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ بَرَكَاتِكَ وَرَحْمَتِكَ وَفَضْلِكَ وَرِزْقِكَ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ النَّعِيمَ الْمُقِيمَ الَّذِي لَا يَحُولُ وَلَا يَزُولُ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ النَّعِيمَ يَوْمَ الْعَيْلَةِ وَالاَْمْنَ يَوْمَ الْخَوْفِ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي عَايِذٌ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا أَعْطَيْتَنَا وَمِنْ شَرِّ مَا مَنَعْتَنَا <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ حَبِّبْ إِلَيْنَا الاْيمَانَ وَزَيِّنْهُ فِي قُلُوبِنَا وَكَرِّهْ إِلَيْنَا الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ وَاجْعَلْنَا مِنَ الرَّاشِدِينَ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ تَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ وَأَحْيِنَا مُسْلِمِينَ وَأَلْحِقْنَا بِالصَّالِحِينَ غَيْرَ خَزَايَا وَلَا مَفْتُونِينَ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ قَاتِلِ الْكَفَرَةَ الَّذِينَ يُكَذِّبُونَ رُسُلَكَ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِكَ وَاجْعَلْ عَلَيْهِمْ رِجْزَكَ وَعَذَابَكَ <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ قَاتِلِ الْكَفَرَةَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلهَ الْحَق <br /> <br />O Allah! Your is the praise. <br /> <br />O Allah! There is none who can withhold what You send, or send what You withhold, or guide whom You send astray, or misguide whomever You guide, or give what You deprive, or deprive whom You give, or draw closer whom You cast or cast whom You draw closer. <br /> <br />O Allah! Bestow on us from Your blessings, mercy, grace and provisions. <br /> <br />O Allah! I ask You for the eternal delight that never ends or fades away. <br /> <br />O Allah! I ask You for provisions on the Day of deprivation and safety on the Day of fear. <br /> <br />O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the evil repercussions of what You have given us and from the evil of what You have deprived us of. <br /> <br />O Allah! Make faith dear to us and beatify it in our hearts and make disbelief, <b>Fusuq</b> and <b>`Isyan</b> hateful to us, and make us among the rightly guided. <br /> <br />O Allah! Allow us to die as Muslims, live as Muslims and join us with the ranks of the righteous ones, without tasting humiliation or turmoil. <br /> <br />O Allah! Fight the disbelievers who deny Your Messengers and hinder others from Your path; send on them Your torment and punishment. <br /> <br />O Allah! Fight the disbelievers who were given the Scriptures, the True God.&#34; <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hujurat Verse 6" href="/en/49-al-hujurat/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحجرات<span class="num-ar">49</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hujurat<span> 49</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hujurat Verse 8" href="/en/49-al-hujurat/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=49,sura_dir="al-hujurat",count_ayat=18,number_aya=7;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
