Indeed some suspicions are sins, that is to say, it causes one to fall into sin. This [suspicion] may have many forms, such as thinking ill of the good folk from among the believers -- and such [good folk] are many -- in contrast to the immoral individuals among them in whose case there is no sin, so long as it [the suspicion] is in accordance with their outward behaviour. And do not spy (tajassas&#59; one of the two t' letters [of tatajassas] has been omitted)&#59; do not pursue the imperfections and faults of Muslims by searching them out; nor backbite one another, do not speak of him by [mentioning] something which he is averse to [having mentioned of himself], even if it be true. Would any of you love to eat the flesh of his brother dead? (read maytan or mayyitan). That is to say, it would not be right for him [to do so]. You would abhor it. Thus to backbite him in life would be like eating his flesh when he is dead. This latter [form of behaviour] has been suggested to you and you were averse to it, so be averse to the former too. And fear God, that is, His punishment for backbiting, by repenting of it; assuredly God is Relenting, accepting of the penitence of those who repent, Merciful, to them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Prohibition of Unfounded Suspicion</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted forbids His faithful servants from being suspicious, which includes having doubts and suspicions about the conduct of one's family, relatives and other people in general. Therefore, Muslims are to avoid suspicion without foundation. <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicion is sin. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted forbids His faithful servants from being suspicious, which includes having doubts and suspicions about the conduct of one's family, relatives and other people in general. Therefore, Muslims are to avoid suspicion without foundation. <br /> <br />The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br /> <br />&#34;Never think ill of the word that comes out of your believing brother's mouth, as long as you can find a good excuse for it.&#34; <br /> <br />Malik recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظَّنَّ فَإِنَّ الظَّنَّ أَكْذَبُ الْحَدِيثِ <br /> <br />وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَحَسَّسُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَنَافَسُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَحَاسَدُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَبَاغَضُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَدَابَرُوا <br /> <br />وَكُونُوا عِبَادَ اللهِ إِخْوَانًا <br /> <br />Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales; <br /> <br />do not spy on one another; <br /> <br />do not look for other's faults; <br /> <br />do not be jealous of one another; <br /> <br />do not envy one another; <br /> <br />do not hate one another; and <br /> <br />do not desert (shun) one another. <br /> <br />And O Allah's servants! Be brothers! <br /> <br />The Two Sahihs and Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith. <br /> <br />Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَقَاطَعُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَدَابَرُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَبَاغَضُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَحَاسَدُوا <br /> <br />وَكُونُوا عِبَادَ اللهِ إِخْوَانًا <br /> <br />وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِمُسْلِمٍ أَنْ يَهْجُرَ أَخَاهُ فَوْقَ ثَلَثَةِ أَيَّام <br /> <br />Do not shun each other; <br /> <br />do not ignore one another; <br /> <br />do not hate one another, and <br /> <br />do not envy one another, <br /> <br />and be brothers, O servants of Allah. <br /> <br />No Muslim is allowed to shun his brother for more than three days. <br /> <br />Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith, who considered it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا <br /> <br />And spy not, (on each other). <br /><b>Tajassus</b>, usually harbors ill intentions, and the spy is called a <b>Jasus</b>. <br /> <br />As for <b>Tahassus</b> (inquiring) it is usually done for a good reason. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said that Prophet Ya`qub said, <br /> <br />يبَنِىَّ اذْهَبُواْ فَتَحَسَّسُواْ مِن يُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ وَلَا تَايْـَسُواْ مِن رَّوْحِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />&#34;O my sons! Go you and inquire (<b>Tahassasu</b>) about Yusuf and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's mercy.&#34; (12&#59;87) <br /> <br />Both of these terms, <b>`Tajassus</b>' and <b>`Tahassus</b>' could have evil connotations. <br /> <br />In the <b>Sahih</b> it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَجَسَّسُوا وَلَاا تَحَسَّسُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَبَاغَضُوا <br /> <br />وَلَا تَدَابَرُوا <br /> <br />وَكُونُوا عِبَادَ اللهِ إِخْوَانًا <br /> <br />Neither commit <b>Tajassus</b> nor <b>Tahassus</b>, <br /> <br />nor hate each other <br /> <br />nor commit <b>Tadabur</b>. <br /> <br />And be brothers, O servants of Allah. <br /> <br />Al-Awza`i said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Tajassus</b> means, to search for something, while <br /><b>Tahassus</b> means, listening to people when they are talking without their permission, or eavesdropping at their doors. <br /><b>Tadabur</b> refers to shunning each other.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said about backbiting; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضًا <br /> <br />neither backbite one another, <br /> <br />thus prohibiting it, which was explained in a Hadith collected by Abu Dawud that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What is backbiting?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />ذِكْرُكَ أَخَاكَ بِمَا يَكْرَه <br /> <br />Mentioning about your brother in a manner that he dislikes. <br /> <br />He was asked, `What if my brother was as I mentioned?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />إِنْ كَانَ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدِ اغْتَبْتَهُ وَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدْ بَهَتَّه <br /> <br />If he was as you mentioned, you will have committed backbiting. But if he was not as you say about him, you will have falsely accused him.&#34; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Backbiting was sternly warned against, and this is why Allah the Exalted and Most Blessed compared it to eating the flesh of a dead human being, <br /> <br />أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ <br /> <br />Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother You would hate it. <br /> <br />Just as you hate eating the flesh of a dead person, on account of your nature; so hate backbiting, on account of your religion. The latter carries a punishment that is worse than the former. This Ayah seeks to discourage people from backbiting and warns against it. <br /> <br />The Prophet used these words to discourage taking back a gift that one gives to someone, <br /> <br />كَالْكَلْبِ يَقِيءُ ثُمَّ يَرْجِعُ فِي قَيْيِه <br /> <br />He is just like the dog that eats its vomit. <br /> <br />after saying, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ لَنَا مَثَلُ السَّوْء <br /> <br />Ours is not an evil parable. <br /> <br />Using various chains of narration, the Sahihs and Musnads record that the Prophet said during the Farewell Hajj&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ دِمَاءَكُمْ وَأَمْوَالَكُمْ وَأَعْرَاضَكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ حَرَامٌ كَحُرْمَةِ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِي شَهْرِكُمْ هذَا فِي بَلَدِكُمْ هذَا <br /> <br />Verily, your blood, wealth and honor are as sacred among you as the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُّ الْمُسْلِمِ عَلَى الْمُسْلِمِ حَرَامٌ مَالُهُ وَعِرْضُهُ وَدَمُهُ حَسْبُ امْرِىءٍ مِنَ الشَّرِّ أَنْ يَحْقِرَ أَخَاهُ الْمُسْلِم <br /> <br />All of the Muslim is sacred to the Muslim, his wealth, honor and his blood. It is evil enough for someone to belittle his Muslim brother. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that a cousin of Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ma`iz came to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Allah's Messenger! I have committed adultery,' and the Messenger turned away from him until Ma`iz repeated his statement four times. The fifth time, the Prophet asked him, <br /> <br />زَنَيْتَ <br /> <br />Have you committed adultery? <br /> <br />Ma`iz said, Yes. <br /> <br />The Prophet asked, <br /> <br />وَتَدْرِي مَا الزِّنَا <br /> <br />Do you know what adultery means? <br /> <br />Ma`iz said, `Yes. I have illegally done with her what a husband legally does with his wife.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا تُرِيدُ إِلَى هذَا الْقَوْلِ <br /> <br />What do you seek to accomplish by this statement? <br /> <br />Ma`iz said, `I intend that you purify me.' <br /> <br />The Prophet asked, <br /> <br />أَدْخَلْتَ ذلِكَ مِنْكَ فِي ذلِكَ مِنْهَا كَمَا يَغِيبُ الْمِيلُ فِي الْمُكْحُلَةِ وَالرِّشَا فِي الْبِيْرِ <br /> <br />Have you gone into her just as the stick goes into the <b>kohl</b> container and the rope goes into the well? <br /> <br />Ma`iz said, `Yes, O Allah's Messenger!' <br /> <br />The Prophet commanded that Ma`iz be stoned to death and his order was carried out. <br /> <br />The Prophet heard two men saying to one another, `Have you not seen the man who had Allah cover his secret, but his heart could not let him rest until he was stoned to death, just as the dog is stoned.' <br /> <br />The Prophet continued on and when he passed by the corpse of a donkey, he asked, <br /> <br />أَيْنَ فُلَنٌ وَفُلَنٌ انْزِلَا فَكُلَ مِنْ جِيفَةِ هذَا الْحِمَار <br /> <br />Where are so-and-so? Dismount and eat from this donkey. <br /> <br />They said, `May Allah forgive you, O Allah's Messenger! Would anyone eat this meat?' <br /> <br />The Prophet said; <br /> <br />فَمَا نِلْتُمَا مِنْ أَخِيكُمَا انِفًا أَشَدُّ أَكْلً مِنْهُ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ إِنَّهُ الاْنَ لَفِي أَنْهَارِ الْجَنَّةِ يَنْغَمِسُ فِيهَا <br /> <br /> <br />The backbiting you committed against your brother is worse as a meal than this meal. By He in Whose Hand is my soul! He is now swimming in the rivers of Paradise.&#34; <br /> <br />This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, &#34;We were with the Messenger of Allah when a rotten odor was carried by the wind. The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَتَدْرُونَ مَا هذِهِ الرِّيحُ هَذِهِ رِيحُ الَّذِينَ يَغْتَابُونَ النَّاس <br /> <br /> <br />Do you know what this odor is? It is the odor of those who backbite people.&#34; <br /><b>Accepted Repentance from Backbiting and Slander</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُوا اللَّه <br /> <br />And have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, <br /> <br />that is, regarding what He has commanded you and forbidden for you. Fear Him and beware of Him, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />He forgives those who repent to Him, is merciful with those who go back to Him and trust in Him. <br /> <br />The majority of scholars have stated that repentance for committing the sin of backbiting is that one refrains from backbiting intending not to repeat it again. There is a difference of opinion if whether feeling remorse is required in this case, and also if one should apologize to those who he has backbitten. <br /> <br />Some scholars stated that it is not necessary for one to ask those whom he has backbitten to forgive him, because if they knew what was said about them, they could be hurt more than if they were not told about it. It is better, they said, that one should praise those whom he has backbitten in audiences in which he has committed the act. It is also better if one defends the injured party against any further backbiting, as much as one can, as recompense for his earlier backbiting</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hujurat Verse 11" href="/en/49-al-hujurat/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحجرات<span class="num-ar">49</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hujurat<span> 49</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hujurat Verse 13" href="/en/49-al-hujurat/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
