Their bellies were very fat, and did not have much understanding. They said some words I could not hear, then one of them said, <br /> <br />`Do you think that Allah can hear what we are saying now?' <br /> <br />The other said, `If we raise our voices, He will hear it, but if we do not raise our voices, He will not hear it.' <br /> <br />The other said, `If He can hear one thing from us, He can hear everything.' <br /> <br />I mentioned this to the Prophet , then Allah revealed the words&#59; <br />وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَنْ يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلَا أَبْصَارُكُمْ وَلَا جُلُودُكُمْ <br /> (And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you) until; <br />مِّنْ الْخَاسِرِينَ <br /> (of those utterly lost!). <br /> <br />This is how it was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. <br /> <br />A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), <br /> <br />Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain). <br /> <br />فَإِن يَصْبِرُوا فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ <br /> <br />وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُوا فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 22" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> فصلت<span class="num-ar">41</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Fussilat<span> 41</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem Sajda, Al-Masabeeh, Al-Aquat</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 24" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
