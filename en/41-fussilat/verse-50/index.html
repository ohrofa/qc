Even if (it should come, and) I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find with Him the best (because I judge myself to always be deserving of what is the best).&#34; Without doubt We will make those who disbelieve understand all that they do (and call them to account), and without doubt We will make them taste a harsh punishment.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Yet if We show him mercy from Ourselves after he has suffered affliction, he will surely say, `This is my due. I do not believe that the (promised) Hour will (ever) come (to be established). And if I am (at all) brought back to my Lord, I shall of course, have with Him the very best (of all the goodly things).

But if I am brought back to my Lord, Surely, there will be for me the best (wealth, etc.) with Him. Then, We verily, will show to the disbelievers what they have done and We shall make them taste a severe torment.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3>Talal Itani</h3><p>And when We let him taste a mercy from Us, after the adversity that had afflicted him, he will say, “This is mine, and I do not think that the Hour is coming; and even if I am returned to my Lord, I will have the very best with Him.” We will inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and We will make them taste an awful punishment.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3>English Literal</h3><p>And if (E) We made him taste/experience mercy from Us, from after calamity/disastrous distress touched him, he will say (E): &#34;That (is) for me, and I do not think/assume the Hour/Resurrection (is) starting , and if (E) I was returned to my Lord, that truly for me at Him (is) the best/most beautiful/goodness (E).&#34; So We will inform those who disbelieved with what they made/did , and We will make them taste/experience (E) from a strong/rough torture.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3>Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>And if We bestow Our Mercy upon him after hardship, he will surely say: “This is what I truly deserve, and I do not believe that the Hour (of Resurrection) will ever come to pass; and if I am returned to my Lord, there too I shall enjoy the best.” Surely We shall fully apprise the unbelievers of what they have done, and We shall certainly make them taste a severe chastisement.</p></div><div id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><h3>Maulana Mohammad Ali</h3><p>Man tires not of praying for good, but, if evil touch him, he is despairing, hopeless.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3>Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#34;This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established.

I do not think that the Hour will ever set in, and even if (wa-la-in&#59; the lm is for oaths) I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best [reward] with Him', namely, Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement (the lm [prefixed] in both verbs is that for oaths).</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَلَيِنْ أَذَقْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّاء مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَذَا لِي <br /> <br />And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say&#59;&#34;This is due to my (merit)...&#34; <br /> <br />means, if something good happens to him or some provision comes to him after a period of difficulty, he says, `this is because of me, because I deserve this from my Lord.' <br /> <br />وَمَا أَظُنُّ السَّاعَةَ قَايِمَةً <br /> <br />I think not that the Hour will be established. <br /> <br />means, he does not believe that the Hour will come. So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />كَلَّ إِنَّ الاِنسَـنَ لَيَطْغَى <br /> <br />أَن رَّءَاهُ اسْتَغْنَى <br /> <br />Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient. (96&#59;6-7) <br /> <br />وَلَيِن رُّجِعْتُ إِلَى رَبِّي إِنَّ لِي عِندَهُ لَلْحُسْنَى <br /> <br />But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. <br /> <br />means, `if there is a Hereafter after all, then my Lord will be generous and kind to me just as He was in this world.' So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَنُنَبِّيَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment. <br /> <br />Thus Allah threatens punishment and vengeance to those whose conduct and belief is like that</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 49" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> فصلت<span class="num-ar">41</span> :<span class="num-ar">50</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Fussilat<span> 41</span>:<span>50</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem Sajda, Al-Masabeeh, Al-Aquat</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 51" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-51/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
