(79&#59;44) <br /> <br />لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَأ إِلااَّ هُوَ <br /> <br />None can reveal its time but He. (7&#59;187) <br /> <br />وَمَا تَخْرُجُ مِن ثَمَرَاتٍ مِّنْ أَكْمَامِهَا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنثَى وَلَا تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ <br /> <br />No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor brings forth (young), except by His knowledge. <br /> <br />means, all of that is known to Him, and nothing is hidden from your Lord the weight of a speck of dust on the earth or in the heaven. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا <br /> <br />not a leaf falls, but He knows it. (6&#59;59) <br /> <br />يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ <br /> <br />Allah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion. (13&#59;8) <br /> <br />وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلَا يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ <br /> <br />And no aged man is granted a length of life nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah. (35&#59;11) <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَايِي <br /> <br />And on the Day when He will call unto them (saying)&#59;&#34;Where are My (so-called) partners?&#34; <br /> <br />means, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will call out to the idolators before all of creation and say, &#34;Where are My partners whom you worshipped besides Me?&#34; <br /> <br />قَالُوا اذَنَّاكَ <br /> <br />They will say&#59;&#34;We inform You...&#34; <br /> <br />means, `we tell You,' <br /> <br />مَا مِنَّا مِن شَهِيدٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that none of us bears witness to it. <br /> <br />means, `not one of us will bear witness today that You have any partner.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 46" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-46/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> فصلت<span class="num-ar">41</span> :<span class="num-ar">47</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Fussilat<span> 41</span>:<span>47</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ha Meem Sajda, Al-Masabeeh, Al-Aquat</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Fussilat Verse 48" href="/en/41-fussilat/verse-48/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=41,sura_dir="fussilat",count_ayat=54,number_aya=47;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
