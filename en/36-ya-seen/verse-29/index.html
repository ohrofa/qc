You are only telling lies.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messengers said&#59;&#34;Our Lord knows that we have been sent as Messengers to you, And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).&#34; <br /> <br />If they had been from among the Disciples, they would have said something to indicate that they had come from the Messiah, peace be upon him. And Allah knows best. Moreover, if they had been messengers sent by the Messiah, why would the people have said to them, <br />إِن <br /> <br />أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَ <br /> (&#34;You are only human beings like ourselves&#34;) <br /> <br />- The second is that the people of Antioch did believe in the messengers sent by the Messiah to them. Antioch was the first city to believe in the Messiah, and it is one of the four cities in which there are Christian patriarchs. These cities are&#59; <br /> <br />Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Messiah; <br /> <br />Antioch, because it was the first city where all of the people believed in the Messiah; <br /> <br />Alexandria, because it was in that city that they agreed to reform the hierarchy of patriarchs, metropolitans (archbishops), bishops, priests, deacons and monks; and <br /> <br />Rome, because it is the city of the Emperor Constantine who supported and helped to establish their religion. <br /> <br />When he adopted Constantinople as his city, the Patriarch of Rome moved there, as has been mentioned by several historian, such as Sa`id bin Batriq and others, both People of the Book and Muslims. <br /> <br />If we accept that, then the people of Antioch were the first to believe, but Allah tells us that the people of this town rejected His Messengers and that He destroyed them with one <b>Sayhah</b> and lo! they (all) were still. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />- The third is that the story of Antioch and the Disciples of the Messiah happened after the <b>Tawrah</b> had been revealed. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, and others among the <b>Salaf</b> stated that after revealing the <b>Tawrah</b>, Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, did not destroy an entire nation by sending a punishment upon them. Rather, He commanded the believers to fight the idolators. They mentioned this when discussing the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;<b> <br />وَلَقَدْ اتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَابَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ الاُْولَى <br /></b> (And indeed We gave Musa -- after We had destroyed the generations of old -- the Scripture) (28&#59;43). This implies that the city mentioned in the Qur'an is a city other than Antioch, as also stated by more than one of the <b>Salaf</b>. Or, if we wish to keep the same name, it is possible that it is another Antioch, not the one which is well-known, for it is not known that it (the famous Antioch) was destroyed, either during Christian times or before. And Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ya Seen Verse 28" href="/en/36-ya-seen/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يس<span class="num-ar">36</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ya Sin<span> 36</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Yaseen</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ya Seen Verse 30" href="/en/36-ya-seen/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
