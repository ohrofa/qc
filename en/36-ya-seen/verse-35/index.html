So that they may eat of the fruit thereof -- <br /> <br />means, `We have created therein rivers which flow to the places where they are needed, so that they may eat of their fruits.' <br /> <br />When Allah reminds them of the blessing that He bestows upon His creation by creating crops and plants, He mentions the different types and kinds of fruits. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ <br /> <br />and their hands made it not. <br /> <br />means, all of that could only come about by the mercy of Allah towards them, not by their own efforts and labor and strength. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Abbas and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَفَلَ يَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Will they not then give thanks! <br /> <br />meaning, will they not then give thanks for the innumerable blessings that He has bestowed upon them. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir, however, understood the word <b>Ma</b> to mean <b>Alladhi</b> (i.e., a relative pronoun). In this case the meaning of the <b>Ayah</b> would be that they eat from the fruits provided by Allah's bounty and from what their own hands have done, i.e., by planting the seeds and tending the plants. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir mentioned other possible interpretations in his <b>Tafsir</b>, but this is the interpretation that he favored. This interpretation also fits with the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud&#59;<b> <br />لِيَأْكُلُوا مِن ثَمَرِهِ وَمِمَّا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَفَلَ يَشْكُرُونَ <br /> </b> (So that they may eat of the fruit thereof -- and from what their own hands have done). <br /> <br />Then Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ya Seen Verse 34" href="/en/36-ya-seen/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يس<span class="num-ar">36</span> :<span class="num-ar">35</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ya Sin<span> 36</span>:<span>35</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Yaseen</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ya Seen Verse 36" href="/en/36-ya-seen/verse-36/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=36,sura_dir="ya-seen",count_ayat=83,number_aya=35;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
