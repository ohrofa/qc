This, that is, [this] raising, is that which the Compassionate One had promised and, regarding which, the messengers had spoken the truth'&#59; they affirm [this truth] when such affirmation is no longer of any benefit to them -- but it is also said that this is said to them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>قَالُوا يَا وَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا <br /> <br />They will say&#59;&#34;Woe to us!

When they see with their own eyes that in which they had disbelieved, <br />قَالُوا يَا وَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا <br /> (They will say&#59;&#34;Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep&#34;). <br /> <br />This does not contradict the fact that they will be punished in their graves, because in comparison to what is to come afterwards, that will seem like a nap. <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;They will sleep before the Resurrection.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;That will be between the two trumpet blasts, they will say, `Who has raised us up from our place of sleep&#34;' <br /> <br />When they say that, the believers will respond. <br /> <br />This was the view of more than one of the <b>Salaf</b>. <br /> <br />هَذَا مَا وَعَدَ الرَّحْمَنُ وَصَدَقَ الْمُرْسَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />(It will be said to them)&#59;&#34;This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the Messengers spoke truth!&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said, <br /> <br />&#34;The angels will reply to them in this manner.&#34; <br /> <br />There is no contradiction because both are possible.
