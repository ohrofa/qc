This means `they are jealous of you due to their hatred of you, and were it not for Allah's protection of you, defending you against them (then their evil eye would harm you).' <br /><b>The Effect of the Evil Eye is Real</b> <br /> <br />In this Ayah is a proof that the effect of the evil eye and its affliction by the command of Allah is real. Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. <br /> <br />The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Abu `Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا رُقْيَةَ إِلاَّ مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة <br /> <br />There is no <b>Ruqyah</b> except to cure the evil eye and the sting. <br /> <br />This is how Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. <br /> <br />Imam Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih on the authority of Buraydah himself, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet. There is a story concerning this incident (as reported by Buraydah in Sahih Muslim), and At-Tirmidhi recorded the Hadith in this manner (like Muslim's version). <br /> <br />This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of `Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet. <br /> <br />Imran's wording is, <br /> <br />لَاا رُقْيَةَ إِلاَّ مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة <br /> <br />There is no <b>Ruqyah</b> except to cure the evil eye and the sting.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ وَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ سَابَقَ الْقَدَرَ سَبَقَتِ الْعَيْنُ وَإِذَا اسْتُغْسِلْتُمْ فَاغْسِلُوا <br /> <br />The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree (and change it, then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform <b>Ghusl</b> (to remove the evil eye) then wash well. <br /> <br />Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. <br /> <br />It is reported from Ibn Abbas that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (his grandsons) by saying, <br /> <br />أُعِيذُكُمَا بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّة <br /> <br />I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil. <br /> <br />Then he would say&#59; <br /> <br />هَكَذَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يُعَوِّذُ إِسْحَاقَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلَم <br /> <br />Thus, did Ibrahim used to seek protection for Ishaq and Ismail (his sons).&#34; <br /> <br />This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers. <br /><b>The Hadith of Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf that `Amir bin Rabi`ah passed by Sahl bin Hunayf while he was bathing and he said, <br /> <br />&#34;I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today (i.e., commenting on how nice Sahl's skin was).&#34; <br /> <br />So he did not leave before he (Sahl) fell down on the ground. So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him (the Prophet) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet then said, <br /> <br />مَنْ تَتَّهِمُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br />Who do you blame (or hold responsible) for this? <br /> <br />The people replied, &#34;&#34;Amir bin Rabi`ah.&#34; <br /> <br />Then the Prophet said, <br /> <br />عَلَمَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيَدْعُ لَهُ بِالْبَرَكَة <br /> <br />Would one of you knowingly kill his brother? If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him. <br /> <br />Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform <b>Wudu</b>' with the water. <br /> <br />So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his <b>Izar</b>. <br /> <br />Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. <br /> <br />Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.&#34; <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, <br /> <br />&#34;And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.&#34; <br /><b>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans. Then when the <b>Mu`awwidhatan</b> were revealed, he used them (for seeking protection) and abandoned everything else. <br /> <br />This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan</b>.&#34; <br /><b>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, &#34;O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment?&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br />نَعَم <br /> (Yes).&#34; <br /> <br />Then Jibril said, <br /> <br />بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُوْذِيكَ وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك <br /> <br />&#34;In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (<b>Ruqyah</b>), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.&#34; <br /> <br />This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said, <br /> <br />بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُوْذِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ اللهُ يَشْفِيك <br /> <br />In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (<b>Ruqyah</b>), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you. <br /><b>The Hadith of Asma' bint `Umays</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubayd bin Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi that Asma' said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Bani Ja`far are afflicted with the evil eye; should I seek to have <b>Ruqyah</b> &#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet replied, <br /> <br />نَعَمْ فَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ يَسْبِقُ الْقَدَرَ لَسَبَقَتْهُ الْعَيْن <br /> <br />Yes, for if anything could overcome the divine decree, it would be the evil eye. <br /> <br />This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /><b>The Hadith of `A'ishah</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah ordered her to have <b>Ruqyah</b> performed as a cure against the evil eye. <br /> <br />This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <br /> <br />The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, <br /> <br />&#34;I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet then said, <br /> <br />هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ <br /> <br />Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him)? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.&#34; <br /> <br />So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said, <br /> <br />عَلَمَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ هَلَّ إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ <br /> <br />Would one of you knowingly kill his brother? Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like? Then the Prophet said, <br /> <br />اغْتَسِلْ لَه <br /> <br />Bathe for him. <br /> <br />So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his <b>Izar</b> (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.&#34; <br /><b>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, <br /> <br />&#34;`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said, <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا <br /> <br />O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain. <br /> <br />He (Sahl) then stood up, and Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ أَوْ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ أَوْ مِنْ مَالِهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيُبَرِّكْ فَإِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَق <br /> <br />If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real. <br /><b>The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</b> <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they say&#59;&#34;Verily, he is a madman!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, &#34;Verily, he is a madman.&#34; They say this because he came with the Qur'an. <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qalam Verse 50" href="/en/68-al-qalam/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القلم<span class="num-ar">68</span> :<span class="num-ar">51</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qalam<span> 68</span>:<span>51</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qalam Verse 52" href="/en/68-al-qalam/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
