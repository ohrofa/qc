What prevented you when you saw them going astray. That you followed me not (according to my advice to you)! Have you then disobeyed my order!&#34; <br /> <br />He (Harun) said&#59;&#34;O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard, nor by my head! Verily, I feared lest you should say&#59;`You have caused a division among the Children of Israel, and you have not respected (waited or observed) my word!&#34;' (20&#59;92-94) <br /> <br />Here, Allah said that; <br /> <br />قَالَ ابْنَ أُمَّ إِنَّ الْقَوْمَ اسْتَضْعَفُونِي وَكَادُواْ يَقْتُلُونَنِي <br /> <br />فَلَ تُشْمِتْ بِيَ الاعْدَاء وَلَا تَجْعَلْنِي مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He (Harun) said&#59;&#34;O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me among the people who are wrongdoers.&#34; <br /> <br />Harun said, `Do not place me on the same level as they are, as if I was one of them.' <br /> <br />Further, Harun said, `O son of my mother', so that Musa would feel more mercy and leniency towards him, even though Harun was also the son of Musa's father. When Musa was satisfied that his brother was innocent, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ قَالَ لَهُمْ هَـرُونُ مِن قَبْلُ يقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا فُتِنتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ الرَّحْمَـنُ فَاتَّبِعُونِى وَأَطِيعُواْ أَمْرِى <br /> <br />And Harun indeed had said to them beforehand&#59;&#34;O my people! You are being tried in this, and verily, your Lord is (Allah) the Most Gracious, so follow me and obey my order.&#34; (20&#59;90) <br /> <br />this is when, <br /> <br />قَالَ رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَلَاخِي وَأَدْخِلْنَا فِي رَحْمَتِكَ <br /> <br />وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-A&#39;raf Verse 149" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-149/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">150</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>150</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-A&#39;raf Verse 151" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-151/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=150;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
