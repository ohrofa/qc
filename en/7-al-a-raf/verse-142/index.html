In it, was their law and the details of their legislation. <br /> <br />وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلَثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَاتُ رَبِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً <br /> <br />And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added ten, and he completed the term, appointed by his Lord, of forty nights. <br /> <br />Allah stated here that He appointed thirty nights for Musa. The scholars of Tafsir said that Musa fasted this period, and when they ended, Musa cleaned his teeth with a twig. Allah commanded him to complete the term adding ten more days, making the total forty. When the appointed term finished, Musa was about to return to Mount Tur, as Allah said, <br /> <br />يبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ قَدْ أَنجَيْنَـكُمْ مِّنْ عَدُوِّكُمْ وَوَاعَدْنَـكُمْ جَانِبَ الطُّورِ الاٌّيْمَنَ <br /> <br />O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount.
