Has not the compact of the Book been taken touching them, that they should say concerning God nothing but the truth? And they have studied what is in it; and the Last Abode is better for those who are godfearing.

Was a pledge not taken from them, writ-ten in the Scripture, to say nothing but the truth about God? And they have studied its contents well. For those who are mindful of God, the Hereafter is better. ‘Why do you not use your reason?’</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Then there succeeded them a posterity; they inherited the Book taking this near world's gear and saying surety it will be forgiven, And if there cometh unto them anot her gear like thereunto they shall take it.

Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter.

And when there comes to them an opportunity for acquiring more of those goods, they seize it. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth?

Was not the covenant of the Book taken with them that they shall not attribute anything to Allah except the truth?

Was there not taken from them the promise concerning the Book that they should say of God nothing but the truth? and they (are people who) have studied and taught what is therein.

Were they not bound to the covenant mentioned in the Scripture that they would not say of Allâh anything but the truth? And they have read for themselves what it (- the Scripture) contains.

They would have even doubled such gains if they could have received more. Did they not make a covenant (with God) in the Book not to speak any thing other than the Truth about God and to study its contents well? The life hereafter is much better for the pious ones.

But the Home of the Hereafter is better for the cautious; will you not understand?</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture, the Torah, from their forefathers, choosing the transient things of this inferior [life], that is, the ephemeral aspects of this lowly thing that the world is, in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful, and saying, `It will be forgiven us', what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them, they would take them (wa-in ya'tihim `aradun mithluhu ya'khudhhu&#59; this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in it&#59; and in the Torah there is no [such] promise about forgiveness for persistence [in sin]. Has not the covenant of the Scripture (mthqu l-kitbi, the annexation functions in place of f, `in' [sc. `the covenant in the Scripture']) been taken (a-lam yu'khadh, `has [it] not been taken', is an interrogative meant as an affirmative) from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have studied (wa-daras, is a supplement to yu'khadh, `has it [not] been taken?'), they have read, what is in it, so why do they impute lies to it [the Scripture] by ascribing to it [the idea of] forgiveness for persistence [in sin]? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary, of what is unlawful. Do they not understand? (ya`qiln, may also be read as ta`qiln, `[do] you [not] understand?') that it is better and so prefer it to [the abode of] this world?</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ وَرِثُواْ الْكِتَابَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> <br />Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life, <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, after the generation made up of righteous and unrighteous people, another generation came that did not have goodness in them, and they inherited the <b>Tawrah</b> and studied it. <br /> <br />Mujahid commented on Allah's statement, <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> (They chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life), <br /> <br />&#34;They will consume anything they can consume in this life, whether legally or illegally. Yet, they wish for forgiveness, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> <br />Saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven for us.&#34; And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> (they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life), <br /> <br />&#34;This, by Allah, is an evil generation, <br />وَرِثُواْ الْكِتَابَ <br /> (which inherited the Book) after their Prophets and Messengers, for they were entrusted with this job by Allah's command to them. Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُواْ الصَّلَـوةَ <br /> <br />Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who neglect the <b>Salah</b> (the prayers). (19&#59;59) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <b> <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا <br /></b> (They chose the goods of this low life saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven to us&#34;). They wish and hope from Allah, while deceiving themselves, <br />وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> (And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them). Nothing stops them from this behavior, for whenever they are given an opportunity in this life, they will consume regardless of it being allowed or not.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said about Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ <br />.. <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br /> <br />Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, until..... And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />&#34;Every time the Children of Israel appointed a judge, he used to take bribes. The best ones among them held a counsel and took covenants from each that they would not take bribes. However, when one of them would take bribes in return for judgment and was asked, `What is the matter with you; you take a bribe to grant judgment', he replied, `I will be forgiven.' So the rest of his people would admonish him for what he did. But when he died, or was replaced, the one who replaced him would take bribes too. Therefore, Allah says, if the others (who admonished him) would have a chance to loot this world, they will take it.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /> <br />Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth, <br /> <br />thus, admonishing them for this behavior. Allah took a pledge from them that they would declare the truth to people and not hide it. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَاشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلً فَبِيْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ <br /> <br />(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it, but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And indeed worst is that which they bought. (3&#59;187) <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn Abbas said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /></b> (Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth), <br /> <br />&#34;Their claim that Allah will forgive the sins they keep committing without repenting from them.&#34; <br /> <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br />And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالدَّارُ الاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And the home in the Hereafter is better for those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Encouraging them to seek Allah's tremendous reward and warning them against His severe torment. <br /> <br />Allah says here, `My reward and what I have are better for those who avoid prohibitions, abandon lusts and become active in the obedience of their Lord.' <br /> <br />أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Allah says' Do not these people, who preferred this life instead of what is with Me, have any sense to prohibit them from their foolish and extravagant ways!' <br /> <br />Allah then praises those who adhere to His Book, which directs them to follow His Messenger Muhammad</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 168" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-168/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">169</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>169</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 170" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-170/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
