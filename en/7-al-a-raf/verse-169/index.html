Yet, they wish for forgiveness, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> <br />Saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven for us.&#34; And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> (they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life), <br /> <br />&#34;This, by Allah, is an evil generation, <br />وَرِثُواْ الْكِتَابَ <br /> (which inherited the Book) after their Prophets and Messengers, for they were entrusted with this job by Allah's command to them. Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُواْ الصَّلَـوةَ <br /> <br />Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who neglect the <b>Salah</b> (the prayers). (19&#59;59) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <b> <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا <br /></b> (They chose the goods of this low life saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven to us&#34;). They wish and hope from Allah, while deceiving themselves, <br />وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> (And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them). Nothing stops them from this behavior, for whenever they are given an opportunity in this life, they will consume regardless of it being allowed or not.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said about Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ <br />.. <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br /> <br />Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, until..... And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />&#34;Every time the Children of Israel appointed a judge, he used to take bribes. The best ones among them held a counsel and took covenants from each that they would not take bribes. However, when one of them would take bribes in return for judgment and was asked, `What is the matter with you; you take a bribe to grant judgment', he replied, `I will be forgiven.' So the rest of his people would admonish him for what he did. But when he died, or was replaced, the one who replaced him would take bribes too. Therefore, Allah says, if the others (who admonished him) would have a chance to loot this world, they will take it.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /> <br />Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth, <br /> <br />thus, admonishing them for this behavior. Allah took a pledge from them that they would declare the truth to people and not hide it. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَاشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلً فَبِيْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ <br /> <br />(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it, but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And indeed worst is that which they bought. (3&#59;187) <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn Abbas said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /></b> (Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth), <br /> <br />&#34;Their claim that Allah will forgive the sins they keep committing without repenting from them.&#34; <br /> <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br />And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالدَّارُ الاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And the home in the Hereafter is better for those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Encouraging them to seek Allah's tremendous reward and warning them against His severe torment. <br /> <br />Allah says here, `My reward and what I have are better for those who avoid prohibitions, abandon lusts and become active in the obedience of their Lord.' <br /> <br />أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Allah says' Do not these people, who preferred this life instead of what is with Me, have any sense to prohibit them from their foolish and extravagant ways!' <br /> <br />Allah then praises those who adhere to His Book, which directs them to follow His Messenger Muhammad</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 168" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-168/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">169</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>169</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 170" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-170/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=169;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
