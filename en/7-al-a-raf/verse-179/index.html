He wrote all this in a Book, kept with Him, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالاَْرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء <br /> <br />Verily, Allah decided the destination and due measurement of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth, and His Throne was over the water. <br /> <br />There are many <b>Hadiths</b> on this subject, and certainly, the matter of <b>Al-Qadar</b> is of utmost importance, yet this is not where we should discuss it. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ اذَانٌ لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا <br /> <br />They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not. <br /> <br />meaning, they do not benefit from these senses that Allah made for them as a means of gaining guidance. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعاً وَأَبْصَـراً وَأَفْيِدَةً فَمَأ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلَا أَبْصَـرُهُمْ وَلَا أَفْيِدَتُهُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ إِذْ كَانُواْ يَجْحَدُونَ بِـَايَـتِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing, seeing, and hearts; but their hearing, seeing, and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the <b>Ayat</b>. (46&#59;26) <br /> <br />Allah also said about the hypocrites, <br /> <br />صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ <br /> <br />(They are) deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the right path). (2&#59;18), <br /> <br />and about the disbelievers, <br /> <br />صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br />(They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand. (2&#59;171) <br /> <br />However, they are not deaf, dumb or blind, except relation to the guidance. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لَاسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ <br /> <br />Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth). (8&#59;23) <br /> <br />فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ <br /> <br />Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind. (22&#59;46) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ <br /> <br />And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah), We appoint for him Shaytan to be an intimate companion to him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! (43&#59;36-37) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ كَالَانْعَامِ <br /> <br />They are like cattle, <br /> <br />means, those who neither hear the truth, nor understand it, nor see the guidance, are just like grazing cattle that do not benefit from these senses, except for what sustains their life in this world. <br /> <br />Allah said in a similar <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَأءً وَنِدَاءً <br /> <br />And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of one who shouts to those who hear nothing but calls and cries. (2&#59;171) <br /> <br />meaning, their example, when they are called to the faith, is the example of cattle that hear only the voice of their shepherd, but cannot understand what he is saying. <br /> <br />Allah further described them <br /> <br />بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ <br /> <br />nay even more astray, <br /> <br />than cattle, because cattle still respond to the call of their shepherd, even though they do not understand what he is saying. <br /> <br />As for the people described here, they are unlike cattle, which fulfill the purpose and service they were created for. The disbeliever was created to worship Allah alone in Tawhid, but he disbelieved in Allah and associated others in His worship. Therefore, those people who obey Allah are more honorable than some angels, while cattle are better than those who disbelieve in Him. So Allah said; <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ كَالَانْعَامِ <br /> <br />بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 178" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-178/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">179</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>179</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 180" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-180/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
