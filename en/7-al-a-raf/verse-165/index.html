This type did not do what would warrant praise, nor commit wrong so that they are admonished. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ibn Abbas said about the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;`I do not know whether or not the people were saved who said; <br />لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْمًا اللّهُ مُهْلِكُهُمْ <br /> (&#34;Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy...&#34;). So I continued discussing it with him until I convinced him that they were. Then he gave me (the gift of) a garment.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَخَذْنَا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ <br /> <br />بِعَذَابٍ بَيِيسٍ <br /> <br />and We seized those who did wrong with a <b>Ba'is</b> torment, <br /> <br />indicating that those who remained were saved. <br /> <br />As for `<b>Ba'is</b>', it means `severe', according to Mujahid, or `painful', according to Qatadah. These meanings are synonymous, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />because they used to rebel against Allah's command. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا عَتَوْاْ عَن مَّا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ قُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُواْ قِرَدَةً خَاسِيِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 164" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-164/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">165</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>165</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 166" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-166/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
