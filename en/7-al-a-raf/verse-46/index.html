God, exalted be He, says&#59; They, that is, those men of the Heights, have not entered it, Paradise, although they aspire, to enter it. Al-Hasan [al-Basr] said, `God causes them to have this aspiration only because He desires to be generous to them'.

Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment. (57&#59;13) <br /> <br />It is also about <b>Al-A`raf</b> that Allah said, <br /> <br />وَعَلَى الَاعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ <br /> <br />and on <b>Al-A`raf</b>will be men.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that As-Suddi said about Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ <br /></b> (And between them will be a screen), <br /> <br />&#34;It is the wall, it is <b>Al-A`raf</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-A`raf</b> is a barrier between Paradise and the Fire, a wall that has a gate.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-A`raf</b> is plural for <b>Urf</b>, where every elevated piece of land is known as <b>Urf</b> to the Arabs.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-A`raf</b> is so named because its residents recognize (<b>Ya`rifun</b>) the people. <b>Al-A`raf's</b> residents are those whose good and bad deeds are equal, as Hudhayfah, Ibn Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and several of the <b>Salaf</b> and later generations said.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Hudhayfah was asked about the people of <b>Al-A`raf</b>and he said, <br /> <br />&#34;A people whose good and bad deeds are equal. Their evil deeds prevented them from qualifying to enter Paradise, and their good deeds qualified them to avoid the Fire. Therefore, they are stopped there on the wall until Allah judges them.&#34; <br /> <br />يَعْرِفُونَ كُلًّ بِسِيمَاهُمْ <br /> <br />who would recognize all, by their marks. <br /> <br />وَنَادَوْاْ أَصْحَابَ الْجَنَّةِ أَن سَلَمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And they will call out to the dwellers of Paradise, &#34;Peace be on you!&#34; and at that time they will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but they will hope to enter (it). <br /> <br />Ma`mar said that Al-Hasan recited this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ <br /> (and at that time they will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but they will hope to enter (it), Then he said, <br /> <br />&#34;By Allah! Allah did not put this hope in their hearts, except for an honor that He intends to bestow on them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said; <br /> <br />&#34;Those who hope are those among you whom Allah informed of their places.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَارُهُمْ تِلْقَاء أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 45" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">46</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>46</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 47" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=46;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
