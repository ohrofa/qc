She had beautiful daughters and she was wealthy, and Dhu'ab bin `Amr, one of the leaders of <b>Thamud</b>, was her husband. <br /> <br />There was another noblewoman whose name was Saduf bint Al-Muhayya bin Dahr bin Al-Muhayya, who was of noble family, wealthy and beautiful. She was married to a Muslim man from <b>Thamud</b>, but she left him. <br /> <br />These two women offered a prize for those who swore to them that they would kill the camel. <br /> <br />Once, Saduf summoned a man called Al-Habbab and offered herself to him if he would kill the camel, but he refused. So she called a cousin of hers whose name was Musaddi bin Mihraj bin Al-Muhayya, and he agreed. <br /> <br />As for Unayzah bint Ghanm, she called Qudar bin Salif bin Jundu, a short person with red-blue skin, a bastard, according to them. Qudar was not the son of his claimed father, Salif, but the son of another man called, Suhyad. However, he was born on Salif's bed (and thus named after him). <br /> <br />Unayzah said to Qudar, &#34;I will give you any of my daughters you wish, if you kill the camel.&#34; <br /> <br />Qudar bin Salif and Musaddi bin Mihraj went along and recruited several mischievous persons from <b>Thamud</b> to kill the camel. Seven more from <b>Thamud</b> agreed, and the group became nine, as Allah described, when He said, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ يُفْسِدُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ <br /> <br />And there were in the city nine men, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform. (27&#59;48) <br /> <br />These nine men were chiefs of their people, and they lured the entire tribe into agreeing to kill the camel. So they waited until the camel left the water well, where Qudar waited beside a rock on its path, while Musaddi waited at another rock. <br /> <br />When the camel passed by Musaddi he shot an arrow at her and the arrow pierced her leg. At that time, Unayzah came out and ordered her daughter, who was among the most beautiful women, to uncover her face for Qudar, encouraging Qudar to swing his sword, hitting the camel on her knee. So she fell to the ground and screamed once to warn her offspring. Qudar stabbed her in her neck and slaughtered her. Her offspring went up a high rock and screamed. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Ma`mar that someone reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basari that the offspring said, <br /> <br />&#34;O my Lord! Where is my mother?&#34; <br /> <br />It was said that her offspring screamed thrice and entered a rock and vanished in it, or, they followed it and killed it together with its mother. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />When they finished the camel off and the news reached Prophet Salih, he came to them while they were gathered. When he saw the camel, he cried and proclaimed, <br />تَمَتَّعُواْ فِي دَارِكُمْ ثَلَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ <br /> (&#34;Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days.&#34; (11&#59;65) <br /><b>The Wicked Ones Plot to Kill Prophet Salih, But the Torment descended on Them</b> <br /> <br />The nine wicked persons killed the camel on a Wednesday, and that night, they conspired to kill Salih. They said, <br /> <br />&#34;If he is truthful, we should finish him before we are finished. If he is a liar, we will make him follow his camel.&#34; <br /> <br />قَالُواْ تَقَاسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ لَنُبَيِّتَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ ثُمَّ لَنَقُولَنَّ لِوَلِيِّهِ مَا شَهِدْنَا مَهْلِكَ أَهْلِهِ وَإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ <br /> <br />وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;Swear one to another by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household, and thereafter we will surely say to his near relatives&#59;`We witnessed not the destruction of his household, and verily, we are telling the truth.&#34;' <br /> <br />So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. (27&#59;49-50) <br /> <br />When they conspired to kill Salih and gathered at night to carry out their plot, Allah, to Whom belongs all might and Who protects His Messengers, rained down stones that smashed the heads of these nine people before the rest of the tribe. <br /> <br />On Thursday, the first of the three days of respite, the people woke up and their faces were pale (yellow), just as Prophet Salih had promised them. <br /> <br />On the second day of respite, Friday, they woke up and found their faces had turned red. <br /> <br />On the third day of the respite, Saturday, they woke up with their faces black. <br /> <br />On Sunday, they wore the fragrance of <b>Hanut</b> (the perfume for enshrouding the dead before burial) and awaited Allah's torment and revenge, we seek refuge with Allah from it. <br /> <br />They did not know what will be done to them or how and from where the torment would come. When the sun rose, the <b>Sayhah</b> (loud cry) came from the sky and a severe tremor overtook them from below; the souls were captured and the bodies became lifeless, all in an hour. <br /> فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ <br /> (And they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes). <br /> <br />They became dead and lifeless and none among them, whether young, old, male or female, escaped the torment. <br /> <br />The scholars of <b>Tafsir</b> said that none from the offspring of <b>Thamud</b> remained, except Prophet Salih and those who believed in him. <br /> <br />A disbelieving man called Abu Righal was in the Sacred Area at the time and the torment that befell his people did not touch him. When he went out of the Sacred Area one day, a stone fell from the sky and killed him. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Isma`il bin Umayyah said that; the Prophet passed by the gravesite of Abu Righal and asked the Companions if they knew whose grave it was. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />هَذَا قَبْرُ أَبِي رِغَالٍ رَجُلٍ مِنْ ثَمُودَ كَانَ فِي حَرَمِ اللهِ فَمَنَعَهُ حَرَمُ اللهِ عَذَابَ اللهِ فَلَمَّا خَرَجَ أَصَابَهُ مَا أَصَابَ قَومهُ فَدُفِنَ هَاهُنَا وَدُفِنَ مَعَهُ غُصْنٌ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ فَنَزَلَ الْقَوْمُ فَابْتَدَرُوهُ بِأَسْيَافِهِمْ فَبَحَثُوا عَنْهُ فَاسْتَخْرَجُوا الْغُصْن <br /> <br />This is the grave of Abu Righal, a man from <b>Thamud</b>. He was in the Sacred Area of Allah and this fact saved him from receiving Allah's torment. When he went out of the Sacred Area, what befell his people also befell him. He was buried here along with a branch made from gold. <br /> <br />So the people used their swords and looked for the golden branch and found it. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Az-Zuhri said that; <br /> <br />Abu Righal is the father of the tribe of Thaqif</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 77" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>78</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 79" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
