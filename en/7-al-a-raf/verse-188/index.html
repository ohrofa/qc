(72&#59;26) <br /> <br />وَلَوْ كُنتُ أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ لَاسْتَكْثَرْتُ مِنَ الْخَيْرِ <br /> <br />If I had the knowledge of the <b>Ghayb</b> (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said that, <br /> <br />refers to money. <br /> <br />In another narration, Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;I would have knowledge of how much profit I would make with what I buy, and I would always sell what I would make profit from, <b> <br />وَمَا مَسَّنِيَ السُّوءُ <br /></b> (&#34;and no evil should have touched me).&#34; and poverty would never touch me.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;And others said, `This means that if I know the Unseen then I would prepare for the years of famine during the prosperous years, and in the time of high cost, I would have prepared for it.&#34;' <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam also commented on this <b>Ayah</b>; <b> <br />وَمَا مَسَّنِيَ السُّوءُ <br /></b> (and no evil should have touched me), <br /> <br />&#34;I would have avoided and saved myself from any type of harm before it comes.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet then stated that; <br /> <br />إِنْ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah tells that the Prophet is a warner and bearer of good news. He warns against the torment and brings good news of Paradise for the believers, <br /> <br />فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ بِلَسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً <br /> <br />So We have made this (the Qur'an) easy on your tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to the pious, and warn with it the most quarrelsome of people.
