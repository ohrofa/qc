Allah created them on this <b>Fitrah</b>, or way, just as He said, <br /> <br />فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />So set you (O Muhammad) your face truly towards the religion, <b>Hanifan</b>. Allah's <b>Fitrah</b> with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in <b>Khalqillah</b>. (30&#59;30) <br /> <br />And it is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> from Abu Hurayrah who said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ وَيُنَصِّرَانِهِ وَيُمَجِّسَانِهِ كَمَا تُولَدُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاء <br /> <br />Every child is born upon the <b>Fitrah</b>, it is only his parents who turn him into a Jew, a Christian or a Zoroastrian. Just as animals are born having full bodies, do you see any of them having a cutoff nose (when they are born). <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Iyad bin Himar said that the Messenger of Allah said; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ اللهُ إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِمْ وَحَرَّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَا أَحْلَلْتُ لَهُم <br /> <br />Allah said, `I created My servants <b>Hunafa</b> (monotheists), but the devils came to them and deviated them from their religion, prohibiting what I allowed. <br /> <br />There are <b>Hadiths</b> that mention that Allah took Adam's offspring from his loins and divided them into those on the right and those on the left. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />يُقَالُ لِلرَّجُلِ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَرَأَيْتَ لَوْ كَانَ لَكَ مَا عَلَى الاَْرْضِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ أَكُنْتَ مُفْتَدِيًا بِهِ <br /> <br /> فَيَقُولُ نَعَمْ <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ قَدْ أَرَدْتُ مِنْكَ أَهْوَنَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ قَدْ أَخَذْتُ عَلَيْكَ فِي ظَهْرِ ادَمَ أَنْ لَا تُشْرِكَ بِي شَيْيًا فَأَبَيْتَ إِلاَّ أَنْ تُشْرِكَ بِي <br /> <br />It will be said to a man from the people of the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, `If you owned all that is on the earth, would you pay it as ransom!' <br /> <br />He will reply, `Yes.' <br /> <br />Allah will say, `I ordered you with what is less than that, when you were still in Adam's loins, that is, associate none with Me (in worship). You insisted that you associate with Me (in worship).' <br /> <br />This was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> Commenting on this <b>Ayah</b> (7&#59;172). <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَمَّا خَلَقَ اللهُ ادَمَ مَسَحَ ظَهْرَهُ فَسَقَطَ مِنْ ظَهْرِهِ كُلُّ نَسَمَةٍ هُوَ خَالِقُهَا مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ عَيْنَي كَلِّ إِنْسَانٍ مِنْهُمْ وَبِيصًا مِنْ نُورٍ ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ادَمَ فَقَالَ أَيْ رَبِّ مَنْ هوُلَاءِ <br /> <br />When Allah created Adam, He wiped Adam's back and every person that He will create from him until the Day of Resurrection fell out from his back. Allah placed a glimmering light between the eyes of each one of them. Allah showed them to Adam and Adam asked, `O Lord! Who are they!' <br /> <br />قَالَ هوُلَااءِ ذُرِّيَّتُكَ <br /> <br />Allah said, `These are your offspring.' <br /> <br />فَرَأَىَ رَجُلً مِنْهُمْ فَأَعْجَبَهُ وَبِيصُ مَا بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ قَالَ أَيْ رَبِّ مَنْ هَذَا <br /> <br />Adam saw a man from among them whose light he liked. He asked, `O Lord! Who is this man!' <br /> <br />قَالَ هَذَا رَجُلٌ مِنْ اخِرِ الاْاُمَمِ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ يُقَالُ لَهُ دَاوُدُ <br /> <br />Allah said, `This is a man from the latter generations of your offspring. His name is Dawud.' <br /> <br />قَالَ رَبِّ وَكَمْ جَعَلْتَ عُمْرَهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Adam said, `O Lord! How many years would he live!' <br /> <br />قَالَ سِتِّينَ سَنَةً <br /> <br />Allah said, `Sixty years.' <br /> <br />قَالَ أَيْ رَبِّ وَقَدْ وَهَبْتُ لَهُ مِنْ عُمْرِي أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً <br /> <br />Adam said, `O Lord! I have forfeited forty years from my life for him.' <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا انْقَضَى عُمْرُ ادَمَ جَاءَهُ مَلَكُ الْمَوْتِ قَالَ أَوَ لَمْ يَبْقَ مِنْ عُمْرِي أَرْبَعُونَ سَنَةً <br /> <br />When Adam's life came to an end, the angel of death came to him (to take his soul). Adam said, `I still have forty years from my life term, don't I!' <br /> <br />قَالَ أَوَ لَمْ تُعْطِهَا ابْنَكَ دَاوُدَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He said, `Have you not given it to your son Dawud!' <br /> <br />قَالَ فَجَحَدَ ادَمُ فَجَحَدَتْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُ وَنَسِيَ ادَمُ فَنِسَيتْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُ وَخَطِىءَ ادَمُ فَخَطِيَتْ ذُرِّيَّتُه <br /> <br />So Adam denied that and his offspring followed suit (denying Allah's covenant), Adam forgot and his offspring forgot, Adam made a mistake and his offspring made mistakes. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan Sahih</b>, and it was reported from various chains of narration through Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hakim also recorded it in his Mustadrak, and said; &#34;<b>Sahih</b> according to the criteria of Muslim, and they did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />These and similar <b>Hadiths</b> testify that Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, brought forth Adam's offspring from his loins and separated between the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُواْ بَلَى <br /> <br />شَهِدْنَا <br /> <br />and made them testify as to themselves (saying)&#59;&#34;Am I not your Lord!&#34; They said&#59;&#34;Yes! We testify,&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah made them testify with themselves by circumstance and words. Testimony is sometimes given in words, such as, <b> <br />قَالُواْ شَهِدْنَا عَلَى أَنفُسِنَا <br /></b> (They will say&#59;&#34;We bear witness against ourselves&#34;). (6&#59;130) <br /> <br />At other times, testimony is given by the people themselves, such as Allah's statement, <br />مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُواْ مَسَاجِدَ الله شَاهِدِينَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ بِالْكُفْرِ <br /> (It is not for the Mushrikin, (polytheists) to maintain the mosques of Allah, while they testify against their own selves of disbelief). (9&#59;17) <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means that their disbelief testifies against them, not that they actually testify against themselves here. <br /> <br />Another <b>Ayah</b> of this type is Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَإِنَّهُ عَلَى ذَلِكَ لَشَهِيدٌ <br /></b>(And to that he bears witness (by his deeds). (100&#59;7) <br /> <br />The same is the case with asking, sometimes takes the form of words and sometimes a situation or circumstance. For instance, Allah said, <br />وَاتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ <br /> (And He gave you of all that you asked for). (14&#59;34) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />أَن تَقُولُواْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /> <br />lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هَذَا <br /> <br />we were of this (of <b>Tawhid</b>), <br /> <br />غَافِلِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 171" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-171/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">172</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>172</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 173" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-173/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=172;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
