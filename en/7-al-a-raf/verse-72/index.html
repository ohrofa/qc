They were subjected to it for seven nights and eight days in succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms! Do you see any remnants of them! (69&#59;6-8) <br /> <br />When <b>`Ad</b> rebelled and transgressed, Allah destroyed them with a strong wind that carried them, one by one, up in the air and brought each one of them down on his head, thus smashing his head and severing it from its body. This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ <br /> <br />as if they were hollow trunks of date palms! (69&#59;7) <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that; <br /><b>`Ad</b> used to live in Yemen between Oman and Hadramawt. They also spread throughout the land and defeated various peoples, because of the strength that Allah gave them. <br /> <br />They used to worship idols instead of Allah, and Allah sent to them Prophet Hud, peace be upon him. He was from their most common lineage and was the best among them in status. <br /> <br />Hud commanded them to worship Allah Alone and associate none with him. He also ordered them to stop committing injustice against the people. But they rejected him and ignored his call. They said, `Who is stronger than us!' <br /> <br />Some of them, however, followed Hud, although they were few and had to conceal their faith. When <b>`Ad</b> defied the command of Allah, rejected His Prophet, committed mischief in the earth, became arrogant and built high palaces on every high place -- without real benefit to them -- Hud spoke to them, saying, <br /> <br />أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ <br /> <br />وَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ <br /> <br />وَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ <br /> <br />&#34;Do you build high palaces on every high place, while you do not live in them And do you get for yourselves palaces (fine buildings) as if you will live therein forever. And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants. <br /> <br />Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, and obey me.&#34; (26&#59;128-131) <br /> <br />However, <br /> <br />قَالُواْ يَهُودُ مَا جِيْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِى ءالِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُوْمِنِينَ إِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;O Hud! No evidence have you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your (mere) saying! And we are not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods have seized you with evil.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, madness, <br /> <br />إِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّى أُشْهِدُ اللَّهِ وَاشْهَدُواْ أَنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ <br /> <br /> مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ <br /> <br />إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ مَّا مِن دَابَّةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ ءاخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَأ إِنَّ رَبِّى عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;I call Allah to witness, and bear you witness that I am free from that which you associate with Him. So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He has the grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path (the truth).&#34; (11&#59;53-56) <br /><b>Story of the Emissary of `Ad</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Harith Al-Bakri said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;I went to the Messenger of Allah to complain to him about Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami. When I passed by the area of Ar-Rabdhah, I found an old woman from Bani Tamim who was alone in that area. She said to me, &#34;O servant of Allah! I need to reach the Messenger of Allah to ask him for some of my needs, will you take me to him&#34; <br /> <br />So I took her along with me to Al-Madinah and found the <b>Masjid</b> full of people. I also found a black flag raised high, while Bilal was holding a sword before the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />I asked, &#34;What is the matter with the people?&#34; <br /> <br />They said, &#34;The Prophet intends to send Amr bin Al-`As (on a military expedition) somewhere.&#34; <br /> <br />So I sat down. When the Prophet went to his house, I asked for permission to see him, and he gave me permission. I entered and greeted him. He said, &#34;Was there a dispute between you and Bani Tamim?&#34; <br /> <br />I said, &#34;Yes. And we had been victorious over them. I passed by an old woman from Bani Tamim, who was alone, and she asked me to bring her to you, and she is at the door.&#34; <br /> <br />So he allowed her in and I said, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! What if you make a barrier between us and (the tribe of) Bani Tamim, such as Ad-Dahna' (Desert)?&#34; <br /> <br />The old woman became angry and opposed me. <br /> <br />So I said, &#34;My example is the example of a sheep that carried its own destruction. I carried this woman and did not know that she was an opponent. I seek refuge with Allah and His Messenger that I become like the emissary of <b>`Ad</b>.'&#34; <br /> <br />So the Prophet asked me about the emissary of <b>`Ad</b>, having better knowledge in it, but he liked to hear the story again. <br /> <br />I said, <br /> <br />&#34;Once, <b>`Ad</b> suffered from a famine and they sent an emissary (to get relief), whose name was Qayl. Qayl passed by Mu`awiyah bin Bakr and stayed with him for a month. Mu`awiyah supplied him with alcoholic drinks, and two female singers were singing for him. When a month ended, Qayl went to the mountains of Muhrah and said, <br /> <br />`O Allah! You know that I did not come here to cure an ill person or to ransom a prisoner. O Allah! Give <b>`Ad</b> water as You used to.' <br /> <br />So black clouds came and he was called, `Choose which one of them you wish (to go to <b>`Ad</b>)!' <br /> <br />So he pointed to one of the black clouds and he heard someone proclaiming from it, `Take it, as ashes that will leave none in <b>`Ad</b>.' <br /> <br />And it has been conveyed to me that the wind sent to them was no more than what would pass through this ring of mine, but it destroyed them.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Wa'il said, <br /> <br />&#34;That is true. When a man or a woman would send an emissary, they would tell him, `Do not be like the emissary of <b>`Ad</b> (bringing disaster and utter destruction to them instead of relief).,&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad collected this story in the <b>Musnad</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded similar wording for it, as did An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>So We delivered him, namely, Hd, and those with him, from among the believers, by a mercy from Us, and We cut the root of those, people, who denied Our signs, that is, We extirpated them, and were not believers (wa-m kn mu'minna is a supplement to kadhdhab, `[those who] denied').</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>We saved him and those who adhered to him.
