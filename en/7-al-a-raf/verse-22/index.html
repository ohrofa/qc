Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b said, <br /> <br />&#34;Adam was a tall man, about the height of a palm tree, and he had thick hair on his head. When he committed the error that he committed, his private part appeared to him while before, he did not see it. So he started running in fright through Paradise, but a tree in Paradise took him by the head. He said to it, `Release me,' but it said, `No, I will not release you.' So his Lord called him, `O Adam! Do you run away from Me!' <br /> <br />He said, `O Lord! I felt ashamed before You.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah collected this statement using several chains of narration from Al-Hasan from Ubayy bin Ka`b who narrated it from the Prophet. However, relating the <b>Hadith</b> to Ubayy is more correct. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ <br /> (And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise). <br /> <br />&#34;Using fig leaves.&#34; <br /> <br />This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Mujahid said that they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise, <br /> <br />&#34;Making them as a dress (or garment).&#34; <br /> <br />Commenting on Allah's statement, <br />يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا <br /> (Stripping them of their raiment) (7&#59;27) Wahb bin Munabbih said, <br /> <br />&#34;The private parts of Adam and Hawwa' had a light covering them which prevented them from seeing the private parts of each other. When they ate from the tree, their private parts appeared to them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported this statement with an authentic chain of narration. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported from Qatadah, <br /> <br />&#34;Adam said, `O Lord! What if I repented and sought forgiveness!' <br /> <br />Allah said, `Then, I will admit you into Paradise.' As for <b>Shaytan</b>, he did not ask for forgiveness, but for respite. Each one of them was given what he asked for.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 21" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">22</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>22</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 23" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
