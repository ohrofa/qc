Beware! their auspice (whether evil or good) was decreed by God, but most of them did not know (being ignorant of true knowledge).</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>But when something good came their way, they said, `This is ours (as we deserved it),´ and if something adverse befell them they would attribute their ill luck to Moses and his companions.
