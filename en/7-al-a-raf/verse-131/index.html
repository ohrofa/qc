Why, surely their ill augury was with God; but the most of them knew not.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>then, when something good came their way, they said, ‘This is our due!’. When something bad came, they ascribed it to the evil omen of Moses and those with him, but their ‘evil omen’ was really from God, though most of them did not realize it.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>So whenever good-hap came unto them, they would say: ours is this. And if a mishap afflicted them, they would lay it to the evil augury of Musa and these with him. Behold! their evil augury was only with Allah, but most of them knew not.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>But when good (times) came, they said, &#34;This is due to us;&#34; When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him!
