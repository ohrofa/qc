In another instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَأ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّأ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ <br /> <br />Was there any town (community) that believed (after seeing the punishment), and its faith (at that moment) saved it (from the punishment) -- Except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the (present) world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while. (10&#59;98) <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that no city believed in its entirety, except the city of Prophet Yunus, for they all believed after they were stricken by punishment. <br /> <br />Allah said (about Prophet Yunus), <br /> <br />وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْيَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ <br /> <br />فَـَامَنُواْ فَمَتَّعْنَـهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ <br /> <br />And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more. And they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while. (37&#59;147-148) <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ <br /> <br />And We did not send a warner to a township.... (34&#59;34) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَى امَنُواْ وَاتَّقَواْ <br /> <br />And if the people of the towns had believed and had <b>Taqwa</b>... <br /> <br />meaning their hearts had faith in what the Messenger brought them, believed and obeyed him, and had <b>Taqwa</b> by performing the acts of obedience and abstaining from the prohibitions, <br /> <br />لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَاتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَاء وَالَارْضِ <br /> <br />We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, <br /> <br />in reference to the rain that falls from the sky and the vegetation of the earth. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن كَذَّبُواْ فَأَخَذْنَاهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn. <br /> <br />They denied their Messengers, so that We punished them and sent destruction on them as a result of the sins and wickedness that they earned. <br /> <br />Allah then said, while warning and threatening against defying His orders and daring to commit His prohibitions</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 95" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-95/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">96</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>96</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 97" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-97/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=96;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
