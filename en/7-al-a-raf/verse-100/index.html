Then they followed their own ways, and behaved as they did and were unruly with their Lord. (Did We not make clear to them) that, <br />أَن لَّوْ نَشَاء أَصَبْنَاهُم بِذُنُوبِهِمْ <br /> (that had We willed, We would have punished them for their sins) by bringing them the same end that was decreed for those before them, <br /> <br />وَنَطْبَعُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ <br /> <br />And We seal up their hearts, <br /> <br />We place a cover over their heart, <br /> <br />فَهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />so that they hear not, <br /> <br />words of advice or reminding&#34;' <br /> <br />I say that similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />أَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَـكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَايَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى <br /> <br />Is it not a guidance for them&#59;how many generations We have destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they walk Verily, in this are signs indeed for men of understanding. (20&#59;128) <br /> <br />أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَاتٍ أَفَلَ يَسْمَعُونَ <br /> <br />Is it not a guidance for them&#59;how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings they do walk about Verily, therein indeed are signs. Would they not then listen! (32&#59;26) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍوَسَكَنتُمْ فِى مَسَـكِنِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ <br /> <br />Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter). And you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves! (14&#59;44-45) <br /> <br />Also, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً <br /> <br />And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them! (19&#59;98) <br /> <br />meaning, do you see any of them or hear their voices. <br /> <br />There are many other <b>Ayat</b> that testify that Allah's torment strikes His enemies, while His bounty reaches His faithful believers. Thereafter comes Allah's statement, and He is the Most Truthful, the Lord of all that exists</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 99" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-99/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">100</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>100</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 101" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-101/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
