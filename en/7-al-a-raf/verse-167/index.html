Thus, God sent Solomon against them, and after him, Nebuchadnezzar, who slaughtered [some of] them and took [others among] them captive, and imposed the jizya-tax on them. They continued to pay this [tax] to the Magians up until the [time of the] sending of our Prophet (s), who [also] imposed it on them. Lo! verily your Lord is swift in requital, of those who disobey Him. And lo! verily He is Forgiving, to those who obey Him, Merciful, [in dealing] with them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Eternal Humiliation placed on the Jews</b> <br /> <br />Allah reminds; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />And (remember) when your Lord declared that He would certainly keep on sending against them, <br /> <br />تَأَذَّنَ <br /> (<b>Ta'dhdhana</b>) means <br /> <br />`declared', according to Mujahid, or <br /> <br />`ordained', according to others. <br /> <br />This part of the <b>Ayah</b> indicates a vow, <br />لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> (that He will keep on sending against them) against the Jews, <br /> <br />إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَن يَسُومُهُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with a humiliating torment. <br /> <br />on account of their disobedience, defying Allah's orders and Law and using tricks to transgress the prohibitions. <br /> <br />It was reported that Musa required the Jews to pay the production tax for seven or thirteen years, and he was the first to do so. <br /> <br />Also, the Jews fell under the humiliating rule of the Greek Kushdanin, Chaldeans and later on the Christians, who subjugated and disgraced them, and required them to pay the <b>Jizyah</b> (tribute tax). <br /> <br />When Islam came and Muhammad was sent, they became under his power and had to pay the <b>Jizyah</b>, as well. <br /> <br />Therefore, the humiliating torment mentioned here includes disgrace and paying the <b>Jizyah</b>, as Al-Awfi narrated from Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />In the future, the Jews will support the <b>Dajjal</b> (False Messiah); and the Muslims, along with Isa, son of Mary, will kill the Jews. This will occur just before the end of this world. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ <br /> <br />Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution, <br /> <br />with those who disobey Him and defy His Law, <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />for those who repent and go back to Him. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> mentions both the mercy, as well as, the punishment, so that no despair is felt. Allah often mentions encouragement and warning together, so that hearts always have a sense of hope and fear</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 166" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-166/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">167</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>167</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 168" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-168/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
