But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one (of Lut and his daughters). (51&#59;35-36) <br /> <br />Only his wife (from his family) did not believe, remaining on the religion of her people. She used to conspire with them against Lut and inform them of who came to visit him, using certain signals that they agreed on. This is why when Lut was commanded to leave by night with his family, he was ordered not to inform his wife or take her with him. <br /> <br />Some said that she followed them, and when the torment struck her people, she looked back and suffered the same punishment as them. <br /> <br />However, it appears that she did not leave the town and that Lut did not tell her that they would depart. So she remained with her people, as apparent from Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ الْغَابِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />except his wife; she was of the <b>Ghabirin</b>. <br /> <br />meaning, of those who remained, or they say&#59;of those who were destroyed, and this is the more obvious explanation. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 82" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>83</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 84" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
