In their pursuit, Fir`awn and his soldiers went in the sea chasing Musa and his people. When they all had gone inside the water, the sea closed in on them and they all drowned, because they belied the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and were heedless of them. Allah said that He has granted the people who were considered weak, the Children of Israel, to inherit the eastern and western parts of the land. <br /> <br />مَشَارِقَ الَارْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا <br />the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah commented that Allah's statement, <br /> <br />refers to the Sham area (Greater Syria). <br /> <br />وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ الْحُسْنَى عَلَى بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ <br /> <br />And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. <br /> <br />Mujahid and Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement, is explained by Allah's other statement, <br /> <br />وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَيِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ <br /> <br />وَنُمَكِّنَ لَهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَنُرِىَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَحْذَرونَ <br /> <br />And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak (and oppressed) in the land, and to make them rulers and to make them the inheritors.
