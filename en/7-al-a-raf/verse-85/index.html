He said, `O my people, worship God! You have no god other than Him. Verily there has come to you a clear proof, a miracle, from your Lord, to [prove] my truthfulness. So give full measure and weight and do not defraud, diminish [the value of], people's goods, and do not work corruption in the earth, by way of unbelief and acts of disobedience, after it has been set right, through the sending of messengers [thereto]. That, mentioned, is better for you, if you are believers, [if you are] seekers of faith, so hasten to it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Story of Shu`ayb, upon him be Peace, and the Land of Madyan</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَإِلَى مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا <br /> <br />And to (the people of) Madyan, (We sent) their brother Shu`ayb. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said, <br /> <br />&#34;They (the people of Madyan) are the descendents of Madyan, son of Midyan, son of Ibrahim. Shu`ayb was the son of Mikil bin Yashjur. And in the Syrian language, his name was Yathrun (Jethro).&#34; <br /> <br />I (Ibn Kathir) say, <br /> <br />Madyan was the name of the tribe and also a city that is close to Ma`an on route to the Hijaz (from Ash-Sham). <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَأءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ <br /> <br />And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks). (28&#59;23) <br /> <br />They are also the people of Al-Aykah (the Woods), as we will mention later on, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him. <br /> <br />قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him,&#34; <br /> <br />and this is the call of all Messengers, <br /> <br />قَدْ جَاءتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />&#34;Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you;&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, <br /> <br />`Allah has presented the proof and evidences of the truth of what I brought you.' <br /> <br />He then advised and commanded them, <br /> <br />فَأَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ وَلَا تَبْخَسُواْ النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءهُمْ <br /> <br />so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, <br /> <br />meaning, to refrain from cheating people in buying and selling. <br /> <br />They used to treacherously avoid giving full weight and measure. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <b> <br />وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ <br /> </b> (Woe to <b>Al-Mutaffifin</b> (those who give less in measure and weight)... (83&#59;1) until He said, <b> <br />لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ <br /></b> (before the Lord of all that exists).
