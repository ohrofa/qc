Our Lord embraces all things through His knowledge, that is to say, His knowledge embraces all things, including my situation and yours. In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, decide, adjudicate, between us and our people, for You are the best of deciders', adjudicators.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>قَدِ افْتَرَيْنَا عَلَى اللّهِ كَذِبًا إِنْ عُدْنَا فِي مِلَّتِكُم بَعْدَ إِذْ نَجَّانَا اللّهُ مِنْهَا <br /> <br />&#34;We should have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion, after Allah has rescued us from it. <br /> <br />Certainly if we revert to your religion and accept your ways, we will have uttered a tremendous lie against Allah by calling partners as rivals to Him, <br /> <br />وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَا أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَا إِلاَّ أَن يَشَاء اللّهُ رَبُّنَا <br /> <br />And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah, our Lord, should will. <br /> <br />This part of the <b>Ayah</b> refers all matters to Allah's will, and certainly, He has perfect knowledge of all matters and His observation encompasses all things, <br /> <br />وَسِعَ رَبُّنَا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا <br /> <br />Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. <br /> <br />عَلَى اللّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا <br /> <br />In Allah (Alone) we put our trust. <br /> <br />concerning all our affairs, what we practice of them and what we ignore, <br /> <br />رَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ <br /> <br />Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, <br /> <br />judge between us and our people and give us victory over them, <br /> <br />وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْفَاتِحِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for You are the best of those who give judgment. <br /> <br />and You are the Most Just Who never wrongs any in His judgment</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 88" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-88/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">89</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>89</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 90" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
