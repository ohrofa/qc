Rather, Fir`awn and his people are the mischief-makers, but they did not realize it. They said, <br /> <br />وَيَذَرَكَ وَالِهَتَكَ <br /> <br />&#34;and to abandon you and your gods.&#34; <br /> <br />`Your gods', <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, as As-Suddi narrated from him, <br /> <br />&#34;Were cows. Whenever they saw a beautiful cow, Fir`awn would command them to worship it. This is why As-Samiri, made the statue of a calf that seemed to moo for the Children of Israel.&#34; <br /> <br />Fir`awn accepted his people's recommendation, <br /> <br />قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَاءهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِـي نِسَاءهُمْ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;We will kill their sons, and let their women live,&#34; <br /> <br />thus reiterating his previous order concerning the Children of Israel. <br /> <br />وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and we have indeed irresistible power over them.&#34; <br /> <br />He had tormented them (killing every newly born male) before Musa was born, so that Musa would not live. However, the opposite of what Fir`awn sought and intended occurred. The same end struck Fir`awn that he intended to subjugate and humiliate the Children of Israel with. Allah gave victory to the Children of Israel, humiliated and disgraced Fir`awn, and caused him to drown along with his soldiers.
