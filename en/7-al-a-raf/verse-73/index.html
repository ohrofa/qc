They dwelled between the area of the Hijaz (Western Arabia) and Ash-Sham (Greater Syria). <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah passed by the area and ruins of <b>Thamud</b> when he went to Tabuk (in northern Arabia) during the ninth year of <b>Hijrah</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah went to the area of Al-Hijr in Tabuk with the people, he camped near the homes of <b>Thamud</b>, in Al-Hijr and the people brought water from the wells that <b>Thamud</b> used before. They used that water to make dough and placed the pots (on fire) for cooking. However, the Prophet commanded them to spill the contents of the pots and to give the dough to their camels. He then marched forth with them from that area to another area, near the well that the camel (as will follow) used to drink from. He forbade the Companions from entering the area where people were tormented, saying, <br /> <br />إِنِّي أَخْشَى أَنْ يُصِيبَكُمْ مِثْلُ مَا أَصَابَهُمْ فَلَ تَدْخُلُوا عَلَيْهِم <br /> <br />I fear that what befell them might befall you as well. Therefore, do not enter on them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad narrated that Abdullah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said while in the Hijr area, <br /> <br />لَاا تَدْخُلُوا عَلَى هوُلَااءِ الْمُعَذَّبِينَ إِلاَّ أَنْ تَكُونُوا بَاكِينَ فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُونُوا بَاكِينَ فَلَا تَدْخُلُوا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنْ يُصِيبَكُمْ مِثْلَ مَا أَصَابَهُم <br /> <br />Do not enter on these who were tormented, unless you do so while crying. If you are not crying, then do not enter on them, so that what befell them does not befall you, as well. <br /> <br />The basis of this <b>Hadith</b> is mentioned in Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /><b>The Story of Prophet Salih and Thamud</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِلَى ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا <br /> <br />And to <b>Thamud</b> (people, We sent) their brother Salih. <br /> <br />meaning, to the tribe of Thamud, We sent their brother Salih, <br /> <br />قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god but Him.&#34; <br /> <br />All Allah's Messengers called to the worship of Allah alone without partners. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ <br /> <br />And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying)&#59;&#34;None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.&#34; (21&#59;25) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ <br /> <br />And verily, We have sent among every <b>Ummah</b> a Messenger (proclaiming)&#59;&#34;Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid <b>Taghut</b> (all false deities).&#34; (16&#59;36) <br /><b>Thamud asked that a Camel appear from a Stone, and it did</b> <br /> <br />Prophet Salih said, <br /> <br />قَدْ جَاءتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ هَـذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللّهِ لَكُمْ ايَةً <br /> <br />&#34;Indeed there has come to you a clear sign from your Lord. This she-camel of Allah is a sign unto you;&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, a miracle has come to you from Allah testifying to the truth of what I came to you with. <br /> <br />Salih's people asked him to produce a miracle and suggested a certain solid rock that they chose, which stood lonely in the area of Hijr, and which was called Al-Katibah. They asked him to bring a pregnant camel out of that stone. <br /> <br />Salih took their covenant and promises that if Allah answers their challenge, they would believe and follow him. When they gave him their oaths and promises to that, Salih started praying and invoked Allah (to produce that miracle). All of a sudden, the stone moved and broke apart, producing a she-camel with thick wool. It was pregnant and its fetus was visibly moving in its belly, exactly as Salih's people asked. This is when their chief, Jundu bin `Amr, and several who followed him believed. <br /> <br />The rest of the noblemen of <b>Thamud</b> wanted to believe as well, but Dhu'ab bin `Amr bin Labid, Al-Habbab, who tended their idols, and Rabbab bin Sum`ar bin Jilhis stopped them. <br /> <br />One of the cousins of Jundu bin `Amr, whose name was Shihab bin Khalifah bin Mikhlat bin Labid bin Jawwas, was one of the leaders of <b>Thamud</b>, and he also wanted to accept the message. However, the chiefs whom we mentioned prevented him, and he conceded to their promptings. <br /> <br />The camel remained in <b>Thamud</b>, as well as, its offspring after she delivered it before them. The camel used to drink from its well on one day and leave the well for <b>Thamud</b> the next day. They also used to drink its milk, for on the days she drank water, they used to milk her and fill their containers from its milk. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَنَبِّيْهُمْ أَنَّ الْمَأءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ كُلُّ شِرْبٍ مُّحْتَضَرٌ <br /> <br />And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them, each one's right to drink being established (by turns). (54&#59;28) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />هَـذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَّهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ <br /> <br />Here is a she-camel&#59;it has a right to drink (water), and you have a right to drink (water) (each) on a day, known. (26&#59;155) <br /> <br />The camel used to graze in some of their valleys, going through a pass and coming out through another pass. She did that so as to be able to move easily, because she used to drink a lot of water. She was a tremendous animal that had a strikingly beautiful appearance. When she used to pass by their cattle, the cattle would be afraid of her. <br /> <br />When this matter continued for a long time and <b>Thamud's</b> rejection of Salih became intense, they intended to kill her so that they could take the water for themselves every day. It was said that all of them (the disbelievers of <b>Thamud</b>) conspired to kill the camel. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that he was told that, <br /> <br />&#34;The designated killer of the camel approached them all, including women in their rooms and children, and found out that all of them agreed to kill her.&#34; This fact is apparent from the wording of the <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَعَقَرُوهَا فَدَمْدمَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسَوَّاهَا <br /> <br />Then they denied him and they killed it. So their Lord destroyed them because of their sin, and made them equal in destruction! (91&#59;14) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَءَاتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُواْ بِهَا <br /> <br />And We sent the she-camel to <b>Thamud</b> as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. (17&#59;59) <br /> <br />فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِي أَرْضِ اللّهِ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوَءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />so you leave her to graze in Allah's earth, and touch her not with harm, lest a painful torment should seize you. <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَاء مِن بَعْدِ عَادٍ وَبَوَّأَكُمْ فِي الَارْضِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِن سُهُولِهَا قُصُورًا وَتَنْحِتُونَ الْجِبَالَ بُيُوتًا فَاذْكُرُواْ الاء اللّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الَارْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 72" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">73</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>73</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 74" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
