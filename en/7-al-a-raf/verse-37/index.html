And when Our messengers come to them to take away their souls, they shall ask them, &#34;Where are those you used to call upon besides God?&#34; They will answer, &#34;They have deserted us;&#34; and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers?</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>Who does greater wrong than he who invents lies about God, or denies His revelations? These—their share of the decree will reach them. Until, when Our envoys come to them, to take their souls away, they will say, “Where are they whom you used to pray to besides God?” They will say, “They have abandoned us,” and they will testify against themselves that they were faithless.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And who -- that is, none -- does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, by ascribing to Him a partner or a child, or denies His signs?, the Qur'n. Those -- their portion, their lot, of the Scripture, of what has been inscribed as theirs in the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz), in the way of provision, term [of life] and other matters, shall reach them until, when Our messengers, the angels, come to them, to take their souls, they say, to them, in reprimand&#59; `Where is that which you were calling upon, worshipping, beside God?' They will say, `They have gone astray from us', they are not present [before us], and so we cannot see them; and they will bear witness against themselves, upon death, that they were disbelievers.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Idolators enjoy Their destined Share in This Life, but will lose Their Supporters upon Death</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِأيَاتِهِ <br /> <br />Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, none is more unjust than whoever invents a lie about Allah or rejects the <b>Ayat</b> that He has revealed. <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُم مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ <br /> <br />For such their appointed portion will reach them from the Book, <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that, <br /> <br />it refers to each person's deeds, allotted provisions and age. <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />Allah said in similar statements, <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br />مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ <br /> <br />Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successful. (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve. (10&#59;69-70) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَن كَفَرَ فَلَ يَحْزُنكَ كُفْرُهُ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَنُنَبِّيُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ <br /> <br />نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلً <br /> <br />And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men). We let them enjoy for a little while. (31&#59;23-24) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا جَاءتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />until when Our messengers come to them to take their souls. <br /> <br />Allah states that when death comes to the idolators and the angels come to capture their souls to take them to Hellfire, the angels horrify them, saying, <br /> <br />قَالُواْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />they (the angels) will say&#59;&#34;Where are those whom you used to invoke and worship besides Allah,&#34; <br /> <br />&#34;Where are the so-called partners (of Allah) whom you used to call in the life of this world, invoking and worshipping them instead of Allah Call them so that they save you from what you are suffering.&#34; <br /> <br />However, the idolators will reply, <br /> <br />قَالُواْ ضَلُّواْ عَنَّا <br /> <br />they will reply, &#34;They have vanished and deserted us.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, we have lost them and thus, we do not hope in their benefit or aid, <br /> <br />وَشَهِدُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />And they will bear witness against themselves, <br /> <br />they will admit and proclaim against themselves, <br /> <br />أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that they were disbelievers</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 36" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-36/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">37</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>37</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 38" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-38/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
