Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoers.Then <b>Shaytan</b> whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts (before); <br /> <br />Allah states that He allowed Adam and his wife to dwell in Paradise and to eat from all of its fruits, except one tree. <br /> <br />We have already discussed this in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>. <br /> <br />Thus, <b>Shaytan</b> envied them and plotted deceitfully, whispering and suggesting treachery. He wished to rid them of the various favors and nice clothes that they were enjoying. <br /> <br />وَقَالَ <br /> <br />He (<b>Shaytan</b>) said, <br /> <br />uttering lies and falsehood, <br /> <br />مَا نَهَاكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةِ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ <br /> <br />&#34;Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels...&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, so that you do not become angels or dwell here for eternity. <br /> <br />أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ الْخَالِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />or become of the immortals.&#34; <br /> <br />Surely, if you eat from this tree, you will attain both, he said. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى <br /><b>Shaytan</b> whispered to him, saying&#59;&#34;O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away.&#34; (20&#59;120) <br /> <br />Here, the wording is similar, so it means, `so that you do not become angels,' as in; <br /> <br />يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّواْ <br /> <br />(Thus) does Allah make clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. (4&#59;176) <br /> <br />meaning, so that you do not go astray, <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَأَلْقَى فِى الاٌّرْضِ رَوَاسِىَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ <br /> <br />And He has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; (16&#59;15) <br /> <br />that is, so that the earth does not shake with you</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 19" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 21" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
