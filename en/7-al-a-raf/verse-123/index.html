(20&#59;71) <br /> <br />However, Fir`awn and all those who had any sense of reason knew for sure that what Fir`awn said was utterly false. As soon as Musa came from Madyan, he called Fir`awn to Allah and demonstrated tremendous miracles and clear proofs for the Truth that he brought. Fir`awn then sent emissaries to various cities of his kingdom and collected magicians who were scattered throughout Egypt. Fir`awn and his people chose from them, summoned them, and Fir`awn promised them great rewards. These magicians were very eager to prevail over Musa in front of Fir`awn, so that they might become closer to him. Musa neither knew any of them nor saw or met them before. Fir`awn knew that, but he claimed otherwise to deceive the ignorant masses of his kingdom, just as Allah described them, <b> <br />فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ <br /></b> (Thus he (Fir`awn) fooled his people, and they obeyed him. (43&#59;54) Certainly, a people who believed Fir`awn in his statement, <b> <br />أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الاَْعْلَى <br /></b> (I am your lord, most high). (79&#59;24), are among the most ignorant and misguided creatures of Allah. <br /> <br />In his Tafsir, As-Suddi reported that Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn Abbas, and several other Companions, commented, <br />إِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ <br /> (Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city...), <br /> <br />&#34;Musa met the leader of the magicians and said to him, `If I defeat you, will you believe in me and bear witness that what I brought is the truth.' <br /> <br />The magician said, `Tomorrow, I will produce a type of magic that cannot be defeated by another magic. By Allah! If you defeat me, I will believe in you and testify to your truth.' <br /> <br />Fir`awn was watching them, and this is why he said what he said.&#34; <br /> <br />His statement, <br />لِتُخْرِجُواْ مِنْهَا أَهْلَهَا <br /> (to drive out its people), <br /> <br />means, so that you all cooperate to gain influence and power, replacing the chiefs and masters of this land. In this case, power in the state will be yours, <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;but you shall come to know,&#34; <br /> <br />what I will do to you. <br /> <br />He then explained his threat</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 122" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">123</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>123</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 124" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-124/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
