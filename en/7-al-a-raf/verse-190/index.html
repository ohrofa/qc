Samura [b. Jundub] reported that the Prophet (s) said, `On one occasion when Eve gave birth -- all the children she bore had failed to survive -- Satan visited her and said [to her], &#34;Name it [the child] `Abd al-Hrith, and it will live.&#34; She named it so and it lived. This [affair] was the result of Satan's inspiration and his doings'&#59; reported by al-Hkim, who deemed it [the report] `sound' (sahh), and [also reported] by al-Tirmidh, who considered it `fair-uncommon' (hasan gharb); but exalted is God above what they, the people of Mecca, associate, in the way of idols (this sentence is consequent, a supplement to [the one beginning with] khalaqakum, `He created you', so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement).</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>we shall indeed be among the grateful. But when He gave them a <b>Salih</b> child, they ascribed partners to Him (Allah) in that which He has given to them. High be Allah, Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners to Him. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Hasan commented on this part of the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />جَعَلَ لَهُ شُرَكَاء فِيمَا اتَاهُمَا <br /> (they ascribed partners to Him (Allah) in that which He has given to them), <br /> <br />&#34;This occurred by followers of some religion, not from Adam (or <b>Hawwa</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan also said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> refers to those among the offspring of Adam who fell into <b>Shirk</b>, <br />جَعَلَ لَهُ شُرَكَاء فِيمَا اتَاهُمَا <br /> (they ascribed partners to Him (Allah) in that which He has given to them),&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Al-Hasan used to say that it refers to the Jews and Christians. Allah gave them children, and they turned them into Jews and Christians.&#34; <br /> <br />The explanations from Al-Hasan have authentic chains of narration leading to him, and certainly, it is one of the best interpretations. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> should therefore be understood this way, for it is apparent that it does not refer to Adam and Hawwa, but about the idolators among their offspring. Allah mentioned the person first (Adam and Hawwa) and then continued to mention the species (mankind, many of whom committed <b>Shirk</b>). <br /> <br />There are similar cases in the Qur'an. For such cases, Allah said <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا السَّمَأءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ <br /> <br />And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps. (67&#59;5) <br /> <br />It is well-known that the stars that were made as lamps in the sky are not the same as the shooting missiles that are thrown at the devils (mentioned later in the <b>Ayah</b>). <br /> <br />There are similar instances in the Qur'an. Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 189" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-189/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأعراف<span class="num-ar">7</span> :<span class="num-ar">190</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-A'raf<span> 7</span>:<span>190</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-A&#39;raf Verse 191" href="/en/7-al-a-raf/verse-191/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=7,sura_dir="al-a-raf",count_ayat=206,number_aya=190;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
