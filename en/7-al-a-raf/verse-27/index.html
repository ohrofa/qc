Let not <b>Shaytan</b> deceive you, as he got your parents out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiment, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and his tribe see you from where you cannot see them. Verily, We made the <b>Shayatin</b> friends of those who believe not. <br /> <br />Allah warns the Children of Adam against <b>Iblis</b> and his followers, by explaining about his ancient enmity for the father of mankind, Adam peace be upon him. <b>Iblis</b> plotted to have Adam expelled from Paradise, which is the dwelling of comfort, to the dwelling of hardship and fatigue (this life) and caused him to have his private part uncovered, after it had been hidden from him. This, indeed, is indicative of deep hatred (from <b>Shaytan</b> towards Adam and mankind). <br /> <br />Allah said in a similar <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَأءَ مِن دُونِى وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ بِيْسَ لِلظَّـلِمِينَ بَدَلاً <br /> <br />Will you then take him (<b>Iblis</b>) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me, while they are enemies to you! What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.
