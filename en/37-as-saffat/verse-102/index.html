It was said that he used to ride on <b>Al-Buraq</b>, traveling there swiftly, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />It was reported from Ibn Abbas, peace be upon him, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Zayd bin Aslam and others that <br />فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْيَ <br /> (And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him), means, <br /> <br />when he became a young man and was able to work as his father did. <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْيَ قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ إِنِّي أَرَى فِي الْمَنَامِ أَنِّي أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى <br /> <br />And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!&#34; <br /> <br />`Ubayd bin Umayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;The dreams of the Prophets are revelation,&#34; then he recited this Ayah&#59; <br />قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ إِنِّي أَرَى فِي الْمَنَامِ أَنِّي أَذْبَحُكَ فَانظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى <br /> (he said&#59;&#34;O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So look what you think!&#34;). <br /> <br />He told his son that in order to make it easier for him, and also to test his patience and resolve, at a young age, in obeying Allah and obeying his father. <br /> <br />قَالَ يَا أَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُوْمَرُ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;O my father! Do that which you are commanded...&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, `obey the command of Allah and sacrifice me.' <br /> <br />سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاء اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّابِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />if Allah wills, you shall find me of the patient. <br /> <br />meaning, `I will be patient and will seek the reward for that with Allah.' <br /> <br />He, may peace and blessings be upon him, believed in what had been promised. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً <br /> <br />وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً <br /> <br />And mention in the Book Ismail. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family the <b>Salah</b> and the <b>Zakah</b>, and his Lord was pleased with him.
