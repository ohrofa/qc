Then Jibril, upon him be peace, took him to <b>Jamrat Al-`Aqabah</b> and the <b>Shaytan</b> appeared to him, so he stoned him with seven pebbles until he disappeared. Then he appeared him at <b>Al-Jamrah Al-Wusta</b> and he stoned him with seven pebbles. Then he laid him prostrate on his face. Ismail, peace be upon him, was wearing a white shirt, and he said, `O my father, I do not have any garment in which I can be shrouded apart from this; take it off me so that you can shroud me in it.' He started to take it off, then he was called from behind&#59; <br /> <br />وَنَادَيْنَاهُ أَنْ يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah As-Saffat Verse 102" href="/en/37-as-saffat/verse-102/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الصافات<span class="num-ar">37</span> :<span class="num-ar">103</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">As-Saffat<span> 37</span>:<span>103</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah As-Saffat Verse 104" href="/en/37-as-saffat/verse-104/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
