Allah knows best. <br /> <br />This is what is well known that the people all relate from each other. The Christians have no doubt held that the place of this occurrence was Bethlehem and this is what all the people relate. It has been related in a <b>Hadith</b> also, if the <b>Hadith</b> is authentic. <br /> <br />Allah says, informing about her, <br /> <br />قَالَتْ يَا لَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَذَا <br /> <br />She said&#59;&#34;Would that I had died before this, <br /> <br />In this is an evidence of the permissibility to wish for death when a calamity strikes. She knew that she was going to be tested with the birth, the people would not assist her, and they would not believe her story. After she was known as a devout worshipper among them, they now thought that she had become a fornicating whore. She said, <br />يَا لَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَذَا <br /> (Would that I had died before this), She said this to mean before this situation. <br /> <br />وَكُنتُ نَسْيًا مَّنسِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and I had been forgotten and out of sight! <br /> <br />This means, &#34;I wish I had not been created and I was nothing.&#34; <br /> <br />This was mentioned by Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means something unknown, forgotten and no one knew who I was.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 22" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 24" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=19,sura_dir="maryam",count_ayat=98,number_aya=23;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
