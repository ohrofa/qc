For verily, her affair would be taken care of and her proof would be established. Thus, she accepted the command of Allah and she readily received His decree. She took her child and brought him to her people, carrying him. When they saw her like this they made a big deal about her situation and they sternly protested against of it, and <br /> <br />قَالُوا يَا مَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِيْتِ شَيْيًا فَرِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing <b>Fariy</b>.&#34; <br /><b>Fariy</b> means a mighty thing. <br /> <br />This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Nawf Al-Bikali that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Her people went out searching for her, she was from a family that was blessed with Prophethood and nobility. However, they could not find any trace of her. They came across a cow herder and they asked him, `Have you seen a girl whose description is such and such!' <br /> <br />He replied, `No, but tonight I saw my cows doing something that I've never seen them do before.' <br /> <br />They asked, `What did you see?' <br /> <br />He said, `Tonight I saw them prostrating in the direction of that valley.&#34;' <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Ziyad said (adding to the narration), <br /> <br />&#34;I memorized from Sayyar that he (the cattle herder) said, <br /> <br />`I saw a radiant light.&#34;' <br /> <br />So they went towards the direction that he told him, and Maryam was coming towards them from that direction. When she saw them she sat down and she was holding her child in her lap. They came towards her until they were standing over her. <br /> <br />قَالُوا يَا مَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِيْتِ شَيْيًا فَرِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;O Mary! Indeed you have brought a mighty thing (<b>Fariy</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />This means it was a mighty thing that she had brought</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 26" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">27</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>27</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 28" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=19,sura_dir="maryam",count_ayat=98,number_aya=27;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
