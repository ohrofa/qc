So they will meet <b>Ghaiy</b>. <br /> <br />After Allah mentioned the party of blessed ones -- the Prophets and those who followed them by maintaining the limits set by Allah and His commandments, fulfilling what Allah ordered and avoiding His prohibitions -- then He mentions, <br />خَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ <br /> (there has succeeded them a posterity). <br /> <br />This means later generations. <br /> <br />أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَةَ <br /> <br /> <br />who have lost <b>Salah</b>, <br /> <br />Losing their prayers is when they do not consider the prayers obligatory. Therefore they lose, because the prayer is the pillar and foundation of the religion. It is the best of the servants' deeds. Thus, these people will occupy themselves with worldly desires and delights, and they will be pleased with the life of this world. They will be tranquil and at ease in the worldly appetites. Therefore, these people will meet with <b>Ghaiy</b>, which means loss on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Al-Awza`i reported from Musa bin Sulayman, who reported from Al-Qasim bin Mukhaymirah that he said concerning Allah's statement, <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَةَ <br /> (Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have lost the <b>Salah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;This means that they will not keep up with the proper times of the prayer, because if it meant complete abandonment of the prayer, this would be disbelief.&#34; <br /> <br />It is also reported that it was said to Ibn Mas`ud, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah often mentions the prayer in the Qur'an. He says, <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَـتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ <br /> <br />Those who neglect their <b>Salah</b>. (107&#59;5) <br /> <br />And He says, <br /> <br />عَلَى صَلَتِهِمْ دَايِمُونَ <br /> <br />Those who remain constant in their <b>Salah</b>. (70&#59;23) <br /> <br />And He says, <br /> <br />عَلَى صَلَتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ <br /> <br />Who guard their <b>Salah</b>.&#34; (23&#59;9) <br /> <br />Then, Ibn Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means at its designated times.&#34; <br /> <br />The people said, &#34;We thought that this was referring to the abandonment of the prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />He replied, <br /> <br />&#34;That would be disbelief.&#34; <br /> <br />Masruq said, <br /> <br />&#34;No one who guards the five daily prayers will be written among the heedless. In their neglect is destruction. Their neglect is delaying them past their fixed times.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awza`i reported from Ibrahim bin Zayd that Umar bin Abdul-`Aziz recited the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَةَ وَاتَّبَعُوا الشَّهَوَاتِ <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا <br /> <br /> <br />Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have lost the <b>Salah</b> and have followed lusts. So they will meet <b>Ghayy</b>. <br /> <br />Then, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Their loss was not their abandonment of the prayers, but it was by not offering them during their proper and prescribed times.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا <br /> <br /> <br />So they will meet <b>Ghayy</b>. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means loss.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means evil.&#34; <br /> <br />Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah and Muhammad bin Ishaq all reported from Abu Ishaq As-Sabi`i, who reported from Abu Ubaydah, who reported from Abdullah bin Mas`ud that he said, <b> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا <br /></b> (So they will meet <b>Ghayy</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;This is a valley in the Hellfire which is very deep and its food is filthy.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-A`mash reported from Ziyad, who reported from Abu Iyad, who commented Allah's statement, <b> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَوْنَ غَيًّا <br /></b> (So they will meet <b>Ghayy</b>), He said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is a valley in Hell made of puss and blood.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 58" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 60" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
