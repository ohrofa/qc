Rather, it is referring to all of those who were Prophets. Allah merely changes the implication of the discussion from specific individuals to the entire group of Prophets. <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ادَمَ <br /> <br />they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam. <br /> <br />As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir both said, <br /> <br />&#34;That which is meant by the offspring of Adam is Idris, <br /> <br />and what is meant by the offspring of those `whom We carried with Nuh' is Ibrahim, <br /> <br />and what is meant by the offspring of Ibrahim is Ishaq, Yaqub and Ismail, <br /> <br />and what is meant by the offspring of Ismail is Musa, Harun, Zakariyya, Yahya and `Isa bin Maryam.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;And that is the distinction of their genealogies, even though Adam gathers all of them (as their original father). This is because among them is he who was not a descendant of those who were on the ship with Nuh, and he that is Idris. For verily, he was the grandfather of Nuh.&#34; <br /> <br />I say that this is the most apparent meaning, which concludes that Idris is amongst the pillars of Nuh's ancestral lineage. The view that this <b>Ayah</b> refers to the ancestral lineage of the Prophets, is the fact that it is similar to Allah's statement in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b>, <br /> <br />وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَأ ءَاتَيْنَـهَأ إِبْرَهِيمَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَـتٍ مَّن نَّشَأءُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br />وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلًّ هَدَيْنَا وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ <br /> <br />وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى وَإِلْيَاسَ كُلٌّ مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ <br /> <br />وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطاً وَكُلًّ فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />وَمِنْ ءابَايِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br />And that was our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We raise whom We will in degrees. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing. <br /> <br />And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Yaqub, each of them We guided; and before him We guided Nuh, and among his progeny Dawud, Suleiman, Ayub, Yusuf, Musa and Harun. Thus do We reward the doers of good. <br /> <br />And Zakariyya, and Yahya, and `Isa and Ilyas, each one of them was of the righteous. <br /> <br />And Ismail and Al-Yasa` and Yunus and Lut and each one of them We preferred above the <b>`Alamin</b>. <br /> <br />And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren, We chose them, and We guided them to the straight path. (6&#59;83-87) <br /> <br />Until Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ <br /> <br />They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance. (6&#59;90) <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, says, <br /> <br />مِنْهُم مَّن قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لَّمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ <br /> <br />Of some of them We have related to you their story. And of some We have not related to you their story. (40&#59;78) <br /> <br />In <b>Sahih</b> Al-Bukhari it is reported from Mujahid that he asked Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />&#34;Is there a prostration in Surah <b>Sad</b>&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas replied, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he recited, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ <br /> <br />They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance. (6&#59;90) <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas then said, &#34;So your Prophet is one of those who have been commanded to follow them. And he is of those who should be followed.&#34; -- referring to Dawud. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, said in this noble <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br /> <br />إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ايَاتُ الرَّحْمَن خَرُّوا سُجَّدًا وَبُكِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />When the <b>Ayah</b> of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping. <br /> <br />This means that when they heard the Words of Allah, mentioning His proofs and evidences, they prostrated to their Lord in humility, humbleness, praise and thanks for the great favors they were blessed with. <br /> <br />The word <b>Bukiyan</b> at the end of the <b>Ayah</b> means those who are crying, and it is the plural of <b>Baki</b>. <br /> <br />Due to this the scholars agree that it is legislated to prostrate upon reading this <b>Ayah</b>, in following them and adhering to their manner of worship</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 57" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">58</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>58</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 59" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
