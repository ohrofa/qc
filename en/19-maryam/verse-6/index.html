So give me from Yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me, <br /> <br />The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his Prophethood and that which was revealed to him. <br /> <br />In response to this I would like to point out that; <br /> <br />he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. <br /> <br />The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. <br /> <br />The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة <br /> <br />We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity. <br /> <br />In a narration recorded by At-Tirmidhi with an authentic chain of narrations, he said, <br /> <br />نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَث <br /> <br />We, Prophets do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). <br /> <br />Therefore, the meaning in these <b>Hadiths</b> restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement, <b> <br />فَهَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيًّا <br /></b> (So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me, <br /> <br />inheritance of Prophethood. <br /> <br />For this reason Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيَرِثُ مِنْ الِ يَعْقُوبَ <br /> <br />and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqub. <br /> <br />This is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ <br /> <br />And Suleiman inherited from Dawud. (27&#59;16) <br /> <br />This means that he inherited Prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth. It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father. Therefore, if this was not referring to a specific type of inheritance, then Allah would not have mentioned it. <br /> <br />All of this is supported and affirmed by what is in the authentic <b>Hadith</b>&#59; <br /> <br />نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة <br /> <br />We Prophets do not leave behind any inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity. <br /> <br />Mujahid said concerning his statement, <b> <br />يَرِثُنِي <br /> <br />وَيَرِثُ مِنْ الِ يَعْقُوبَ <br /></b> (Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqub). <br /> <br />&#34;His inheritance was knowledge, and Zakariyya was one of the descendants of Yaqub.&#34; <br /> <br />Hushaym said, that Ismail bin Abi Khalid informed us that Abu Salih commented about the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;<b> <br />يَرِثُنِي <br /> <br />وَيَرِثُ مِنْ الِ يَعْقُوبَ <br /></b> (who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqub), <br /> <br />&#34;He would be a Prophet like his forefathers were Prophets.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased! <br /> <br />means &#34;Make him pleasing to You (Allah) and your creation. Love him and make him beloved to your creatures, in both his religion and his character.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 5" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 7" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
