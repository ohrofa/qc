Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs <b>Al Imran</b> and <b>Al-Anbiya'</b>. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرْ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ <br /> <br />And mention in the Book, Maryam, <br /> <br />She was Maryam bint Imran from the family lineage of Dawud. She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel. Allah mentioned the story of her mother's pregnancy with her in Surah <b>Al Imran</b>, and that she (Maryam's mother) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah. This meant that she dedicated the child (Maryam) to the service of the <b>Masjid</b> of the Sacred House (in Jerusalem). Thus, they (Zakariyya, Maryam's mother and Maryam) were similar in that aspect. <br /> <br />فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا <br /> <br /> <br />So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner. (3&#59;37) <br /> <br />Thus, Maryam was raised among the Children of Israel in an honorable way. She was one of the female worshippers, well-known for her remarkable acts of worship, devotion and perseverance. She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time. He was a great man among them, whom they would refer to in their religious matters. Zakariyya saw astonishing miracles occur from her that amazed him. <br /> <br />كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا <br /> <br />قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَأءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ <br /> <br />Every time Zakariyya entered the <b>Mihrab</b> to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said&#59;&#34;O Maryam! From where have you got this!&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;This is from Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Verily, Allah provides to whom He wills, without limit. (3&#59;37) <br /> <br />It has been mentioned that he would find her with winter fruit during the summer and summer fruit during the winter. This has already been explained in Surah <b>Al Imran</b>. Then, when Allah wanted to grant her His servant and Messenger, `Isa, one of the five Great Messengers. <br /> <br />إِذِ انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَانًا شَرْقِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east. <br /> <br />This means that she withdrew from them and secluded herself from them. She went to the eastern side of the Sacred <b>Masjid</b> (in Jerusalem). <br /> <br />It is reported from Ibn Abbas that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Verily, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah's creation of why the Christians took the east as the direction of devotional worship. They did because of Allah's statement, <b> <br />إِذِ انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَانًا شَرْقِيًّا <br /></b> (When she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east), Therefore, they took the birthplace of `Isa as their direction of worship.&#34; <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 15" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>16</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 17" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
