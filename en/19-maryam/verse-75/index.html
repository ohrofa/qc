This is a challenge against the idolators who claim that they were following guidance in what they were doing. <br /> <br />This is similar to the challenge that Allah mentions about the Jews when He says, <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ إِن زَعمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَأءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ <br /> <br />O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other people, then long for death if you are truthful. (62&#59;6) <br /> <br />Meaning, `Supplicate for death to come to those who are following falsehood among us if you truly claim to be upon the truth. If you are true, then this supplication will not harm you.' But they refused to do so. An extensive discussion of this has already preceded in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>, and to Allah is the praise. <br /> <br />Likewise, Allah mentioned the challenge that was given to the Christians in Surah <b>Al Imran</b>, when they were persistent in their disbelief and continued in their transgression. They refused to give up their exaggerating claim that `Isa was the son of Allah. Therefore, Allah mentioned His arguments and proofs against the worship of `Isa, and that he was merely a creature like Adam. <br /> <br />After this, Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَنْ حَأجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَأءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَأءَنَا وَأَبْنَأءَكُمْ وَنِسَأءَنَا وَنِسَأءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ <br /> <br />Then whoever disputes with you about him after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say&#59;&#34;Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the curse of Allah upon those who lie.&#34; (3&#59;61) <br /> <br />However, they (the Christians) also retreated from this challenge</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 74" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">75</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>75</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 76" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-76/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
