Indeed His promise, that is to say, that which He promises, is ever fulfilled, meaning that it always arrives (the original [form of ma'tiyyan] is ma'tyun); or [what is meant by] His promise here is Paradise, to which those deserving of it shall arrive.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Description of the Gardens of the Truthful and Those Who repent</b> <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, says; <br /> <br />جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدَ الرَّحْمَنُ عِبَادَهُ بِالْغَيْبِ <br /> <br />They will enter <b>`Adn</b> Gardens which the Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the unseen. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, says that the Gardens (of Paradise), which the penitent will enter, will be Gardens of <b>`Adn</b>, meaning, eternity. <br /> <br />These are Gardens that the Most Beneficent promises His servants in the unseen. <br /> <br />This means that these Gardens are from the unseen things that they believe in, even though they have never witnessed them. They believe in the unseen out of their strong conviction and the strength of their faith. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيًّا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, His promise must come to pass. <br /> <br />This affirms the fact that this will occur, and that it is a settled matter. Allah does not break His promise, nor does He change it. <br /> <br />This is similar to His statement, <br /> <br />كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />His promise is certainly to be accomplished. (73&#59;18) <br /> <br />This means that His promise will be and there is no avoiding it. <br /> <br />Allah's statement here, <br />مَأْتِيًّا <br /> (must come to pass), <br /> <br />This means that it will come to His servants who are striving towards it and they will reach it. <br /> <br />There are those commentators who said, <br />مَأْتِيًّا <br /> (must come to pass), <br /> <br />&#34;This means it is coming, because everything that comes to you, you also come to it. <br /> <br />This is as the Arabs say, `Fifty years came to me, and I came to fifty years.' They both mean the same thing (I'm fifty years old).&#34; <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 60" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> مريم<span class="num-ar">19</span> :<span class="num-ar">61</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Maryam<span> 19</span>:<span>61</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Maryam Verse 62" href="/en/19-maryam/verse-62/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
