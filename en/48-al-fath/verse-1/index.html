This is when the idolators prevented him from reaching <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> to perform the <b>Umrah</b> he intended. <br /> <br />They stopped the Prophet from reaching Makkah at that time, but then were prone to peace negotiations. A peace treaty was conducted stipulating that the Messenger would return this year and then come back for <b>Umrah</b> the following year. The Messenger agreed. However, some of the Companions disliked these terms, including Umar bin Al-Khattab, as we will mention in detail, Allah willing, while explaining this <b>Surah</b>. <br /> <br />After the Prophet slaughtered his sacrificial animals in the area where he was stopped and headed back to Al-Madinah, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this <b>Surah</b> about what occurred between him and the idolators. <br /> <br />Allah declared the <b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b> peace treaty a manifest victory, because of the benefits peace would carry and the good results that did originate from it. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud and other Companions said, <br /> <br />&#34;You consider the conquering of Makkah to be <b>Al-Fath</b> (the victory), while to us, <b>Al-Fath</b> is the treaty conducted at <b>Al-Hلudaybiyyah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Jabir bin Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;We only considered <b>Al-Fath</b> to be the day of <b>Hudaybiyyah</b>!&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara (bin Azib) said, <br /> <br />&#34;You consider <b>Al-Fath</b> to be the conquest of Makkah, which was indeed a victory. However, we consider <b>Al-Fath</b> to be the pledge of <b>Ar-Ridwan</b> on the Day of <b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b>. Then, we were fourteen hundred with the Messenger of Allah. <br /><b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b> had a well, whose water we consumed, not leaving a drop of water in it. When the news of what happened reached the Messenger of Allah, he came towards us and sat on the edge of the well. Then he asked to be brought a bucket of water and used it for ablution. He next rinsed his mouth, invoked Allah and poured that water into the well. Soon after, that well provided us, as well as our animals, with sufficient water, in whatever amount of water we wished.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were with the Messenger of Allah on a trip, and I asked him about a matter three times, but he did not answer me. So I said to myself, `May your mother lose you, O son of Al-Khattab! You were stubborn in repeating your question three times to the Messenger of Allah; each time he did not respond to you.' So I mounted my animal, my camel, and went ahead for fear that a part of the Qur'an might be revealed in my case. Suddenly, I heard a caller calling, `O Umar!' So, I went to the Messenger while fearing that part of the Qur'an was revealed about me. The Prophet said, <br /> <br />نَزَلَ عَلَيَّ الْبَارِحَةَ سُورَةٌ هِيَ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا <br /> <br />Last night, a Surah was revealed to me that is dearer to me than this life and all that it contains&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُّبِينًا <br /> <br />لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ <br /> <br />Verily, We have given you a manifest victory. That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith from several chains of narration through Malik, may Allah grant him His mercy. <br /> <br />Ali bin Al-Madini commented, <br /> <br />&#34;This is a good chain of narration consisting of the scholars of Al-Madinah.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;This Ayah was revealed to the Prophet, <br />لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ <br /> (That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future), on his return from <b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b>. The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَقَدْ أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَيَّ اللَّيْلَةَ ايَةٌ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا عَلَى الاَْرْض <br /> <br />Tonight, an Ayah, that is dearer to me than all that the earth carries, was revealed to me. <br /> <br />The Prophet recited the Ayah to them. They said, <br /> <br />`Congratulations, O Allah's Messenger! Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has stated what He will do with you. So what will He do with us?' <br /> <br />These Ayat were revealed to the Prophet, <br /> <br />لِيُدْخِلَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ وَالْمُوْمِنَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاَْنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />وَيُكَفِّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّيَاتِهِمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عِندَ اللَّهِ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br />That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow to abide therein forever. and He may expiate from them their sins; and that is with Allah supreme success. <br /> <br />This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shubah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet used to pray until both his feet were swollen. He was asked, `Has not Allah forgiven you all your sins of the past and of future?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَفَلَ أَكُونُ عَبْدًا شَكُورًا <br /> <br />Should I not be a thankful servant?&#34; <br /> <br />The two collectors of the Sahihs collected this Hadith, as well as, the rest of the Group, except Abu Dawud. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُّبِينًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, We have given you a manifest victory. <br /> <br />means, clear and apparent victory. <br /> <br />This Ayah is about the treaty at <b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b>, which resulted in great goodness, including people embracing Islam in large crowds and having the chance to meet each other openly. During that time, the believers preached to the idolators and thus beneficial knowledge and faith spread all around. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>1</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 2" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
