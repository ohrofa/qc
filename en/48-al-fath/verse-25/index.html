If it had not been for the believing men and believing women (who lived in Makkah and) whom you did not know, and had there not been the fear that you might trample on them and unwittingly incur blame on their account, (then fighting would not have been put to a stop.

And if it had not been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment.</p></div><div id="sarwar"><h3><span>18</span> Muhammad Sarwar</h3><p>It was the disbelievers who kept you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your sacrificial offering from reaching its proper place. God would not have kept you from fighting the disbelievers, had there not been believing men and women (among them) whom you did not know and whom you might have unknowingly harmed. God did this because He grants mercy to whomever He wants. Had they been distinguishable from the believers, We would certainly have punished them with a painful torment.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>They are those who disbelieved and barred you from the Holy Mosque and the offering detained so as not to reach its place of sacrifice if it had not been for certain believing men and certain believing women whom you did not know, you might have trampled upon them, and so sin reached you because of (killing) them while you did not know. In order that Allah admits into His Mercy whom He will, had they (the believers) been easy to distinguish, We would have punished the unbelievers among them with a painful punishment.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>They are those who disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram and detained the sacrificial animals, from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills -- if they had been apart, We verily, would have punished with painful torment those of them who disbelieved.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>It was they who were bent on denying the truth, and who debarred you from the Sacred Mosque and who prevented your offering from reaching its place of sacrifice. And had it not been for the believing men and believing women [in Makkah] whom you might unwittingly have trampled underfoot, and on whose account you might have, unknowingly, become guilty, [God would have commanded you to fight it out with them; but He ordained it thus] so that He may bring whoever He will into His mercy. If they [the believers] had been clearly separated, We would have punished those who were bent on denying the truth with a painful punishment.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>It is they who disbelieved, and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the offering from reaching its destination. Were it not for faithful men and faithful women, whom you did not know, you were about to hurt them, and became guilty of an unintentional crime. Thus God admits into His mercy whomever He wills. Had they dispersed, We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with a painful penalty.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, that is, [barred you] from reaching it, and [prevented] the offering (wa'l-hadya is a supplement to the [suffixed pronoun] �kum, `you' [of saddkum, `they barred you']), which was detained (ma`kfan is a circumstantial qualifier), from reaching its destination, that is, [from] the place at which it is customarily sacrificed, namely, the Sanctuary [itself] (an yablugha mahillahu, is an inclusive substitution). And were it not for [some of] the believing men and believing women, being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers, whom you did not know, to be believers -- lest you should trample them, that is to say, [lest] you should slay them together with the disbelievers, had you been given permission to embark on the conquest (an tata'hum is an inclusive substitution for �hum, `them' [of lam ta`lamhum, `whom you did not know']), and thus incur sin on account of them without, your, knowing, it ... (the third person pronouns in both groups [of people] predominantly imply males; the response to lawl, `were it not', has been omitted [through ellipsis], being [something along the lines of] la-udhina lakum f'l-fathi, `you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest'), but permission for this was not given at the time, so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will, such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated, [had] they [the believers] been distinguishable from the disbelievers, We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them, of the people of Mecca [immediately] thereat, by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof, with a painful chastisement.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Some of the Benefits gained from the Treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted states that the Arab idolators from Quraysh and their allies who extended help to them against His Messenger, <br /> <br />هُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا <br /> <br />They are those who disbelieved, <br /> <br />i.e. they are indeed the disbelievers, <br /> <br />وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> <br />and hindered you from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, <br /> <br />i.e. `even though you are its people and more worthy of being responsible for it,' <br /> <br />وَالْهَدْيَ مَعْكُوفًا أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ <br /> <br />and detained the sacrificial animals, from reaching their place of sacrifice. <br /> <br />i.e. they prevented, because of transgression and stubbornness, the sacrificial animals from being reached to the place where they would be slaughtered. There were seventy sacrificial camels designated for sacrifice, as we will mention, Allah willing. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّوْمِنُونَ وَنِسَاء مُّوْمِنَاتٌ <br /> <br />Had there not been believing men and believing women, <br /> <br />i.e. `living among the Makkans hiding their faith for fearing for their safety from the pagans.
