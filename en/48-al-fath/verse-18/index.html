We mentioned the number of these believers as being one thousand and four hundred and that the tree was a <b>Samurah</b> tree, located in the area of <b>Hudaybiyyah</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari narrated from Tariq that Abdur-Rahman said, <br /> <br />&#34;I went on <b>Hajj</b> and passed by people praying and asked, `What is this <b>Masjid</b>' <br /> <br />They said, `This is the tree where the Messenger of Allah took the pledge of <b>Ar-Ridwan</b>.' <br /> <br />So, I went to Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and told him. Sa`id said, <br /> <br />`My father told me that he was among those who gave their pledge to the Messenger of Allah under the tree. My father said&#59; <br /> <br />The following year, when we went out, we forgot its place and could not agree which tree it was.' <br /> <br />Sa`id said, `The Companions of Muhammad forgot where the tree was, but you know where it is. Therefore, you have better knowledge than them!&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ <br /> <br />He knew what was in their hearts, <br /> <br />meaning, of truthfulness, trustworthiness, obedience and adherence, <br /> <br />فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ <br /> <br />and He sent down <b>As-Sakinah</b>, (calmness and tranquility), <br /> <br />عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory. <br /> <br />i.e. in reference to the goodness that Allah the Exalted and Most Honored caused to happened to the Companions on account of the peace treaty between them and their disbelieving enemies. Ever after that, the Companions gained abundant, general and continuous benefits and accomplishments, leading to the conquest of Khyber and Makkah and then the various surrounding provinces and areas. They earned tremendous glory, triumphs and an elevated and honorable status in this life and in the Hereafter, just as Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />وَمَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً يَأْخُذُونَهَا وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Fath Verse 17" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">18</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>18</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Fath Verse 19" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=48,sura_dir="al-fath",count_ayat=29,number_aya=18;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
