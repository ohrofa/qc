However, Allah will make them within your reach and indeed He compasses all these victories for your benefit. <br /> <br />Surely, Allah the Exalted provides provisions and sustenance for His servants who have <b>Taqwa</b>, from resources they could never imagine. <br /> <br />Scholars of Tafsir differ over the reference to other war spoils mentioned here. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said that it refers to the conquest of Khyber. <br /> <br />This meaning is sound according to the Ayah, <br />فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَذِهِ <br /> (and He has hastened for you this), which refers to the treaty of <b>Al-Hudaybiyyah</b>. <br /> <br />This is view of Ad-Dahhak, Muhammad bin Ishaq and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that this part of the Ayah refers to the conquest of Makkah, and this opinion was preferred by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Layla and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it refers to victories over the Persians and the Romans, while Mujahid said that it refers to every victory and all spoils of war, until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Ibn Abbas commented on the Ayah, <br />وَأُخْرَى لَمْ تَقْدِرُوا عَلَيْهَا قَدْ أَحَاطَ اللَّهُ بِهَا <br /> (And other (victories) which are not yet within your power; indeed Allah compasses them), <br /> <br />&#34;They are the victories that are continuing until this day.&#34; <br /><b>Had Makkah's Disbelievers fought at Al-Hudaybiyyah, They would have retreated in Defeat</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ قَاتَلَكُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوَلَّوُا الاَْدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُونَ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 20" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>21</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 22" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=48,sura_dir="al-fath",count_ayat=29,number_aya=21;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
