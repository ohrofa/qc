When their hearts felt content with acceptance and were at peace, Allah increased their faith, joining it to the faith they already had. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, and other Imams, relied on this Ayah as proof that faith increases and decreases in the hearts. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said next that had He willed, He would have inflicted defeat on the disbelievers, Allah says; <br /> <br />وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ <br /> <br />And to Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth, <br /> <br />and had He willed to send only one angel to them, that angel would have brought destruction to all what they had. However, Allah the Exalted willed <b>Jihad</b> and fighting to be established for, and by, the believers for great wisdom, clear reasons and unequivocal evidences that He had in all this. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Great said next, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 3" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 5" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
