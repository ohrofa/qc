You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their sign is in their faces from the effect of prostration [i.e., prayer]. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers – so that He [i.e., Allah] may enrage by them the disbelievers.

This is their description in Torah; and their description in Injīl is&#58; like a sown crop that brings forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem, looking good to the farmers, so that He may enrage the disbelievers through them.

(9&#59;123) <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَثَلُ الْمُوْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ الْجَسَدِ الْوَاحِدِ إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَايِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالْحُمَّى وَالسَّهَر <br /> <br />The parable of the believers in their kindness and mercy for each other, is that of the body&#59;when one of its organs falls ill, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness. <br /> <br />The Prophet also said, <br /> <br />الْمُوْمِنُ لِلْمُوْمِنِ كَالْبُنْيَانِ يَشُدُّ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا <br /> <br />A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other. <br /> <br />Then he clasped his hands with his fingers interlaced. <br /> <br />Both of these Hadiths were collected in the Sahih. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> <br />You see them bowing and falling down prostrate, seeking reward from Allah and acceptance. <br /> <br />Allah describes the believers as active in performing righteous deeds and in praying, which is the best action there is, all the while being sincere to Allah the Exalted and Most Honored in the prayer, awaiting His generous reward alone. <br /> <br />Allah's best reward is Paradise that contains His bounties and favors, abundant provisions, as well as, earning His good pleasure that is greater than the former reward. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ <br /> <br />But the greatest bliss is the acceptance by Allah. (9&#59;72) <br /> <br />The statement of Allah the Exalted next, <br /> <br />سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ <br /> <br />The mark of them is on their faces from the traces of prostration. <br /> <br />refers to graceful appearance, according to Ibn Abbas as reported from him by Ali bin Abi Talhah. <br /> <br />Mujahid and several others explained&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It means, humbleness and reverence.&#34; <br /> <br />Some said, <br /> <br />&#34;The righteous good deed brings light to the heart, brightness to the face, ampleness in provisions, and love in people's hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />The Leader of the faithful, Uthman bin Affan said, <br /> <br />&#34;Everyone who hides a secret, then Allah the Exalted will either show on his face what he's done or by the words that accidentally slip from his mouth.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Abbas said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الْهَدْيَ الصَّالِحَ وَالسَّمْتَ الصَّالِحَ وَالاْقْتِصَادَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة <br /> <br />Verily, good conduct, graceful appearance and moderation are one part out of twenty-five parts of Prophethood. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Therefore, since the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, had sincere intentions and righteous good deeds, all those who looked at them liked their appearance and conduct. <br /> <br />Imam Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was told that when the Christians saw the Companions, who conquered Ash-Sham, they commented, <br /> <br />`These people are, by Allah, better than the Disciples (of <b>`Isa</b>) according to what has been conveyed to us.&#34;' <br /> <br />They indeed said the truth, for this <b>Ummah</b> was mentioned in an honorable way in previously revealed Scriptures. The best and most honored members of this <b>Ummah</b> are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, praised them in previous Books and Revelations, and this is why He said here, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ <br /> <br />This is their description in the <b>Tawrah</b>, <br /> <br />then said, <br /> <br />وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الاِْنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ <br /> <br />But their description in the <b>Injil</b> is like a seed which sends forth its shoot (<b>Shat`ah</b>) (its shoot or branch), <br /> <br />فَأزَرَهُ <br /> <br />then makes it strong, (able to stand on its own), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَغْلَظَ <br /> <br />and becomes thick, (youthful and long), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَوَى عَلَى سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ <br /> <br />and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, <br /> <br />Such is the parable that describes the Companions of Allah's Messenger. They gave the Messenger aid, support and victory, just as the shoot hardens the plant, <br /> <br />لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ <br /> <br />that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. <br /> <br />Relying on this Ayah, Imam Malik stated that the <b>Rawafid</b> are disbelievers because they hate the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. <br /> <br />Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Companions enrage them, and according to this Ayah, he who is enraged by the Companions is a disbeliever.&#34; <br /> <br />Several scholars agreed with Malik's opinion, may Allah be pleased with them. <br /> <br />There are numerous Hadiths mentioning the virtues of the Companions and prohibiting the criticism on their mistakes. It is sufficient that Allah the Exalted has praised them and declared that He is pleased with them. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً <br /> <br />Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds, forgiveness, (for their sins), <br /> <br />وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and a mighty reward. <br /> <br />a generous reward and honorable provisions. <br /> <br />Certainly, Allah's promise is true and shall come to pass and will never be broken or changed. Surely, all those who follow the guidance of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, will be similar to them. However, the Companions have the better virtue, the obvious lead and the perfection in character, on account of which none among this <b>Ummah</b> will be able to attain their level. May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased. May He place them in the gardens of <b>Al-Firdaws</b>, and make it their abode, and He indeed has done all of that. <br /> <br />In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ أَنْفَقَ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا مَا أَدْرَكَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَاا نَصِيفَه <br /> <br />Do not abuse my Companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you spends the amount of <b>Uhud</b> in gold, that amount will never reach the level of one of them spending a <b>Mudd</b> half of it. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Fath</b>; all praise and thanks is due to Allah</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Fath Verse 28" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=48,sura_dir="al-fath",count_ayat=29,number_aya=29;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
