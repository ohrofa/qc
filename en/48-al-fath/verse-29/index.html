Their distinctive indication is (apparent) on their faces from the illuminous traces of (their) prostration. Such is the description (of these attributes of theirs) in the Torah, and their description in the Evangel is that they (will be) like a seed-produce that sends forth its sprout, then makes it strong. It then becomes stout and stands firm on its stem giving delight to the sowers; (Allâh will in a similar way raise the believers from strength to strength) with the result that He may make the disbelievers suffer an impotent rage because of them.

The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, it then becomes thick, and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.

You see them occupied in bowing and prostrating and in seeking Allah's bounty and good pleasure. They are distinguished from others by the marks of prostration on their faces. Thus are they described in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a tilth that puts forth its shoot, then strengthens it so that it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem.

You see them bowing and prostrating [in worship], seeking Allah’s grace, and [His] pleasure. Their mark is [visible] on their faces, from the effect of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah and their description in the Evangel. Like a tillage that sends out its shoots and builds them up, and they grow stout and settle on their stalks, impressing the sowers, so that He may enrage the faithless by them. Allah has promised those of them who have faith and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3>Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Those who are with him are harsh against the unbelievers but merciful to one another. You see them bow andprostrate themselves seeking the bounty and pleasure of Allah. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel, as the seed which puts forth its shoot and strengthens it, so that it grows stout and rises straight upon its stalk, delighting the sowers, and through them He enrages the unbelievers. Allah has promised those of them who believe and do good deeds, forgiveness and a great wage.</p></div><div id="sarwar"><h3>Muhammad Sarwar</h3><p>Muhammad is the Messenger of God and those with him are stern to the disbelievers yet kind among themselves. You can see them bowing and prostrating before God, seeking His favors and pleasure. Their faces (foreheads) are marked due to the effect of their frequent prostrations. That is their description in the Torah and in the Gospel they are mentioned as the seed which shoots out its stalk then becomes stronger, harder and stands firm on its stumps, attracting the farmers. Thus, God has described the believers to enrage the disbelievers. God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to the righteously striving believers.</p></div><div id="shakir"><h3>Mohammad Habib Shakir</h3><p>Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from Allah and pleasure; their marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration; that is their description in the Taurat and their description in the Injeel; like as seed-produce that puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, so it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them; Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good, forgiveness and a great reward.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3>Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Those who are with him are firm and unyielding towards those who deny the truth, but compassionate towards one another. You see them bowing and prostrating themselves, seeking the grace of God and His good will. Their marks are on their faces, the traces of their prostrations; they are described in the Torah and in the Gospel as being like a seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands firm on its own stem, delighting the sowers. He seeks to enrage the disbelievers through them. God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believe and do good works.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3>Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is&#59; like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Muhammad (the subject) is the Messenger of God (its predicate) and those who are with him, that is, his Companions from among the believers (wa'lladhna ma`ahu, [another] subject, the predicate of which [is the following, ashidd'u]) are hard, tough, against the disbelievers, showing them no mercy [but], merciful among themselves (ruham'u is a second predicate [of wa'lladhna ma`ahu, `and those who are with him']), that is to say, they show mutual sympathy and affection for one another, much like a father and a son. You see, you observe, them bowing, prostrating [in worship] (both rukka`an and sujjadan are circumstantial qualifiers). They seek (yabtaghna is the beginning of a new sentence) bounty from God and beatitude. Their mark (smhum is a subject), their distinguishing feature, is on their faces (f wujhihim is its predicate)&#59; this is a light and a radiance by which, in the Hereafter, they will be recognised as having been those who used to prostrate in this world, from the effect of prostration (min athari'l-sujdi is semantically connected to the same thing to which the predicate is semantically connected, that is to say, k'inatan, `[this] being [from the effect of prostration]'; syntactically, it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of k'inatan], which is also the subject of the predicate [sc. wujhihim, `their faces']). That, mentioned description, is their description (mathaluhum is the subject) in the Torah (f'l-tawrti is the predicate thereof); and their description in the Gospel (wa-mathaluhum f'l-injli, is a subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]) is as a seed that sends forth its shoot (read shat'ahu or shata'ahu) and strengthens it (read zarahu or azarahu), nourishing it and assisting it, and it grows stout and rises firmly, becoming strong and upright, upon its stalk, its roots (sq is the plural of sq), delighting the sowers, that is to say those who planted it, on account of its fairness. The Companions, may God be pleased with them, are being described in this way, for at the outset they were weak and very few in number; but then their number grew and they acquired strength in the most wholesome way, so that He may enrage the disbelievers by them (li-yaghza bihimu'l-kuffra is semantically connected to an omitted clause, which is suggested by what preceded, that is to say, `they are likened to this [so that God may enrage the disbelievers]'). God has promised those of them who believe and perform righteous deeds, the Companions (minhum, `of them'&#59; min, `of', is an indicator of the genus and not partitive, for they are all possessed of the mentioned attributes) forgiveness and a great reward -- Paradise. Both of these [rewards] will also be given to those who will come after them, as is stated in other verses. Meccan, consisting of 18 verses.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Qualities of the Faithful Believers and Their Refinement</b> <br /> <br />Allah declares that without doubt, Muhammad is truly His Messenger, <br /> <br />مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. (and this quality includes every beautiful description). <br /> <br />Allah praises the Companions of the Messenger, may Allah be pleased with them all, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاء عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاء بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, merciful among themselves. <br /> <br />just as He, the Exalted and Most Honored, said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ <br /> <br />Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers. (5&#59;54) <br /> <br />This is the description of the believers; harsh with the disbelievers, merciful and kind to the believers, angry without smiling before the disbelievers, smiling and beaming with pleasure before his believing brother. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />يَأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ الْكُفَّارِ وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً <br /> <br />O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you. (9&#59;123) <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَثَلُ الْمُوْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ الْجَسَدِ الْوَاحِدِ إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَايِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالْحُمَّى وَالسَّهَر <br /> <br />The parable of the believers in their kindness and mercy for each other, is that of the body&#59;when one of its organs falls ill, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness. <br /> <br />The Prophet also said, <br /> <br />الْمُوْمِنُ لِلْمُوْمِنِ كَالْبُنْيَانِ يَشُدُّ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا <br /> <br />A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other. <br /> <br />Then he clasped his hands with his fingers interlaced. <br /> <br />Both of these Hadiths were collected in the Sahih. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> <br />You see them bowing and falling down prostrate, seeking reward from Allah and acceptance. <br /> <br />Allah describes the believers as active in performing righteous deeds and in praying, which is the best action there is, all the while being sincere to Allah the Exalted and Most Honored in the prayer, awaiting His generous reward alone. <br /> <br />Allah's best reward is Paradise that contains His bounties and favors, abundant provisions, as well as, earning His good pleasure that is greater than the former reward. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ <br /> <br />But the greatest bliss is the acceptance by Allah. (9&#59;72) <br /> <br />The statement of Allah the Exalted next, <br /> <br />سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ <br /> <br />The mark of them is on their faces from the traces of prostration. <br /> <br />refers to graceful appearance, according to Ibn Abbas as reported from him by Ali bin Abi Talhah. <br /> <br />Mujahid and several others explained&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It means, humbleness and reverence.&#34; <br /> <br />Some said, <br /> <br />&#34;The righteous good deed brings light to the heart, brightness to the face, ampleness in provisions, and love in people's hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />The Leader of the faithful, Uthman bin Affan said, <br /> <br />&#34;Everyone who hides a secret, then Allah the Exalted will either show on his face what he's done or by the words that accidentally slip from his mouth.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Abbas said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الْهَدْيَ الصَّالِحَ وَالسَّمْتَ الصَّالِحَ وَالاْقْتِصَادَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة <br /> <br />Verily, good conduct, graceful appearance and moderation are one part out of twenty-five parts of Prophethood. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Therefore, since the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, had sincere intentions and righteous good deeds, all those who looked at them liked their appearance and conduct. <br /> <br />Imam Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was told that when the Christians saw the Companions, who conquered Ash-Sham, they commented, <br /> <br />`These people are, by Allah, better than the Disciples (of <b>`Isa</b>) according to what has been conveyed to us.&#34;' <br /> <br />They indeed said the truth, for this <b>Ummah</b> was mentioned in an honorable way in previously revealed Scriptures. The best and most honored members of this <b>Ummah</b> are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, praised them in previous Books and Revelations, and this is why He said here, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ <br /> <br />This is their description in the <b>Tawrah</b>, <br /> <br />then said, <br /> <br />وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الاِْنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ <br /> <br />But their description in the <b>Injil</b> is like a seed which sends forth its shoot (<b>Shat`ah</b>) (its shoot or branch), <br /> <br />فَأزَرَهُ <br /> <br />then makes it strong, (able to stand on its own), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَغْلَظَ <br /> <br />and becomes thick, (youthful and long), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَوَى عَلَى سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ <br /> <br />and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, <br /> <br />Such is the parable that describes the Companions of Allah's Messenger. They gave the Messenger aid, support and victory, just as the shoot hardens the plant, <br /> <br />لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ <br /> <br />that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. <br /> <br />Relying on this Ayah, Imam Malik stated that the <b>Rawafid</b> are disbelievers because they hate the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. <br /> <br />Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Companions enrage them, and according to this Ayah, he who is enraged by the Companions is a disbeliever.&#34; <br /> <br />Several scholars agreed with Malik's opinion, may Allah be pleased with them. <br /> <br />There are numerous Hadiths mentioning the virtues of the Companions and prohibiting the criticism on their mistakes. It is sufficient that Allah the Exalted has praised them and declared that He is pleased with them. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً <br /> <br />Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds, forgiveness, (for their sins), <br /> <br />وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and a mighty reward. <br /> <br />a generous reward and honorable provisions. <br /> <br />Certainly, Allah's promise is true and shall come to pass and will never be broken or changed. Surely, all those who follow the guidance of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, will be similar to them. However, the Companions have the better virtue, the obvious lead and the perfection in character, on account of which none among this <b>Ummah</b> will be able to attain their level. May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased. May He place them in the gardens of <b>Al-Firdaws</b>, and make it their abode, and He indeed has done all of that. <br /> <br />In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ أَنْفَقَ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا مَا أَدْرَكَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَاا نَصِيفَه <br /> <br />Do not abuse my Companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you spends the amount of <b>Uhud</b> in gold, that amount will never reach the level of one of them spending a <b>Mudd</b> half of it. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Fath</b>; all praise and thanks is due to Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Fath Verse 28" href="/en/48-al-fath/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفتح<span class="num-ar">48</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fath<span> 48</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
