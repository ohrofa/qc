(43&#59;32) <br /> <br />And Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />قُل لَّوْ أَنتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَايِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّى إِذًا لامْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ الاِنفَاقِ <br /> <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely hold back for fear of spending it.&#34; (17&#59;100) <br /> <br />أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذاً لاَّ يُوْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيراً <br /> <br />Or have they a share in the dominion! Then in that case they would not give mankind even a <b>Naqir</b>. (4&#59;53) <br /> <br />All of this goes to show how incapable mankind is and how divergent and inconsistent their ideas and desires are. Only Allah, may He be glorified, is Perfect in all His attributes, words, actions, laws, power and control of His creation, may He be exalted and sanctified. There is no God but He and no Lord besides Him. <br /> <br />Then He says&#59; <br /> <br />بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُم بِذِكْرِهِمْ <br /> <br />Nay, We have brought them their reminder, <br /> <br />meaning the Qur'an, <br /> <br />فَهُمْ عَن ذِكْرِهِم مُّعْرِضُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but they turn away from their reminder. <br /><b>The Prophet does not ask for any payment, and he calls to the straight path</b> <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;minoon Verse 70" href="/en/23-al-mu-minoon/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المؤمنون<span class="num-ar">23</span> :<span class="num-ar">71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mu'minun<span> 23</span>:<span>71</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;minoon Verse 72" href="/en/23-al-mu-minoon/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
