According to the story God, exalted be He, gathered all the beasts of prey and the birds and other [animals] for Noah. As he [Noah] pushed forth his hands into each species, his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female, whereafter he would take them on board the ship (a variant reading [for min kuli, `of every'] is min kullin, `of every [kind]', in which case zawjayni, `[two] mates', becomes a direct object, with ithnayn, `two', [being repeated] for emphasis thereof); together with your family -- his wife [?] and children -- except for those against whom the Word has already gone forth, that they be destroyed, namely, his wife and his son Canaan (Kan`n), unlike Shem (Sm), Ham (Hm) and Japheth (Yfith) whom, together with their three wives, he carried on board. In srat Hd [the following is mentioned where Noah is told who he should carry in the ship]&#59; `... and those who believe.' And none believed with him except a few [Q. 11&#59;40]. It is said that these were six men and their wives. Moreover it is said that all those who were on the ship numbered seventy eight, half of them were men and half were women. And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong, those who have disbelieved, that I should refrain from destroying them. They shall indeed be drowned.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِ أَنِ اصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا فَإِذَا جَاء أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ التَّنُّورُ فَاسْلُكْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ <br /> <br />So, We revealed to him&#59;&#34;Construct the ship under Our Eyes and under Our revelation. Then, when Our command comes, and (water) gushes forth from the oven, take on board of each kind two, and your family, <br /> <br />At that point, Allah commanded him to build a boat and to make it strong and firm, and to carry therein of every kind two, i.e., a male and a female of every species of animals, plants and fruits etc. He was also to carry his family, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَوْلُ مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br />except those thereof against whom the Word has already gone forth. <br /> <br />meaning, those whom Allah had already decreed were to be destroyed. These were the members of his family who did not believe in him, such as his son and his wife. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />وَلَا تُخَاطِبْنِي فِي الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا إِنَّهُم مُّغْرَقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And address Me not in favor of those who have done wrong. Verily, they are to be drowned. <br /> <br />means, `when you witness the heavy rain falling, do not let yourself be overcome with compassion and pity for your people, or hope for more time for them so that they may believe, for I have decreed that they will be drowned and will die in their state of disbelief and wrongdoing.' <br /> <br />The story has already been told in detail in Surah <b>Hud</b>, and there is no need to repeat it here</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;minoon Verse 26" href="/en/23-al-mu-minoon/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المؤمنون<span class="num-ar">23</span> :<span class="num-ar">27</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mu'minun<span> 23</span>:<span>27</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;minoon Verse 28" href="/en/23-al-mu-minoon/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=23,sura_dir="al-mu-minoon",count_ayat=118,number_aya=27;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
