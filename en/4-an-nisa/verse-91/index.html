However, the intention of each type is different, for the latter are hypocrites. They pretend to be Muslims with the Prophet and his Companions, so that they could attain safety with the Muslims for their blood, property and families. However, they support the idolators in secret and worship what they worship, so that they are at peace with them also. These people have secretly sided with the idolators, just as Allah described them, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَى شَيَـطِينِهِمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ <br /> <br />But when they are alone with their <b>Shayatin</b>, they say&#59;&#34;Truly, we are with you.&#34; (2&#59;14) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلَّ مَا رُدُّوَاْ إِلَى الْفِتْنِةِ أُرْكِسُواْ فِيِهَا <br /> <br />Every time they are sent back to <b>Fitnah</b>, they yield thereto. <br /> <br />meaning, they dwell in <b>Fitnah</b>. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Fitnah</b> mentioned here refers to <b>Shirk</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Mujahid said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about a group from Makkah who used to go to the Prophet (in Al-Madinah) pretending to be Muslims. However, when they went back to Quraysh, they reverted to worshipping idols. They wanted to be at peace with both sides. Allah commanded they should be fought against, unless they withdraw from combat and resort to peace. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِن لَّمْ يَعْتَزِلُوكُمْ وَيُلْقُواْ إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَمَ <br /> <br />If they withdraw not from you, nor offer you peace, <br /> <br />meaning, revert to peaceful and complacent behavior. <br /> <br />وَيَكُفُّوَاْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ <br /> <br />nor restrain their hands, <br /> <br />refrain from fighting you, <br /> <br />فَخُذُوهُمْ <br /> <br />take (hold of) them, <br /> <br />capture them. <br /> <br />وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثِقِفْتُمُوهُمْ <br /> <br />and kill them wherever you <b>Thaqiftumuhum</b>. <br /> <br />wherever you find them. <br /> <br />وَأُوْلَـيِكُمْ جَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانًا مُّبِينًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In their case, We have provided you with a clear warrant against them, <br /> <br />meaning an unequivocal and plain warrant</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 90" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>91</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 92" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=91;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
