[They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take [secret] lovers.

God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry. They are women (seeking) wedlock, and not lechery, nor secretly looking for paramours. But if they are married and guilty of adultery, inflict on them half the punishment (enjoined) for gentlewomen. This is for those who are afraid of doing wrong. In case they can wait, it is better for them.

(Do not regard marriage to such believing maidens as a degradation. Rather, degradation is deviating into licentiousness without marrying.) God knows well all about your faith (and measures you by it); and (whether you be free or slaves) you are one from another (belonging, as believers, to the same faith and community). Marry them, then, with the leave of their guardians, and give them their bridal-due according to religiously lawful and customary good practice, they being women who give themselves in honest chastity, not in licentiousness, nor having secret love-companions. Then if they commit indecency after they have entered into wedlock, they shall be liable to half the penalty to which free (unmarried) women are liable. That (permission to marry slave-girls) is for those of you who fear to fall into sin (by remaining unmarried).

And if after they are married they commit adultery then they incur (the punishment of fifty strips which is) half of that (punishment prescribed) for free women. This (permission to marry a bonds woman) is for him among you who fears (that otherwise he will fall into) sin. But it is better for you to exercise restraint.

But when they are in wedlock, if they commit indecency, they shall be liable to half the chastisement of freewomen.

This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practise self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And whoever has not the means wherewith, [whoever] is not wealthy enough, to be able to marry believing (al-mu'mint, `believing', is in accordance with the prevalent practice, and does not add to the import), free, women in wedlock, let him take, in marriage, believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith, so suffice yourself with its outward manifestation and leave the innermost matters to Him, for He is the One to know her [true] merit&#59; many a slavegirl may be more excellent [in faith] than a free woman, and this is meant to encourage marriage with slavegirls; the one of you is as the other, being equal in religion, so do not disdain to marry with them. So marry them, with the permission of their folk, their guardians, and give them their wages, their dowries, honourably, without procrastination or diminution, as women in wedlock (muhsant, a circumstantial qualifier), in decency, not illicitly, openly fornicating, or taking lovers, companions fornicating in secret. But when they are given in wedlock, [when] they are married off (a variant reading [for the passive uhsinna, `they are given in wedlock'] has the active ahsanna, `they enter into wedlock'), if they commit lewdness, such as adultery, they shall be liable to half the chastisement, the legal punishment, of married, free, virgin, women, who commit adultery, and are thus given fifty lashes and banished for half a year; [male] slaves by analogy are liable to the same punishment. Here, God has not made wedlock the precondition for the prescribed punishment to show that stoning does not apply in their case [sc. slavegirls]. That, marrying of slavegirls on account of insufficient means, is for those of you who fear the distress of sin, fornication (al-`anat originally means distress, but is used to mean zin, `fornication', because of the distress that it causes in the way of the punishment in this world and in the Hereafter), as opposed to those of you who might not have such a fear [of distress] with regard to their free women and for whom it is unlawful to marry her [the slavegirl]; likewise for one who has sufficient means to marry a free woman [it is unlawful for him to marry a slavegirl instead]&#59; this is the opinion of al- Shfi`. Moreover, God's words `believing maids' precludes unbelieving women, whom it is unlawful to marry, even if one should find no believing women and fear [the distress of fornication]; yet it is better for you to be patient, and abstain from marrying slavegirls, lest the child should become enslaved also. God is Forgiving, Merciful, by allowing room for manoeuvre in these matters.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Marrying a Female Slave, if One Cannot Marry a Free Woman</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ <br /> <br />And whoever of you have not, <br /> <br />Allah said, those who do not have, <br /> <br />مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً <br /> <br />the means, <br /> <br />financial capability, <br /> <br />أَن يَنكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْمُوْمِنَاتِ <br /> <br />Wherewith to wed free believing women, <br /> <br />meaning, free faithful, chaste women. <br /> <br />فَمِن مِّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُم مِّن فَتَيَاتِكُمُ الْمُوْمِنَاتِ <br /> <br />They may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess, <br /> <br />meaning, they are allowed to wed believing slave girls owned by the believers. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَانِكُمْ بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />and Allah has full knowledge about your faith; you are one from another. <br /> <br />Allah knows the true reality and secrets of all things, but you people know only the apparent things. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />فَانكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذْنِ أَهْلِهِنَّ <br /> <br />Wed them with the permission of their own folk, <br /> <br />indicating that the owner is responsible for the slave girl, and consequently, she cannot marry without his permission. The owner is also responsible for his male slave and they cannot wed without his permission. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />أَيُّمَا عَبْدٍتَزَوَّجَ بِغَيْرِ إِذْنِ مَوَالِيهِ فَهُوَ عَاهِر <br /> <br />Any male slave who marries without permission from his master, is a fornicator. <br /> <br />When the owner of the female slave is a female, those who are allowed to give away the free woman in marriage, with her permission, become responsible for giving away her female slave in marriage, as well. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> states that; <br /> <br />لَاا تُزَوِّجِ الْمَرْأَةُ الْمَرْأَةَ وَلَاا الْمَرْأَةُ نَفْسَهَا فَإِنَّ الزَّانِيَةَ هِيَ الَّتِي تُزَوِّجُ نَفْسَهَا <br /> <br />The woman does not give away another woman, or herself in marriage, for only the adulteress gives herself away in marriage. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> <br />And give them their due in a good manner; <br /> <br />meaning, pay them their dowry with a good heart, and do not keep any of it, belittling the matter due to the fact that they are owned slaves. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مُحْصَنَاتٍ <br /> <br />they should be chaste, <br /> <br />means, they are honorable women who do not commit adultery, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />غَيْرَ مُسَافِحَاتٍ <br /> <br />not fornicators, <br /> <br />referring to dishonorable women, who do not refrain from illicit sexual relations with those who ask. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the fornicating women are the whores, who do not object to having relations with whomever seeks it, while, <br /> <br />وَلَا مُتَّخِذَاتِ أَخْدَانٍ <br /> <br />nor promiscuous. <br /> <br />refers to taking boyfriends. <br /> <br />Similar was said by Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, Ata Al-Khurasani, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, Muqatil bin Hayyan and As-Suddi. <br /><b>The Slave Girl's Punishment for Adultery is Half that of a Free Unmarried Woman</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا أُحْصِنَّ فَإِنْ أَتَيْنَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ فَعَلَيْهِنَّ نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى الْمُحْصَنَاتِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />And after they have been taken in wedlock, if they commit <b>Fahishah</b>, their punishment is half of that for free (unmarried) women. <br /> <br />this is about the slave women who got married, as indicated by the <b>Ayah</b>; <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْمُوْمِنَاتِ فَمِن مِّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُم مِّن فَتَيَاتِكُمُ الْمُوْمِنَاتِ <br /> <br />And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess. <br /> <br />Therefore, since the honorable <b>Ayah</b> is about believing slave girls, then, <br />فَإِذَا أُحْصِنَّ <br /> (And after they have been taken in wedlock), refers to when they (believing slave girls) get married, as Ibn Abbas and others have said. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى الْمُحْصَنَاتِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />their punishment is half of that for free (unmarried) women. <br /> <br />indicates that the type of punishment prescribed here is the one that can be reduced to half, lashes in this case, not stoning to death, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ الْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ <br /> <br />This is for him among you who is afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body; <br /> <br />indicates that marrying slave girls, providing one satisfies the required conditions, is for those who fear for their chastity and find it hard to be patient and refrain from sex. <br /> <br />In this difficult circumstance, one is allowed to marry a slave girl. However, it is better to refrain from marrying slave girls and to observe patience, for otherwise, the offspring will become slaves to the girl's master. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَاللّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 24" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">25</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>25</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 26" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
