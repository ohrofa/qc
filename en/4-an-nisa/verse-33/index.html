So give them, now, their share, their portions of the inheritance, which is a sixth. God is ever Witness over everything, [ever] aware [of it], including your circumstances&#59; this verse was abrogated by His words, But those related by blood are nearer to one another [Q. 8&#59;75 and 33&#59;6].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah says; <br /> <br />وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ <br /> <br />And to everyone, We have appointed <b>Mawali</b>, of that left by parents and relatives. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Qatadah, Zayd bin Aslam, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, and others said; <br /><b>Mawali</b> means, &#34;Heirs.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas was also reported to have said that; <br /><b>Mawali</b> refers to relatives. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented, <br /> <br />&#34;The Arabs call the cousin a <b>Mawla</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir continued, &#34;Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالَاقْرَبُونَ <br /> <br />of that (property) left by parents and relatives. <br /> <br />means, from what he inherited from his parents and family members. <br /> <br />Therefore, the meaning of the <b>Ayah</b> becomes&#59;`To all of you, O people, We appointed relatives (such as children) who will later inherit what you inherited from your own parents and relatives.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَأتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ <br /> <br />To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood), give them their due portion. <br /> <br />means, &#34;Those with whom you have a pledge of brotherhood, give them their share of inheritance, thus fulfilling the ratified pledges that you gave them. Allah has witnessed all of you when you gave these pledges and promises.&#34; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, Allah is Ever a Witness over all things. <br /> <br />This practice was followed in the beginning of Islam, but was later on abrogated when Muslims were commanded to fulfill the pledges (brotherhood) they had already given, but to refrain from making any new pledges after that. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <b> <br />وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ <br /></b> (And to everyone, We have appointed <b>Mawali</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;meaning, heirs; <br />وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ <br /> (To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood). When the emigrants came to Al-Madinah, the emigrant would inherit from the <b>Ansar</b>, while the latter's relatives would not inherit from him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet established between them (the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse, <b> <br />وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ <br /></b> (And to everyone We have appointed <b>Mawali</b>) was revealed, it cancelled (the pledge of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#34; <br /> <br />Then he said, <br /> <br />&#34;The verse, <br />وَالَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَأتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ <br /> (To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood), give them their due portion) remained valid for cases of co-operation and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign something in one's will to the person who had the right of inheriting before.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 32" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>33</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 34" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
