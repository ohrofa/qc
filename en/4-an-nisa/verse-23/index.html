So Allah said; <br />وَرَبَايِبُكُمُ اللَّتِي فِي حُجُورِكُم مِّن نِّسَأيِكُمُ اللَّتِي دَخَلْتُم بِهِنَّ فَإِن لَّمْ تَكُونُواْ دَخَلْتُم بِهِنَّ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُم <br /> (Your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives unto whom you have gone in -- but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in unto them), to marry the stepdaughter. <br /><b>The Stepdaughter is Prohibited in Marriage Even if She Was Not Under the Guardianship of Her Stepfather</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَرَبَايِبُكُمُ اللَّتِي فِي حُجُورِكُم <br />your stepdaughters under your guardianship, <br /> <br />The majority of scholars state that the stepdaughter is prohibited in marriage for her stepfather (who consummated his marriage to her mother) whether she was under his guardianship or not. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahih</b> recorded that Umm Habibah said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah! Marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan (and in one narration `Azzah bint Abu Sufyan).&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَوَ تُحِبِّينَ ذلِك <br /> <br />&#34;Do you like that I do that?&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;I would not give you up for anything, but the best of whom I like to share with me in that which is righteously good, is my sister.&#34; <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ ذلِكِ لَاإ يَحِلُّ لِي <br /> <br />He said, &#34;That is not allowed for me.&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;We were told that you want to marry the daughter of Abu Salamah.&#34; <br /> <br />بِنْتَ أُمِّ سَلَمَة <br /> <br />He asked, &#34;The daughter of Umm Salamah&#34; <br /> <br />She said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />إِنَّهَا لَوْ لَمْ تَكُنْ رَبِيبَتِي فِي حِجْرِي مَا حَلَّتْ لِي إِنَّهَا لَبِنْتُ أَخِي مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ أَرْضَعَتْنِي وَأَبَا سَلَمَةَ ثُوَيْبَةُ فَلَ تَعْرِضْنَ عَلَيَّ بَنَاتِكُنَّ وَلَا أَخَوَاتِكُن <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Even if she was not my stepdaughter and under my guardianship, she is still not allowed for me because she is my niece from suckling, for Thuwaybah suckled me and Abu Salamah. Therefore, do not offer me to marry your daughters or sisters.&#34; <br /> <br />In another narration from Al-Bukhari, <br /> <br />إِنِّي لَوْ لَمْ أَتَزَوَّجْ أُمَّ سَلَمَةَ مَا حَلَّتْ لِي <br /> <br />Had I not married Umm Salamah, her daughter would not have been allowed for me anyway. <br /> <br />Consequently, the Messenger stated that his marriage to Umm Salamah was the real reason behind that prohibition. <br /><b>Meaning of `gone in unto them</b> <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> continues, <br /> <br />اللَّتِي دَخَلْتُم بِهِنَّ <br /> <br />Your wives unto whom you have gone in, <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas and several others, <br /> <br />meaning, had sexual relations with them. <br /><b>Prohibiting the Daughter-in-Law for Marriage</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br /> وَحَلَيِلُ أَبْنَايِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَبِكُمْ <br /> <br />The wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins, <br /> <br />Therefore, you are prohibited to marry the wives of your own sons, but not the wives of your adopted sons, as adoption was common practice in <b>Jahiliyyah</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا قَضَى زَيْدٌ مِّنْهَا وَطَراً زَوَّجْنَـكَهَا لِكَىْ لَا يَكُونَ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِى أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَأيِهِمْ <br /> <br />So when Zayd had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they had divorced them). (33&#59;37) <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked Ata about Allah's statement, <br />وَحَلَيِلُ أَبْنَايِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَبِكُمْ <br />(The wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins), <br /> <br />He said, `We were told that when the Prophet married the ex-wife of Zayd (who was the Prophet's adopted son before Islam prohibited this practice), the idolators in Makkah criticized him. Allah sent down the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَحَلَـيِلُ أَبْنَأيِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَـبِكُمْ <br /> <br />The wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins, <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَأءَكُمْ أَبْنَأءَكُمْ <br /> <br />nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. (33&#59;4) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَأ أَحَدٍ مّن رِّجَالِكُمْ <br /> <br />Muhammad is not the father of any of your men. (33&#59;40)&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan bin Muhammad said, <br /> <br />&#34;These Ayat are encompassing, <br />وَحَلَيِلُ أَبْنَايِكُمُ <br /> (the wives of your sons), and <br />وَأُمَّهَاتُ نِسَأيِكُمْ <br />(your wives' mothers). <br /> <br />This is also the explanation of Tawus, Ibrahim, Az-Zuhri and Makhul. <br /> <br />It means that these two <b>Ayat</b> encompass these types of women, whether the marriage was consummated or not, and there is a consensus on this ruling. <br /><b>A Doubt and Rebuttal</b> <br /> <br />Why is the wife of one's son from suckling prohibited for him for marriage - that is, if she is no longer married to his son from suckling - as the majority of scholars state, although they are not related by blood! <br /> <br />The answer is the Prophet's statement, <br /> <br />يَحْرُمُ مِنَ الرَّضَاعِ مَا يَحْرُمُ مِنَ النَّسَب <br /> <br />Suckling prohibits what blood relations prohibit. <br /><b>The Prohibition of Taking Two Sisters as Rival Wives</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَن تَجْمَعُواْ بَيْنَ الاُخْتَيْنِ إَلاَّ مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ <br />and two sisters in wedlock at the same time, except for what has already passed; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands&#59;you are prohibited to take two sisters as rival wives, or rival female-servants, except for what had happened to you during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, which We have forgiven and erased. Therefore, no one is allowed to take or keep two sisters as rival wives, according to the consensus of the scholars of the Companions, their followers, and the Imams of old and present. <br /> <br />They all stated that taking two sisters as rival wives is prohibited, and that whoever embraces Islam while married to two sisters at the same time is given the choice to keep one of them and divorce the other. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Fayruz said that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;I embraced Islam while married to two sisters at the same time and the Prophet commanded me to divorce one of them.&#34; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />verily, Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 22" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 24" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=23;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
