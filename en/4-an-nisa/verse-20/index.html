The Messenger of Allah never gave any of his wives, nor did any of his daughters receive a dowry more than twelve <b>Uwqiyah</b>. <br /> <br />A man used to pay a substantial dowry and thus conceal enmity towards his wife!&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad and the collectors of <b>Sunan</b> collected this Hadith through various chains of narration, and At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>&#34;. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that Masruq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Umar bin Al-Khattab stood up on the <b>Minbar</b> of the Messenger of Allah and said, <br /> <br />`O people! Why do you exaggerate concerning the dowry given to women! The Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to pay up to four hundred Dirhams for a dowry, or less than that. Had paying more for a dowry been a part of <b>Taqwa</b> or an honor, you would not have led them in this practice. Therefore, I do not want to hear about a man who pays more than four hundred Dirhams for a dowry.' <br /> <br />He then went down the <b>Minbar</b>, but a woman from Quraysh said to him, `O Leader of the Faithful! You prohibited people from paying more than four hundred Dirhams in a dowry for women!' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />She said, `Have you not heard what Allah sent down in the Qur'an?' <br /> <br />He said, `Which part of it?' <br /> <br />She said, `Have you not heard Allah's statement, <br />وَاتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنطَارًا <br /> (And you have given one of them a <b>Qintar</b>).' <br /> <br />He said, `O Allah! Forgive me...' <br /> <br />He then went back and stood up on the <b>Minbar</b> saying, `I had prohibited you from paying more than four hundred Dirhams in a dowry for women. So, let everyone pay what he likes from his money.&#34;' <br /> <br />The chain of narration for this Hadith is strong. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 19" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 21" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=20;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
