Rather, hold on to your money, take care of it, and be the one who spends on them for clothes, food and provision.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said that the Ayah, <br />وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفًا <br /> (and speak to them words of kindness and justice), <br /> <br />refers to kindness and keeping good relations. <br /> <br />This honorable <b>Ayah</b> commands kind treatment, in deed, with family and those under one's care. One should spend on them for clothes and provisions, and be good to them, such as saying good words to them. <br /><b>Giving Back the Property of the Orphans When They Reach Adulthood</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 4" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 6" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
