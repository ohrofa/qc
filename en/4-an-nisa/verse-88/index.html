What, do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray?, that is, to count them among the guided (the interrogative in both places is for disapproval). And he whom God sends astray, you will never find for him a way, a path to guidance.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Censuring the Companions for Disagreeing over the Hypocrites who Returned to Al-Madinah Before Uhud</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِيَتَيْنِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites! <br /> <br />Allah criticizes the believers for disagreeing over the hypocrites. <br /> <br />There are conflicting opinions over the reason behind revealing this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Zayd bin Thabit said that; <br /> <br />Messenger of Allah marched towards <b>Uhud</b>. However, some people who accompanied him went back to Al-Madinah, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah divided into two groups concerning them, one saying they should be killed and the other objecting. <br /> <br />Allah sent down, <br />فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِيَتَيْنِ <br /> (Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites). <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّهَا طَيْبَةُ وَإِنَّهَا تَنْفِي الْخَبَثَ كَمَا يَنْفِي الْكِيرُ خَبَثَ الْحَدِيد <br /> <br />She (Al-Madinah) is <b>Taybah</b>, and she expels filth, just as the billow expels rust from iron. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about some people in Makkah who said they embraced Islam, yet they gave their support to the idolators. One time, theses people went out of Makkah to fulfill some needs and said to each other, &#34;If we meet the Companions of Muhammad, there will be no harm for us from their side.&#34; <br /> <br />When the believers got news that these people went out of Makkah, some of them said, &#34;Let us march to these cowards and kill them, because they support your enemy against you.&#34; <br /> <br />However, another group from the believers said, &#34;Glory be to Allah! Do you kill a people who say as you have said, just because they did not perform <b>Hijrah</b> or leave their land. Is it allowed to shed their blood and confiscate their money in this case?&#34; <br /> <br />So they divided to two groups, while the Messenger was with them, and did not prohibit either group from reiterating their argument. <br /> <br />Thereafter, Allah revealed, <br />فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِيَتَيْنِ <br /> (Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites). <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ أَرْكَسَهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ <br /> <br />Allah has cast them back because of what they have earned. <br /> <br />meaning, He made them revert to, and fall into error. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that, <br />أَرْكَسَهُم <br /> (<b>Arkasahum</b>), <br /> <br />means, `cast them' . <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />بِمَا كَسَبُواْ <br /> (because of what they have earned), <br /> <br />means, because of their defiance and disobedience to the Messenger and following falsehood. <br /> <br />أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُواْ مَنْ أَضَلَّ اللّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do you want to guide him whom Allah has made to go astray! And he whom Allah has made to go astray, you will never find for him a way. <br /> <br />meaning, there will be no path for him, or way to guidance. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 87" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-87/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">88</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>88</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 89" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-89/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=88;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
