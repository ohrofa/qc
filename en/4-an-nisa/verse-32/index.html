Men go to battle, but we do not go to battle, and we earn one-half of the inheritance (that men get).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah sent down, <br />وَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ <br /> (And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others). <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَاء نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبْنَ <br /> <br />For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned, <br /> <br />indicates, according to Ibn Jarir, that each person will earn his wages for his works, a reward if his deeds are good, and punishment if his deeds are evil. <br /> <br />Al-Walibi reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> is talking about inheritance, indicating the fact that each person will get his due share of the inheritance. <br /> <br />Allah then directed the servants to what benefits them, <br /> <br />وَاسْأَلُواْ اللّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> <br />and ask Allah of His Bounty. <br /> <br />Therefore, the <b>Ayah</b> states, &#34;Do not wish for what other people were endowed with over you, for this is a decision that will come to pass, and wishing does not change its decree. However, ask Me of My favor and I will grant it to you, for I Am Most Generous and Most Giving.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah knows who deserves this life, and so He gives him riches, and whoever deserves poverty, He makes him poor. He also knows who deserves the Hereafter, and He directs him to perform the deeds that will help him to be successful in it, and whoever deserves failure, He prevents him from achieving righteousness and what leads to it. Hence, Allah said, <b> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا <br /></b> (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything)</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 31" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">32</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>32</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 33" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=32;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
