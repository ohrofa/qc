They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them, your [former] wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves, only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them, of the dowry, except when they commit flagrant (read mubayyina, `making it clear', or mubayyana, `clear') lewdness, such as adultery or rebellion, then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit [their dowries]. Consort with them in kindness, that is, being decent in speaking [to them], with regard to [their] expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them, then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good, that is to say, perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>Meaning of `Inheriting Women Against Their Will</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُواْ النِّسَاء كَرْهًا <br /> <br />O you who believe! You are not permitted to inherit women against their will, <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas said about the Ayah, <br /> <br />&#34;Before, the practice was that when a man dies, his male relatives used to have the right to do whatever they wanted with his wife. If one of them wants, he would marry her, give her in marriage, or prevent her from marriage, for they had more right to her than her own family. Thereafter, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about this practice, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُواْ النِّسَاء كَرْهًا <br /></b> (O you who believe! You are not permitted to inherit women against their will).&#34; <br /><b>Women Should not Be Treated with Harshness</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَا اتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ <br /> <br />nor to prevent them from marriage, in order to take part of what you have given them, <br /> <br />Allah commands&#59;Do not treat the woman harshly so that she gives back all or part of the dowry that she was given, or forfeits one of her rights by means of coercion and oppression. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ <br /> <br />unless they commit open <b>Fahishah</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Muhammad bin Sirin, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ata Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam and Sa`id bin Abi Hilal said that; <br /> <br />this refers to illicit sex. <br /> <br />Meaning that if the wife commits adultery, you are allowed to take back the dowry you gave her. You are also allowed to annoy her, until she gives back the dowry in return for a <b>Khula</b>. <br /> <br />In Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّأ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْيًا إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَأ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. (2&#59;229) <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak said that; <br /><b>Fahishah</b> refers to disobedience and defiance. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir chose the view that; <br /> <br />it is general, encompasses all these meanings, adultery, disobedience, defiance, rudeness, and so forth. <br /> <br />Meaning that he is allowed to annoy his wife when she does any of these acts until she forfeits all or part of her rights and he then separates from her, and this (view) is good, and Allah knows best. <br /><b>Live With Women Honorably</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> <br />And live with them honorably, <br /> <br />by saying kind words to them, treating them kindly and making your appearance appealing for them, as much as you can, just as you like the same from them. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِى عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br /> <br />And they have rights similar over them to what is reasonable. (2&#59;228) <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />خَيْرُكُمْ خَيْرُكُمْ لاَِهْلِهِ وَأَنَا خَيْرُكُمْ لاَِهْلِي <br /> <br />The best among you is he who is the best with his family. Verily, I am the best one among you with my family. <br /> <br />It was the practice of the Messenger of Allah to be kind, cheerful, playful with his wives, compassionate, spending on them and laughing with them. The Messenger used to race with Aishah, the Mother of the Faithful, as a means of kindness to her. <br /> <br />Aishah said, &#34;The Messenger of Allah raced with me and I won the race. This occurred before I gained weight, and afterwards I raced with him again, and he won that race. He said, <br /> <br />هذِهِ بِتِلْك <br /> <br />This (victory) is for that (victory).&#34; <br /> <br />When the Prophet was at the home of one of his wives, sometimes all of his wives would meet there and eat together, and they would then go back to their homes. He and his wife would sleep in the same bed, he would remove his upper garment, sleeping in only his lower garment. The Prophet used to talk to the wife whose night it was, after praying <b>Isha'</b> and before he went to sleep. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِى رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ <br /> <br />Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to follow. (33&#59;21) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْيًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good. <br /> <br />Allah says that your patience, which is demonstrated by keeping wives whom you dislike, carries good rewards for you in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;That the husband may feel compassion towards his wife and Allah gives him a child with her, and this child carries tremendous goodness.&#34; <br /> <br />An authentic Hadith states, <br /> <br />لَاا يَفْرَكْ مُوْمِنٌ مُوْمِنَةً إِنْ سَخِطَ مِنْهَا خُلُقًا رَضِيَ مِنْهَا اخَر <br /> <br />No believing man should hate his believing wife. If he dislikes a part of her conduct, he would surely like another. <br /><b>The Prohibition of Taking Back the Dowry</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمُ اسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَّكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَاتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنطَارًا فَلَ تَأْخُذُواْ مِنْهُ شَيْيًا أَتَأْخُذُونَهُ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 18" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 20" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=19;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
