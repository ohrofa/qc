The Jews broke the promises and vows that Allah took from them, and also rejected Allah's <b>Ayat</b>, meaning His signs and proofs, and the miracles that they witnessed at the hands of their Prophets. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقَتْلِهِمُ الَانْبِيَاء بِغَيْرِ حَقًّ <br /> <br />and their killing the Prophets unjustly, <br /> <br />because their many crimes and offenses against the Prophets of Allah, for they killed many Prophets, may Allah's peace be upon them <br /> <br />وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ <br /> <br />and their saying&#59;&#34;Our hearts are <b>Ghulf</b>,&#34; <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Qatadah. <br /> <br />meaning, wrapped with covering. <br /> <br />This is similar to the what the idolators said, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا فِى أَكِنَّةٍ مِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;Our hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us.&#34; (41&#59;5) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />بَلْ طَبَعَ اللّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ <br /> <br />nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, <br /> <br />It is as if they had given an excuse that their hearts do not understand what the Prophet says since their hearts are wrapped with coverings, so they claim. <br /> <br />Allah said that their hearts are sealed because of their disbelief, as we mentioned before in the explanation of Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />فَلَ يُوْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />so they believe not but a little. <br /> <br />for their hearts became accustomed to <b>Kufr</b>, transgression and weak faith. <br /><b>The Evil Accusation the Jews Uttered Against Maryam and Their Claim that They Killed `Isa</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَى مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَانًا عَظِيمًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 154" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-154/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">155</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>155</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 156" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-156/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
