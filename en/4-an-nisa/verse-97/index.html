Then, an arrow would hit one of them and kill him, or he would be struck on his neck (with a sword) and killed, and Allah sent down the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَليِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ <br /> (Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves).&#34;' <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak stated that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about some hypocrites who did not join the Messenger of Allah but remained in Makkah and went out with the idolators for the battle of <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />They were killed among those who were killed. Thus, this honorable <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about those who reside among the idolators, while able to perform <b>Hijrah</b> and unable to practice the faith. <br /> <br />Such people will be committing injustice against themselves and falling into a prohibition according to the consensus and also according to this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَليِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ <br /> (Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves), by refraining from <b>Hijrah</b>. <br /> <br />قَالُواْ فِيمَ كُنتُمْ <br /> <br />They (angels) say (to them)&#59;&#34;In what (condition) were you!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, why did you remain here and not perform <b>Hijrah</b>! <br /> <br />قَالُواْ كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />They reply&#59;&#34;We were weak and oppressed on the earth.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, we are unable to leave the land or move about in the earth. <br /> <br />قَالْوَاْ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُواْ فِيهَا <br /> <br />They (angels) say&#59;&#34;Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein!&#34; <br /> <br />فَأُوْلَـيِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَسَاءتْ مَصِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Such men will find their abode in Hell - what an evil destination! <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that; <br /> <br />Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ جَامَعَ الْمُشْرِكَ وَسَكَنَ مَعَهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِثْلُه <br /> <br />Whoever mingles with the idolator and resides with him, he is just like him. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاء وَالْوِلْدَانِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلً</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 96" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-96/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">97</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>97</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 98" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-98/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
