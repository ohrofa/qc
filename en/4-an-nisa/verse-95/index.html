God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home, on account of some injury, by a degree, by [a degree of] merit, since both have the same intention, but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each, of the two groups, God has promised the goodly reward, Paradise, and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home, without any injury, with a great reward (ajran `azman, is substituted by [the following, darajtin minhu]),</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Mujahid and those Who Do not Join Jihad are Not the Same, (and Jihad is Fard Kifayah)</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً <br /> <br />Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the <b>Ayah</b>, was revealed, the Messenger of Allah called Zayd and commanded him to write it. <br /> <br />Then, Ibn Umm Maktum came and mentioned that he was blind. Allah revealed, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame)).&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`di said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the <b>Masjid</b>. I came and sat by his side. He told us that Zayd bin Thabit told him that Allah's Messenger dictated this <b>Ayah</b> to him, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /></b> (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah). <br /> <br />Ibn Umm Maktum came to the Prophet as he was dictating that very <b>Ayah</b> to me. Ibn Umm Maktum said, `O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, if I had power, I would surely take part in <b>Jihad</b>.' <br /> <br />He was a blind man. So Allah sent down revelation to His Messenger while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me that I feared that my thigh would be broken. That ended after Allah revealed, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled).&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /></b>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled), <br /> <br />refers to those who did not go to the battle of <b>Badr</b> and those who went to <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />When the battle of <b>Badr</b> was about to occur, Abu Ahmad bin Jahsh and Ibn Umm Maktum said, `We are blind, O Messenger of Allah! Do we have an excuse?' <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /></b>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled) was revealed. <br /> <br />Allah made those who fight, above those who sit in their homes not hindered by disability. <br />وَفَضَّلَ اللّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br />(but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home), by a huge reward. Degrees of (higher) grades from Him), above the believers who sit at home without a disability hindering them.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>&#34;<b>.</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)) this is general. Soon after, the revelation came down with, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled). So whoever has a disability, such as blindness, a limp, or an illness that prevents them from joining <b>Jihad</b>, they were not compared to the Mujahidin who strive in Allah's cause with their selves and wealth, as those who are not disabled and did not join the <b>Jihad</b> were. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَقْوَامًا مَا سِرْتُمْ مِنْ مَسِيرٍ وَلَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ وَادٍ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ مَعَكُمْ فِيه <br /> <br />There are people who remained in Al-Madinah, who were with you in every march you marched and every valley you crossed. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;While they are still in Al-Madinah, O Messenger of Allah?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />نَعَمْ حَبَسَهُمُ الْعُذْر <br /> <br />Yes. Only their disability hindered them (from joining you). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكُـلًّ وَعَدَ اللّهُ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br />Unto each, Allah has promised good, <br /> <br />meaning, Paradise and tremendous rewards. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that <b>Jihad</b> is not <b>Fard</b> on each and every individual, but it is <b>Fard Kifayah</b> (which is a collective duty). <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَفَضَّلَ اللّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home), by a huge reward. <br /> <br />Allah mentions what He has given them rooms in Paradise, along with His forgiveness and the descent of mercy and blessing on them, as a favor and honor from Him. <br /> <br />So He said; <br /> <br />دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ اللّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 94" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-94/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">95</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>95</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 96" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-96/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=95;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
