Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the <b>Ayah</b>, was revealed, the Messenger of Allah called Zayd and commanded him to write it. <br /> <br />Then, Ibn Umm Maktum came and mentioned that he was blind. Allah revealed, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame)).&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`di said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the <b>Masjid</b>. I came and sat by his side. He told us that Zayd bin Thabit told him that Allah's Messenger dictated this <b>Ayah</b> to him, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /></b> (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah). <br /> <br />Ibn Umm Maktum came to the Prophet as he was dictating that very <b>Ayah</b> to me. Ibn Umm Maktum said, `O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, if I had power, I would surely take part in <b>Jihad</b>.' <br /> <br />He was a blind man. So Allah sent down revelation to His Messenger while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me that I feared that my thigh would be broken. That ended after Allah revealed, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled).&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /></b>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled), <br /> <br />refers to those who did not go to the battle of <b>Badr</b> and those who went to <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />When the battle of <b>Badr</b> was about to occur, Abu Ahmad bin Jahsh and Ibn Umm Maktum said, `We are blind, O Messenger of Allah! Do we have an excuse?' <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /></b>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled) was revealed. <br /> <br />Allah made those who fight, above those who sit in their homes not hindered by disability. <br />وَفَضَّلَ اللّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br />(but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home), by a huge reward. Degrees of (higher) grades from Him), above the believers who sit at home without a disability hindering them.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>&#34;<b>.</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />لااَّ يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)) this is general. Soon after, the revelation came down with, <br />غَيْرُ أُوْلِي الضَّرَرِ <br /> (except those who are disabled). So whoever has a disability, such as blindness, a limp, or an illness that prevents them from joining <b>Jihad</b>, they were not compared to the Mujahidin who strive in Allah's cause with their selves and wealth, as those who are not disabled and did not join the <b>Jihad</b> were. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَقْوَامًا مَا سِرْتُمْ مِنْ مَسِيرٍ وَلَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ وَادٍ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ مَعَكُمْ فِيه <br /> <br />There are people who remained in Al-Madinah, who were with you in every march you marched and every valley you crossed. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;While they are still in Al-Madinah, O Messenger of Allah?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />نَعَمْ حَبَسَهُمُ الْعُذْر <br /> <br />Yes. Only their disability hindered them (from joining you). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكُـلًّ وَعَدَ اللّهُ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br />Unto each, Allah has promised good, <br /> <br />meaning, Paradise and tremendous rewards. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that <b>Jihad</b> is not <b>Fard</b> on each and every individual, but it is <b>Fard Kifayah</b> (which is a collective duty). <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَفَضَّلَ اللّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home), by a huge reward. <br /> <br />Allah mentions what He has given them rooms in Paradise, along with His forgiveness and the descent of mercy and blessing on them, as a favor and honor from Him. <br /> <br />So He said; <br /> <br />دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ اللّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 94" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-94/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">95</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>95</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 96" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-96/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=95;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
