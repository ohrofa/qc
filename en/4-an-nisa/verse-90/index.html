Those who liked to have peace with Muhammad and his Companions and enter a pact with them were allowed. <br /> <br />It was reported that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was later abrogated by Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا انسَلَخَ الَاشْهُرُ الْحُرُمُ فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ <br /> <br />Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators wherever you find them. (9&#59;5) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَوْ جَأوُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ <br /> <br />or those who approach you with their breasts restraining, <br /> <br />referring to another type of people covered by the exclusion from fighting. They are those who approach the Muslims with hesitation in their hearts because of their aversion to fighting the Muslims. <br /> <br />أَن يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ أَوْ يُقَاتِلُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ <br /> <br />from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. <br /> <br />They do not have the heart to fight with the Muslims against their own people. Therefore, they are neither with nor against Muslims. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَاتَلُوكُمْ <br /> <br />Had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. <br /> <br />meaning, it is from Allah's mercy that He has stopped them from fighting you. <br /> <br />فَإِنِ اعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَمَ <br /> <br />So, if they withdraw from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, <br /> <br />meaning, they revert to peace. <br /> <br />فَمَا جَعَلَ اللّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />then Allah has opened no way for you against them. <br /> <br />you do not have the right to kill them, as long as they take this position. <br /> <br />This was the position of Banu Hashim (the tribe of the Prophet), such as Al-Abbas, who accompanied the idolators in the battle of <b>Badr</b>, for they joined the battle with great hesitation. This is why the Prophet commanded that Al-Abbas not be killed, but only captured. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 89" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-89/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">90</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>90</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 91" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-91/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=90;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
