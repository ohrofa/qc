They were also commanded to be forgiving and forbearing with the idolators and to observe patience with them at the time. However, they were eager and anticipating the time when they would be allowed to fight, so that they could punish their enemies. <br /> <br />The situation at that time did not permit armed conflict for many reasons. For instance, Muslims were few at the time, compared to their numerous enemies. The Muslims' city was a sacred one and the most honored area on the earth, and this is why the command to fight was not revealed in Makkah. <br /> <br />Later on when the Muslims controlled a town of their own, Al-Madinah, and had strength, power and support, <b>Jihad</b> was then legislated. Yet, when the command to fight was revealed, just as Muslims wished, some of them became weary and were very fearful of facing the idolators in battle. <br /> <br /> وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا الْقِتَالَ لَوْلا أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ <br /> <br />They say&#59;&#34;Our Lord! Why have You ordained for us fighting Would that You had granted us respite for a short period!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, we wish that <b>Jihad</b> was delayed until a later time, because it means bloodshed, orphans and widows. In a similar Ayah, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَإِذَا أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا الْقِتَالُ <br /> <br />Those who believe say&#59;&#34;Why is not a <b>Surah</b> sent down (for us) But when a decisive is sent down, and fighting is mentioned. (47&#59;20) <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Awf and several of his companions came to the Prophet while in Makkah and said, &#34;O Allah's Prophet! We were mighty when we were pagans, but when we embraced the faith, we became weak.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ بِالْعَفْوِ فَلَ تُقَاتِلُوا الْقَوْم <br /> <br />I was commanded to pardon the people, so do not fight them. <br /> <br />When Allah transferred the Prophet to Al-Madinah, He commanded him to fight (the idolators), but they (some Muslims) held back. So, Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b>; <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّواْ أَيْدِيَكُمْ <br /> (Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected by An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />قُلْ مَتَاعُ الدَّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَالاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ اتَّقَى <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears Allah, <br /> <br />means, the destination of the one who with <b>Taqwa</b> is better for him than this life. <br /> <br />وَلَا تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to the <b>Fatil</b>. <br /> <br />for your good deeds. Rather, you will earn your full rewards for them. <br /> <br />This promise directs the focus of believers away from this life and makes them eager for the Hereafter, all the while encouraging them to fight in Jihad. <br /><b>There is No Escaping Death</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 76" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-76/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">77</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>77</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 78" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-78/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=77;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
