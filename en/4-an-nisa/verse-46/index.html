If only they had said&#59; &#34;What hear and we obey&#34;; and &#34;Do hear&#34;; and &#34;Do look at us&#34;; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Some, group, from among the Jews distort, alter, the words, that God revealed in the Torah pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s), from their contexts, those [contexts] in which they were placed, and they say, to the Prophet (s), when he commands them something, `We have heard, your words, and we disobey, your command; and hear as one who does not hear' (wa'sma` ghayr musma`in is a circumstantial qualifier, functioning as an invocation, in other words, `And may you not hear!') and, they say to him, `Mind us' (r`in), [a term] with which it had been forbidden to address him, being a curse word in their language; twisting, distorting, with their tongues and slandering, defaming, religion, Islam. If they had said, `We have heard and obey', instead of `And we disobey', and, only, `Hear', and `Consider us,' (unzur ilayn) instead of r`in, it would have been better for them, than what they said, and more upright, more just than that, but God has cursed them, removing them from His mercy, for their unbelief, so they believe not except a few, among them, such as `Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ <br /> <br />Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places, <br /> <br />meaning, they intentionally and falsely alter the meanings of the Words of Allah and explain them in a different manner than what Allah meant. <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا <br /> <br />And say&#59;&#34;We hear your word and disobey, <br /> <br />Mujahid and Ibn Zayd explained, <br /> <br />saying, &#34;We hear what you say, O Muhammad, but we do not obey you in it.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the implied meaning of the <b>Ayah</b>, and it demonstrates the Jews' disbelief, stubbornness and disregard for Allah's Book after they understood it, all the while aware of the sin and punishment that this behavior will earn for them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ <br /> <br />And &#34;Hear and let you hear nothing.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />means, hear our words, may you never hear anything. <br /> <br />This is the Jews' way of mocking and jesting, may Allah's curse descend on them. <br /> <br />وَرَاعِنَا لَيًّا بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْنًا فِي الدِّينِ <br /> <br />And <b>Ra`ina</b>, with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion. <br /> <br />meaning, they pretend to say, `Hear us,' when they say, <b>Ra`ina</b> (an insult in Hebrew, but in Arabic it means `Listen to us.').' Yet, their true aim is to curse the Prophet. <br /> <br />We mentioned this subject when we explained Allah's statement, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تَقُولُواْ رَاعِنَا وَقُولُواْ انظُرْنَا <br /></b> (O you who believe! Say not <b>Ra`ina</b> but say <b>Unzurna</b> (make us understand)). (2&#59;104) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah said about them, while they pretend to say other than what they truly mean, <br /> لَيًّا بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْنًا فِي الدِّينِ <br /> (With a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion) because of their cursing the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَاسْمَعْ وَانظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ اللّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلَ يُوْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And if only they had said&#59;&#34;We hear and obey&#34;, and &#34;Do make us understand,&#34; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few. <br /> <br />meaning, their hearts are cast away from the path of righteousness and therefore, no beneficial part of faith enters it. <br /> <br />Earlier, when we explained, <b> <br />فَقَلِيلً مَّا يُوْمِنُونَ <br /></b> (so little is that which they believe) (2&#59;88) which means they do not have beneficial faith</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 45" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">46</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>46</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 47" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
