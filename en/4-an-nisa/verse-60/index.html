The hypocrite called on Ka`b b. al-Ashraf, to arbitrate between them, while the Jew called on the Prophet (s). When they came to him, the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied, and so they went before `Umar. The Jew told him what had happened, whereupon he [`Umar] turned to the hypocrite and asked him, `Is this true?', and when he replied, `Yes', he [`Umar] killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, desiring to take their disputes to a false deity (tght), one excessive in tempting [others] to falsehood (tughyn), namely, Ka`b b. al-Ashraf, when they have been commanded to renounce him?, and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them, far astray, from the truth.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>Referring to Other than the Qur'an and Sunnah for Judgment is Characteristic of Non-Muslims</b> <br /> <br />Allah <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ امَنُواْ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُواْ إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُواْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِهِ وَيُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَن يُضِلَّهُمْ ضَلَلاً بَعِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgment (in their disputes) to the Taghut while they have been ordered to reject them. But <b>Shaytan</b> wishes to lead them far astray. <br /> <br />Allah chastises those who claim to believe in what Allah has sent down to His Messenger and to the earlier Prophets, yet they refer to other than the Book of Allah and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger for judgment in various disputes. <br /> <br />It was reported that the reason behind revealing this <b>Ayah</b> was that; <br /> <br />a man from the <b>Ansar</b> and a Jew had a dispute, and the Jew said, &#34;Let us refer to Muhammad to judge between us.&#34; <br /> <br />However, the Muslim man said, &#34;Let us refer to Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf (a Jew) to judge between us.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also reported that; <br /> <br />the Ayah was revealed about some hypocrites who pretended to be Muslims, yet they sought to refer to the judgment of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>. <br /> <br />Other reasons were also reported behind the revelation of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />However, the <b>Ayah</b> has a general meaning, as it chastises all those who refrain from referring to the Qur'an and <b>Sunnah</b> for judgment and prefer the judgment of whatever they chose of falsehood, which befits the description of <b>Taghut</b> here. This is why Allah said, <b> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ امَنُواْ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ <br /></b> (and they wish to go for judgment to the <b>Taghut</b>) until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَى مَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ وَإِلَى الرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ الْمُنَافِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُودًا</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 59" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>60</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 61" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=60;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
