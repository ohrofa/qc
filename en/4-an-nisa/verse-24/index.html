So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <b> <br />وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاء إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ <br /></b> (Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir and Muslim in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كِتَابَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />Thus has Allah ordained for you. <br /> <br />means, this prohibition was ordained for you by Allah. Therefore, adhere to Allah's Book, do not transgress His set limits, and adhere to His legislation and decrees. <br /><b>The Permission to Marry All Other Women</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأُحِلَّ لَكُم مَّا وَرَاءَ ذَلِكُمْ <br /> <br />All others are lawful, <br /> <br />meaning, you are allowed to marry women other than the prohibited types mentioned here, as Ata and others have stated. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَن تَبْتَغُواْ بِأَمْوَالِكُم مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ <br /> <br />provided you seek them (with a dowry) from your property, desiring chastity, not fornication, <br /> <br />meaning, you are allowed to use your money to marry up to four wives and for (the purchase of) as many female slaves as you like, all through legal means, <br />مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ <br /> ((desiring) chastity, not fornication). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَمَا اسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَأتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً <br /> <br />So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due, <br /> <br />means, to enjoy them sexually, surrender to them their rightful dowry as compensation. <br /> <br />In other <b>Ayat</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُ وَقَدْ أَفْضَى بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />And how could you take it (back) while you have gone in unto each other, (4&#59;21) <br /> <br />وَاتُواْ النَّسَاء صَدُقَاتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً <br /> <br /> <br />And give to the women (whom you marry) their dowry with a good heart, (4&#59;4) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّأ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what (dowry) you gave them. (2&#59;229) <br /><b>Prohibiting the Mut`ah of Marriage</b> <br /> <br />Mujahid stated that, <br /><b> <br />فَمَا اسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَأتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً <br /></b> (So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due) was revealed about the <b>Mut`ah</b> marriage. <br /> <br />A <b>Mut`ah</b> marriage is a marriage that ends upon a predetermined date. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that the Leader of the Faithful Ali bin Abi Talib said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah prohibited <b>Mut`ah</b> marriage and eating the meat of domesticated donkeys on the day of Khyber (battle).&#34; <br /> <br />In addition, in his <b>Sahih</b>, Muslim recorded that Ar-Rabi bin Sabrah bin Ma`bad Al-Juhani said that his father said that; <br /> <br />he accompanied the Messenger of Allah during the conquest of Makkah, and that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي كُنْتُ أَذِنْتُ لَكُمْ فِي الاسْتِمْتَاعِ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ وَإنَّ اللهَ قَدْ حَرَّمَ ذَلِكَ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَمَنْ كَانَ عِنَدَهُ مِنْهُنَّ شَيْءٌ فَلْيُخَلِّ سَبِيلَهُ وَلَاا تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا اتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شييًا <br /> <br />O people! I allowed you the <b>Mut`ah</b> marriage with women before. Now, Allah has prohibited it until the Day of Resurrection. Therefore, anyone who has any women in <b>Mut`ah</b>, let him let them go, and do not take anything from what you have given them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَاضَيْتُم بِهِ مِن بَعْدِ الْفَرِيضَةِ <br /> <br />but if you agree mutually (to give more) after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you. <br /> <br />is similar to His other statement, <br /> <br />وَءَاتُواْ النِّسَأءَ صَدُقَـتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً <br /> <br />And give to the women their dowry with a good heart. (4&#59;4) <br /> <br />The meaning of these <b>Ayat</b> is&#59; <br /> <br />If you have stipulated a dowry for her, and she later forfeits it, either totally or partially, then this bears no harm on you or her in this case. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;Al-Hadrami said that some men would designate a certain dowry, but then fall into financial difficulties. Therefore, Allah said that there is no harm on you, O people, concerning your mutual agreement after the requirement (has been determined).&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, if she gives up part of the dowry, then you men are allowed to accept that. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise. <br /> <br />is suitable here, after Allah mentioned these prohibitions</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 23" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>24</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 25" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=24;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
