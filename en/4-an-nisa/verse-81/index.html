Allah will certainly punish them for this conduct. <br /> <br />In a similar <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيِقُولُونَ امَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّى فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ وَمَأ أُوْلَـيِكَ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />They say&#59;&#34;We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey,&#34; then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers. (24&#59;47) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ <br /> <br />So turn aside from them, <br /> <br />means, pardon them, be forbearing with them, do not punish them, do not expose them to the people and do not fear them. <br /> <br />وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّهِ وَكَفَى بِاللّهِ وَكِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs. <br /> <br />meaning, He is sufficient as Protector, Supporter and Helper for those who rely on Him and return to Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 80" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-80/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">81</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>81</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 82" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
