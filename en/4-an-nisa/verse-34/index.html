Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended of their property. Righteous women are therefore obedient, guarding the secret for God's guarding. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them. If they then obey you, look not for any way against them; God is All-high, All-great.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Husbands should take good care of their wives, with [the bounties] God has given to some more than others and with what they spend out of their own money. Righteous wives are devout and guard what God would have them guard in their husbands’ absence. If you fear high-handedness from your wives, remind them [of the teachings of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them.If they obey you, you have no right to act against them: God is most high and great.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Men are overseers over women, by reason of that wherewith Allah hath made one of them excel over anot her, and by reason of that which they expend of their substance. Wherefore righteous women are obedient, and are watchers in husbands absence by the aid and protection of Allah. And those wives whose refractoriness ye fear, exhort them, and avoid them in beds, and beat them; but if they obey you, seek not a way against them; verily Allah is ever Lofty, Grand.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance)&#59; For Allah is Most High, great (above you all).</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Men are the protec-tors and maintainers of women because Allah has made one of them excel over the other, and because they spend out of their possessions (to support them). Thus righteous women are obedient and guard the rights of men in their absence under Allah's protection. As for women of whom you fear rebellion, admonish them, and remain apart from them in beds, and beat them. Then if they obey you, do not seek ways to harm them. Allah is Exalted, Great.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing). If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them. Surely God is sublime and great.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made one of them superior to the other, and because men spend their wealth for the women; so virtuous women are the reverent ones, guarding behind their husbands the way Allah has decreed guarding; and the women from whom you fear disobedience, (at first) advise them and (then) do not cohabit with them, and (lastly) beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek to do injustice to them; indeed Allah is Supreme, Great.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>Men are the managers of women, because of the advantage Allah has granted some of them over others, and by virtue of their spending out of their wealth. Righteous women are obedient and watchful in the absence [of their husbands] in guarding what Allah has enjoined [them] to guard. As for those [wives] whose misconduct you fear, [first] advise them, and [if ineffective] keep away from them in the bed, and [as the last resort] beat them. Then if they obey you, do not seek any course [of action] against them. Indeed Allah is all-exalted, all-great.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Men (those who are able to carry out their responsibilities) are the protectors and maintainers of women inasmuch as God has endowed some of people (in some respects) with greater capacity than others and inasmuch as they (the men) spend of their wealth (for the family’s maintenance). Good, righteous women are the devoted ones (to God) and observant (of their husbands’ rights), who guard the secrets (family honor and property, their chastity, and their husband’s rights, especially where there is none to see them and in the absence of men) as God guards and keeps undisclosed (what should be guarded and private). As for those women from whose determined disobedience and breach of their marital obligations you have reason to fear, admonish them (to do what is right); then, (if that proves to be of no avail), remain apart from them in beds; then (if that too proves to be of no avail) beat them (lightly without beating them in their faces). Then if they obey you (in your directing them to observe God’s rights and their marital obligations) do not seek ways against them (to harm them). (Be ever mindful that) God is indeed All-Exalted, All-Great.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Men are the full maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them excel the other, and because men spend out of their wealth on them. So virtuous women are those who are obedient (to Allâh) and guard (their own chastity as well as the rights and secrets of their husbands even) in (their) absence, as Allâh has guarded (the women´s rights). As for those women (on whose part) you apprehend disobedience and bad behavior, you may admonish them (first lovingly) and (then) refuse to share their beds with them and (as a last resort) punish them (mildly). If they, then, obey you, you shall seek no other way against them. Indeed, Allâh alone is High, (and) Great.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>The men (are) taking care of matters for livelihood on (for) the women with what God preferred/favoured some of them (men and women) on some, and with what they spent from their (M) properties/possession , so the correct/righteous females are obeying humbly , worshipping humbly, protecting/safekeeping to the invisible with what God protected ; and those whom (F) you fear their (F) quarrel (disobedience) , so advise/warn them (F) and desert/abandon them (F) in the place of lying down (beds), and ignore/disregard/push them (F) , so if they obeyed you, so do not oppress/transgress on them (F) a way/method, that God was/is high, mighty/great.</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made one of them superior to the other, and because men spend their wealth for the women; so virtuous women are the reverent ones, guarding behind their husbands the way Allah has decreed guarding; and the women from whom you fear disobedience, (at first) advise them and (then) do not cohabit with them, and (lastly) beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek to do injustice to them; indeed Allah is Supreme, Great.</p></div><div id="hamid-s-aziz"><h3><span>13</span> Hamid S.

Verily, Allah loves not him who is proud and boastful;</p></div><div id="hilali"><h3><span>14</span> Hilali & Khan</h3><p>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband's absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband's property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.</p></div><div id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><h3><span>15</span> Maulana Mohammad Ali</h3><p>And to every one We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near relatives leaves. And as to those with whom your right hands have ratified agreements, give them their due. Surely Allah is ever Witness over all things.</p></div><div id="shakir"><h3><span>16</span> Mohammad Habib Shakir</h3><p>Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.</p></div><div id="pickthall"><h3><span>17</span> Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</h3><p>Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great.</p></div><div id="sarwar"><h3><span>18</span> Muhammad Sarwar</h3><p>Men are the protectors of women because of the greater preference that God has given to some of them and because they financially support them. Among virtuous women are those who are steadfast in prayer and dependable in keeping the secrets that God has protected. Admonish women who disobey (God's laws), do not sleep with them and beat them. If they obey (the laws of God), do not try to find fault in them. God is High and Supreme.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>Men are the maintainers of women for that Allah has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have spent of their wealth. Righteous women are obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah has guarded. Those from whom you fear rebelliousness, admonish them and desert them in the bed and smack them (without harshness). Then, if they obey you, do not look for any way against them. Allah is High, Great.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are Qanitat, and guard in the husband's absence what Allah orders them to guard. As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, and beat them, but if they return to obedience, do not seek a means against them. Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>Men are protectors of women, because God has made some of them excel others and because they spend their wealth on them. So virtuous women are obedient and guard in the husband's absence what God would have them guard. As for those from whom you apprehend infidelity, admonish them, then refuse to share their beds, and finally hit them [lightly]. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. For God is High, Great.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, as God has given some of them an advantage over others, and because they spend out of their wealth. The good women are obedient, guarding what God would have them guard. As for those from whom you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, then strike them. But if they obey you, seek no way against them. God is Sublime, Great.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Men are in charge of, they have authority over, women, disciplining them and keeping them in check, because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other, that is, because God has given them the advantage over women, in knowledge, reason, authority and otherwise, and because of what they expend, on them [the women], of their property. Therefore righteous women, among them, are obedient, to their husbands, guarding in the unseen, that is, [guarding] their private parts and otherwise during their spouses' absence, because of what God has guarded, for them, when He enjoined their male spouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious, disobedient to you, when such signs appear, admonish them, make them fear God, and share not beds with them, retire to other beds if they manifest such disobedience, and strike them, but not violently, if they refuse to desist [from their rebellion] after leaving them [in separate beds]. If they then obey you, in what is desired from them, do not seek a way against them, a reason to strike them unjustly. God is ever High, Great, so beware of Him, lest He punish you for treating them unjustly.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah said, <br /> <br />الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء <br /> <br />Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, <br /> <br />meaning, the man is responsible for the woman, and he is her maintainer, caretaker and leader who disciplines her if she deviates. <br /> <br />بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, <br /> <br />meaning, because men excel over women and are better than them for certain tasks. This is why Prophethood was exclusive of men, as well as other important positions of leadership. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَنْ يُفْلِحَ قَوْمٌ وَلَّوْا أَمْرَهُمُ امْرَأَة <br /> <br />People who appoint a woman to be their leader, will never achieve success. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Such is the case with appointing women as judges or on other positions of leadership. <br /> <br />وَبِمَا أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ <br /> <br />and because they spend from their means. <br /> <br />meaning the dowry, expenditures and various expenses that Allah ordained in His Book and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger for men to spend on women. For these reasons it is suitable that he is appointed her maintainer, just as Allah said, <b> <br />وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ <br /></b> (But men have a degree (of responsibility) over them). (2&#59;228) <br /><b>Qualities of the Righteous Wife</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَالصَّالِحَاتُ <br /> <br />Therefore, the righteous (women), <br /> <br />قَانِتَاتٌ <br /> <br />are <b>Qanitat</b>, <br /> <br />obedient to their husbands, as Ibn Abbas and others stated. <br /> <br />حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ <br /> <br />and guard in the husband's absence, <br /> <br />As-Suddi and others said that; <br /> <br />it means she protects her honor and her husband's property when he is absent. <br /> <br />and Allah's statement, <br /> <br />بِمَا حَفِظَ اللّهُ <br /> <br />what Allah orders them to guard. <br /> <br />means, the protected (husband) is the one whom Allah protects. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />خَيْرُ النِّسَاءِ امْرَأَةٌ إِذَا نَظَرْتَ إِلَيْهَا سَرَّتْكَ وَإِذَا أَمَرْتَهَا أَطَاعَتْكَ وَإِذَا غِبْتَ عَنْهَا حَفِظَتْكَ فِي نَفْسِهَا وَمَالِك <br /> <br />The best women is she who when you look at her, she pleases you, when you command her she obeys you, and when you are absent, she protects her honor and your property. <br /> <br />Then, the Messenger of Allah recited the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء <br /> (Men are the protectors and maintainers of women), until its end. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا صَلَّتِ الْمَرْأَةُ خَمْسَهَا وَصَامَتْ شَهْرَهَا وَحَفِظَتْ فَرْجَهَا وَأَطَاعَتْ زَوْجَهَا قِيلَ لَهَا ادْخُلِي الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أَيِّ الاَْبْوَابِ شِيْت <br /> <br />If the woman prayed her five daily prayers, fasted her month, protected her chastity and obeyed her husband, she will be told, 'Enter Paradise from any of its doors you wish.' <br /><b>Dealing with the Wife's Ill-Conduct</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ <br /> <br />As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, <br /> <br />meaning, the woman from whom you see ill conduct with her husband, such as when she acts as if she is above her husband, disobeys him, ignores him, dislikes him, and so forth. When these signs appear in a woman, her husband should advise her and remind her of Allah's torment if she disobeys him. Indeed, Allah ordered the wife to obey her husband and prohibited her from disobeying him, because of the enormity of his rights and all that he does for her. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَوْ كُنْتُ امِرًا أَحَدًا أَنْ يَسْجُدَ لاَِحَدٍ لَاَمَرْتُ الْمَرْأَةَ أَنْ تَسْجُدَ لِزَوْجِهَا مِنْ عِظَمِ حَقِّهِ عَلَيْهَا <br /> <br />If I were to command anyone to prostrate before anyone, I would have commanded the wife to prostrate before her husband, because of the enormity of his right upon her. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا دَعَا الرَّجُلُ امْرَأَتَهُ إِلى فِرَاشِهِ فَأَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ لَعَنَتْهَا الْمَلَيِكَةُ حَتَّى تُصْبِح <br /> <br />If the man asks his wife to come to his bed and she declines, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded it with the wording, <br /> <br />إِذَا بَاتَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ هَاجِرَةً فِرَاشَ زَوْجِهَا لَعَنَتْهَا الْمَلَيِكَةُ حَتَّى تُصْبِح <br /> <br />If the wife goes to sleep while ignoring her husband's bed, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ <br /> <br />As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them (first). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ <br /> <br />abandon them in their beds, <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The abandonment refers to not having intercourse with her, to lie on her bed with his back to her.&#34; <br /> <br />Several others said similarly. <br /> <br />As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, Ikrimah, and Ibn Abbas, in another narration, added, <br /> <br />&#34;Not to speak with her or talk to her.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Sunan</b> and <b>Musnad</b> compilers recorded that Muawiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him&#34; The Prophet said, <br /> <br />أَنْ تُطْعِمَهَا إِذَا طَعِمْتَ وَتَكْسُوَهَا إِذَا اكْتَسَيْتَ وَلَا تَضْرِبِ الْوَجْهَ وَلَا تُقَبِّحْ وَلَا تَهْجُرْ إِلاَّ فِي الْبَيْت <br /> <br />To feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ <br /> <br />beat them, <br /> <br />means, if advice and ignoring her in the bed do not produce the desired results, you are allowed to discipline the wife, without severe beating. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell <b>Hajj</b>, the Prophet said; <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُوا اللهَ فِي النِّسَاءِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ عِنْدَكُمْ عَوَانٍ وَلَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَنْ لَاا يُوطِيْنَ فُرُشَكُمْ أَحَدًا تَكْرَهُونَهُ فَإِنْ فَعَلْنَ ذَلِكَ فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِحٍ وَلَهُنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوف <br /> <br />Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and several others said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to a beating that is not violent. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that; <br /> <br />it means, a beating that is not severe. <br /><b>When the Wife Obeys Her Husband, Means of Annoyance Against Her are Prohibited</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَ تَبْغُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلً <br /> <br />but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance), <br /> <br />meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great. <br /> <br />reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 33" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">34</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>34</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 35" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-35/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=34;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
