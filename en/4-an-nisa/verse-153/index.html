The Jews only asked for this because of their stubbornness, defiance, rejection and disbelief. <br /> <br />The disbelievers of Quraysh also asked for similar things from the Prophet, as is mentioned in Surah <b>Al-Isra'</b>, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّوْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; (17&#59;90) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَقَدْ سَأَلُواْ مُوسَى أَكْبَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ فَقَالُواْ أَرِنَا اللّهِ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ بِظُلْمِهِمْ <br /> <br />Indeed, they asked Musa for even greater than that, when they said, &#34;Show us Allah in public,&#34; but they were struck with a bolt of lightning for their wickedness. <br /> <br />injustice, transgression, defiance and rebellion. This part was explained in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>. <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَـمُوسَى لَن نُّوْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ الصَّـعِقَةُ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ <br /> <br />ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br />And (remember) when you said&#59;&#34;O Musa! We shall never believe in you until we see Allah plainly.&#34; But you were struck by a bolt of lightning while you were looking. Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful. (2&#59;55,56) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اتَّخَذُواْ الْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ <br /> <br />Then they worshipped the calf even after <b>Al-Bayyinat</b> had come to them. <br /> <br />meaning, after they witnessed the tremendous miracles and unequivocal proofs at the hand of Musa in Egypt. They also witnessed the demise of their enemy, Fir`awn and his soldiers, when they all drowned in the sea. Yet soon after, when they passed by a people who were worshipping idols, they said to Musa, <b> <br />اجْعَل لَّنَا إِلَـهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ الِهَةٌ <br /></b> (Make for us a god as they have gods). (7&#59;138) <br /> <br />Allah explains the story of the Jews worshipping the calf in Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b> (7) and Surah <b>Ta Ha</b> (20) after Musa went to meet with his Lord. When Musa returned, Allah decreed that in order for the Jews to earn accepted repentance, then those who did not worship the calf would have to kill those who worshipped it. They complied with this command, and Allah resurrected them afterwards. <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />فَعَفَوْنَا عَن ذَلِكَ وَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى سُلْطَانًا مُّبِينًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />(Even) so We forgave them. And We gave Musa a clear proof of authority. <br /> <br />Allah then said</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 152" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-152/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">153</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>153</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 154" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-154/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=153;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
