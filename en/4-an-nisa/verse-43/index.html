Do not approach <b>Salah</b> while you are in a drunken state until you know what you are saying, <br /> <br />Allah forbade His believing servants from praying while drunk, for one does not know the meaning of what he is saying in that state, and He forbade them from attending the <b>Masjids</b> while sexually impure, except when one is just passing through the <b>Masjid</b> from one door to another. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> was revealed before alcohol consumption was completely prohibited, as evident by the <b>Hadith</b> that we mentioned in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b> when we explained Allah's statement, <b> <br />يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِر <br /></b> (They ask you about alcoholic drink and gambling). (2&#59;219) <br /> <br />In that <b>Hadith</b>, the Messenger of Allah recited this <b>Ayah</b> to Umar, who said, &#34;O Allah! Explain the ruling about <b>Khamr</b> (intoxicants) for us in a plain manner.&#34; <br /> <br />When this <b>Ayah</b> (4&#59;43) was revealed, the Prophet recited it to Umar, who still said, &#34;O Allah! Explain the ruling about <b>Khamr</b> (intoxicants) for us in a plain manner.&#34; <br /> <br />After that, they would not drink alcohol close to the time of prayer. When Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالَانصَابُ وَالَازْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />O you who believe! alcoholic drinks, gambling, <b>Al-Ansab</b>, and <b>Al-Azlam</b> are an abomination of <b>Shaytan's</b> handiwork. So avoid that in order that you may be successful (5&#59;90) until, <b> <br />فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّنتَهُونَ <br /></b>So, will you not then abstain! (5&#59;91) was revealed. <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;We abstain, we abstain.&#34; <br /> <br />In another narration, when the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b>was revealed, <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تَقْرَبُواْ الصَّلَةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَارَى حَتَّىَ تَعْلَمُواْ مَا تَقُولُونَ <br /> (O you who believe! Do not approach <b>Salah</b> while you are in a drunken state until you know what you are saying), at the time of prayer, the Messenger of Allah would have someone proclaim; &#34;Let not any drunk approach the prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording collected by Abu Dawud. <br /><b>Causes of Its Revelation</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim has recorded some reports about the incident of its revelation&#59; <br /> <br />Sa`d said, &#34;Four Ayat were revealed concerning me. <br /> <br />A man from the <b>Ansar</b> once made some food and invited some <b>Muhajirin</b> and Ansar men to it, and we ate and drank until we became intoxicated. We then boasted about our status.&#34; <br /> <br />Then a man held a camel's bone and injured Sa`d's nose, which was scarred ever since. This occurred before <b>Al-Khamr</b> was prohibited, and Allah later revealed, <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تَقْرَبُواْ الصَّلَةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَارَى <br /> (O you who believe! Approach not <b>As Salat</b> (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state). <br /> <br />Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, and the collectors of the <b>Sunan</b> recorded it, with the exception of Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />Another Reason Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talib said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf made some food to which he invited us and served some alcohol to drink. When we became intoxicated, and the time for prayer came, they asked someone to lead us in prayer. He recited `Say, `O disbelievers! I do not worship that which you worship, but we worship that which you worship (refer to the correct wording of the Surah&#59;109).&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah then revealed, <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لَا تَقْرَبُواْ الصَّلَةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَارَى حَتَّىَ تَعْلَمُواْ مَا تَقُولُونَ <br /> (O you who believe! Do not approach <b>Salah</b> when you are in a drunken state until you know what you are saying).&#34; <br /> <br />This is the narration collected by Ibn Abi Hatim and At-Tirmidhi, who said &#34;<b>Hasan</b> <b>GharibSahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />حَتَّىَ تَعْلَمُواْ مَا تَقُولُونَ <br /> <br />until you know what you are saying, <br /> <br />is the best description for when one is intoxicated, that is, when he does not know the meaning of what he is saying. When a person is drunk, he makes obvious mistakes in the recitation and will not be able to be humble during the prayer. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا نَعَسَ أَحَدُكُمْ وَهُوَ يُصَلِّي فَلْيَنْصَرِفْ فَلْيَنَمْ حَتَّى يَعْلَمَ مَا يَقُول <br /> <br />If one feels sleepy while he is praying, let him sleep for a while so that he knows the meaning of what he is saying. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />In some of the narrations of this Hadith, the Messenger said, <br /> <br />فَلَعَلَّهُ يَذْهَبُ يَسْتَغْفِرُ فَيَسُبَّ نَفْسَه <br />For he might want to ask for forgiveness, but instead curses himself! <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا جُنُبًا إِلاَّ عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ حَتَّىَ تَغْتَسِلُواْ <br /> <br />nor while <b>Junub</b> (sexually impure), except while passing through, until you bathe (your entire body), <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said that Allah's statement, <br /> <br />means, &#34;Do not enter the <b>Masjid</b> when you are <b>Junub</b>, unless you are just passing by, in which case, you pass through without sitting down.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim said that similar is reported from Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Anas, Abu `Ubaydah, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Abu Ad-Duha, Ata, Mujahid, Masruq, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Zayd bin Aslam, Abu Malik, `Amr bin Dinar, Al-Hakam bin Utaybah, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Yahya bin Sa`id Al-Ansari, Ibn Shihab and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Yazid bin Abi Habib commented on Allah's statement, <br />وَلَا جُنُبًا إِلاَّ عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ <br /> (nor while <b>Junub</b> (sexually impure), except while passing through), <br /> <br />when some men from the <b>Ansar</b>, whose doors literally opened into the <b>Masjid</b>, were sexually impure, and they did not have water, their only way to get water was to pass through the Masjid. So, Allah sent down, <br />وَلَا جُنُبًا إِلاَّ عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ <br /> (nor while Junub (sexually impure), except while passing through).&#34; <br /> <br />What supports this statement by Yazid bin Abi Habib, may Allah have mercy upon him, is Al-Bukhari's report in his <b>Sahih</b>, that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />سُدُّوا كُلَّ خَوْخَةٍ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ إِلاَّ خَوْخَةَ أَبِي بَكْر <br /> <br />Close all the small doors in this <b>Masjid</b>, except that of Abu Bakr. <br /> <br />This is what the Prophet commanded at the end of his life, knowing that Abu Bakr will be the <b>Khalifah</b> after him, and that he would need to enter the <b>Masjid</b> on numerous occasions to manage the important affairs of the Muslims. Yet, the Messenger of Allah commanded that all the small doors that open into the <b>Masjid</b> be closed, except Abu Bakr's door. <br /> <br />Some of the <b>Sunan</b> compilers recorded the Prophet saying that only Ali's door should remain open, but this is an error, what is in the <b>Sahih</b> is what is correct. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Muslim recorded that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said to me, <br /> <br />نَاوِلِيِني الْخُمْرَةَ مِنَ الْمَسْجِد <br /> <br />Bring me the garment from the <b>Masjid</b>. <br /> <br />I said, `I am having my period.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ حَيْضَتَكِ لَيْسَتْ فِي يَدِك <br /> <br />Your period is not in your hand. <br /> <br />Muslim also collected a similar narration from Abu Hurayrah. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> indicates that the woman is allowed to pass through the <b>Masjid</b> during menses or post-natal bleeding, and Allah knows best. <br /><b>Description of Tayammum</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاء أَحَدٌ مِّنكُم مِّن الْغَأيِطِ أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَاء فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا <br /> <br />and if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from the <b>Gha'it</b> (toilet), or from <b>Lamastum</b> (touching) women, but you do not find water, then perform <b>Tayammum</b> with clean earth. <br /> <br />As for the type of illness which would allow <b>Tayammum</b>, it is an illness that one fears would be aggravated by using water, which could be detrimental to a part of the body, or when doing so would prolong an illness. <br /> <br />Some scholars said that any type of illness warrants <b>Tayammum</b>, because of the general indications of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ <br /> <br />or on a journey, <br /> <br />As for traveling on a journey, it is known, regardless of its length. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />أَوْ جَاء أَحَدٌ مِّنكُم مِّن الْغَأيِطِ <br /> <br />or comes from the <b>Gha'it</b>, <br /> <br />The <b>Gha'it</b> is, literally, the flat land, and this part of the <b>Ayah</b> refers to the minor impurity. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء <br /> <br />or you <b>Lamastum</b> women, <br /> <br />which was recited <b>Lamastum</b> and <b>Lamastum</b>, referring to sexual intercourse. <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ <br /> <br />And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have appointed unto them the dowry, then pay half of that. (2&#59;237) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ الْمُوْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا <br /> <br />O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have touched them, no <b>`Iddah</b> (period of waiting) have you to count in respect of them. (33&#59;49) <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء <br /> (or <b>Lamastum</b> women) refers to sexual intercourse. <br /> <br />It was reported that Ali, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Mujahid, Tawus, Al-Hasan, Ubayd bin Umayr, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said similarly. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَاء فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا <br /> <br />but you do not find water, then perform <b>Tayammum</b> with clean earth, <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Imran bin Husayn said, <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger saw a person sitting away from the people and not praying with them. He asked him, <br /> <br />يَا فُلَانُ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تُصَلِّيَ مَعَ الْقَوْمِ أَلَسْتَ بِرَجُلٍ مُسْلِمٍ <br /> <br /> <br />`O so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people, are not you Muslim?' <br /> <br />He replied, `Yes, O Allah's Messenger! I am <b>Junub</b> and there is no water.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />عَلَيْكَ بِالصَّعِيدِ فَإِنَّهُ يَكْفِيك <br /> <br />`Perform <b>Tayammum</b> with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you.' <br /> <br />The <b>linguistic</b> meaning of <b>Tayammum</b> is to intend, as Arabs say, &#34;May Allah <b>Tayammamaka</b> (direct at you) His care.&#34; <br /> <br />`Clean earth' means dust. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَثٍ <br /> <br />جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَيِكَةِ <br /> <br />وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الاَْرْضُ كُلُّهَا مَسْجِدًا <br /> <br />وَجُعِلَتْ تُرْبَتُهَا لَنَا طَهُورًا إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء <br /> <br />We were given preference over people in three things. <br /> <br />Our lines (in prayer) were arranged in rows to resemble the rows of the angels, <br /> <br />all of the earth was made a <b>Masjid</b> for us, <br /> <br />and its dust was made clean for us when there is no water. <br /> <br />The Messenger mentioned the favor of making dust a purifier for us, and if there were any other substance to replace it for <b>Tayammum</b>, he would have mentioned it. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and the collectors of <b>Sunan</b>, with the exception of Ibn Majah, recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الصَّعِيدُ الطَّيِّبُ طَهُورُ الْمُسْلِمِ وَإِنْ لَمْ يَجِدِ الْمَاءَ عَشْرَ حِجَجٍ فَإِذَا وَجَدَهُ فَلْيُمِسَّهُ بَشَرَتَهُ فَإِنَّ ذَلِكَ خَيْر <br /> <br />Clean earth is pure for the Muslim, even if he does not find water for ten years. When he finds water, let him use it for his skin, for this is better. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>&#34;. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ <br /> <br />rubbing your faces and hands (<b>Tayammum</b>), <br /> <br />indicates that <b>Tayammum</b> is a substitute for normal ablution, not that it involves cleaning the parts that normal ablution does. Therefore, it is sufficient in <b>Tayammum</b> to just wipe the face and hands, as the consensus concurs. <br /> <br />The face and hands are wiped with one strike on the sand in this case, as Imam Ahmad recorded that; <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Abza said that a man came to Umar and asked him, &#34;I am <b>Junub</b>, but there is no water.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;Then, do not pray.&#34; <br /> <br />Ammar said, &#34;Do you not remember, O Leader of the Faithful! You and I were on a military expedition when we became Junub and did not find water. You did not pray, but I rolled myself in the sand and then prayed. When we went back to the Prophet, we mentioned to him what had happened. He said to me, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا كَانَ يَكْفِيك <br /> <br /> <br />This would have been sufficient for you, <br /> <br />and the Prophet stroked his hand on the earth once, blew into it and wiped his face and hands.&#34; <br /> <br />The Muslim <b>Ummah</b>, rather than all other nations, was favored with the allowance of <b>Tayammum</b>. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ قَبْلِي <br /> <br />نُصِرْتُ بِالرُّعْبِ مَسِيرَةَ شَهْرٍ وَجُعِلَتْ لِيَ الاَْرْضُ مَسْجِدًا وَطَهُورًا <br /> <br />فَأَيُّمَا رَجُلٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي أَدْرَكَتْهُ الصَّلَأةُ فَلْيُصَل <br /> <br />فَعِنْدَهُ طَهُورُهُ وَمَسْجِدُهُ <br /> <br />وَأُحِلَّتْ لِيَ الْغَنَايِمُ وَلَمْ تَحِلَّ لاِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي <br /> <br />وَأُعْطِيتُ الشَّفَاعَةَ وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلى قَوْمِهِ <br /> <br />وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة <br /> <br />I have been given five things which were not given to any (Prophet) before me&#59; <br /> <br />Allah made me victorious with fright that covers a month's distance. <br /> <br />The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and an object to perform purification with. Therefore let my followers pray wherever the time of a prayer is due - and in another narration - he will have his means of purity and his <b>Masjid</b>. <br /> <br />The spoils of war have been made lawful for me and it was not made so for anyone else before me. <br /> <br />I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively, but I have been sent to all mankind. <br /> <br />We also mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> of Hudhayfah that Muslim recorded; <br /> <br />فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَثٍ <br /> <br />جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَيِكَةِ <br /> <br />وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الاَْرْضُ مَسْجِدًا <br /> <br />وَتُرْبَتُهَا طَهُورًا إِذَا لَمْ نَجِدِ الْمَاء <br /> <br />We were preferred with three things over people. <br /> <br />Our lines (in prayer) were arranged in rows to resemble the rows of the angels, <br /> <br />all of the earth was made a <b>Masjid</b> for us, <br /> <br />and its dust was made clean for us when there is no water. <br /> <br />Allah said in this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />rubbing your faces and hands. Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. <br /> <br />meaning, a part of His pardoning and forgiving is that He allows you to use <b>Tayammum</b> and to pray after using it when there is no water, to make things easy for you. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> sanctifies the position of the prayer, it being too sacred than to be performed in a deficient manner, like in a state of drunkenness, until one becomes aware of what he is saying, or sexually impure, until he bathes (<b>Ghusl</b>), or after answering the call of nature, until he performs ablution. <br /> <br />There are exceptions when one is ill or when there is no water. In this case, Allah allows us to use <b>Tayammum</b>, out of His mercy and kindness for His servants, and to facilitate them, all praise is due to Allah. <br /><b>The Reason behind allowing Tayammum</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;We set out with Allah's Messenger on one of his journeys until we reached Al-Bayda' or Dhat-ul-Jaysh, where a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water source or any water with them at that place, so the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, `Don't you see what Aishah has done! She has made Allah's Messenger and the people stay where there is no source of water and they have no water with them.' <br /> <br />Abu Bakr came while Allah's Messenger was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said to me, `You have detained Allah's Messenger and the people where there is no source of water and they have no water with them.' <br /> <br />So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. <br /> <br />Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah's Messenger on my thigh. <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the verses of <b>Tayammum</b>, and they all performed <b>Tayammum</b>. <br /> <br />Usayd bin Hudayr said, `O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours.' <br /> <br />Then the camel on which I was riding was moved from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b></p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 42" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-42/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">43</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>43</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="An-Nisa Verse 44" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-44/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=43;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
