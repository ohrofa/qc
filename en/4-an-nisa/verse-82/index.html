Therefore, the Qur'an is the truth coming from the Truth, Allah. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />أَفَلَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْانَ أَمْ عَلَى قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا <br /> <br />Do they not then think deeply in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it). (47&#59;24) <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />Had it been from other than Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, had it been fraudulent and made up, as the ignorant idolators and hypocrites assert in their hearts. <br /> <br />لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ اخْتِلَفًا <br /> <br />they would surely, have found therein contradictions, <br /> <br />discrepancies and inconsistencies <br /> <br />كَثِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in abundance. <br /> <br />However, this Qur'an is free of shortcomings, and therefore, it is from Allah. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah describes those who are firmly grounded in knowledge, <br /> <br />ءَامَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا <br /> <br />We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord. (3&#59;7) <br /> <br />meaning, the <b>Muhkam</b> sections (entirely clear) and the <b>Mutashabih</b> sections (not entirely clear) of the Qur'an are all true. So they understand the not entirely clear from the clear, and thus gain guidance. <br /> <br />As for those in whose heart is the disease of hypocrisy, they understand the <b>Muhkam</b> from the <b>Mutashabih</b>; thus only gaining misguidance. <br /> <br />Allah praised those who have knowledge and criticized the wicked. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said, <br /> <br />&#34;I and my brother were present in a gathering, which is more precious to me than red camels. My brother and I came and found that some of the leaders of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were sitting close to a door of his. We did not like the idea of being separate from them, so we sat near the room. They then mentioned an <b>Ayah</b> and began disputing until they raised their voices. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah was so angry that when he went out his face was red. He threw sand on them and said to them, <br /> <br />مَهْلً يَا قَوْمِ بِهَذَا أُهْلِكَتِ الاُْمَمُ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ بِاخْتِلَفِهِمْ عَلى أَنْبِيَايِهِمْ وَضَرْبِهِمِ الْكُتُبَ بَعْضَهَا بِبَعْضٍ إِنَّ الْقُرْانَ لَمْ يَنْزِلْ يُكَذِّبُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا إِنَّمَا يُصَدِّقُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا فَمَا عَرَفْتُمْ مِنْهُ فَاعْمَلُوا بِهِ وَمَا جَهِلْتُمْ مِنْهُ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلى عَالِمِه <br /> <br />Behold, O people! This is how the nations before you were destroyed, because of their disputing with their Prophets and their contradicting parts of the Books with other parts. The Qur'an does not contradict itself. Rather, it testifies to the truth of itself. Therefore, whatever of it you have knowledge in, then implement it, and whatever you do not know of it, then refer it to those who have knowledge in it.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin `Amr said, <br /> <br />&#34;I went to the Messenger of Allah one day. When we were sitting, two men disputed about an <b>Ayah</b>, and their voices became loud. The Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا هَلَكَتِ الاُْمَمُ قَبْلَكُمْ بِاخْتِلَفِهِمْ فِي الْكِتَاب <br /> <br />Verily, the nations before you were destroyed because of their disagreements over the Book. <br /> <br />Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. <br /><b>The Prohibition of Disclosing Unreliable and Uninvestigated News</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 81" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-81/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">82</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>82</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 83" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-83/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
