At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan, Gharib</b>&#34;. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ali said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah sent a troop under the command of a man from <b>Al-Ansar</b>. When they left, he became angry with them for some reason and said to them, `Has not the Messenger of Allah commanded you to obey me?' <br /> <br />They said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />He said, `Collect some wood,' and then he started a fire with the wood, saying, `I command you to enter the fire.' <br /> <br />The people almost entered the fire, but a young man among them said, `You only ran away from the Fire to Allah's Messenger. Therefore, do not rush until you go back to Allah's Messenger, and if he commands you to enter it, then enter it.' <br /> <br />When they went back to Allah's Messenger, they told him what had happened, and the Messenger said, <br /> <br />لَوْ دَخَلْتُمُوهَا مَا خَرَجْتُمْ مِنْهَا أَبَدًا إِنَّمَا الطَّاعَةُ فِي الْمَعْرُوف <br /> <br />Had you entered it, you would never have departed from it. Obedience is only in righteousness.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Abdullah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />السَّمْعُ وَالطَّاعَةُ عَلَى الْمَرْءِ الْمُسْلِمِ فِيمَا أَحَبَّ وَكَرِهَ مَا لَمْ يُوْمَرْ بِمَعْصِيَةٍ فَإِذَا أُمِرَ بِمَعْصِيَةٍ فَلَ سَمْعَ وَلَا طَاعَة <br /> <br />The Muslim is required to hear and obey in that which he likes and dislikes, unless he was commanded to sin. When he is commanded with sin, then there is no hearing or obeying. <br /> <br />This Hadith is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Ubadah bin As-Samit said, <br /> <br />&#34;We gave our pledge to Allah's Messenger to hear and obey (our leaders), while active and otherwise, in times of ease and times of difficulty, even if we were deprived of our due shares, and to not dispute this matter (leadership) with its rightful people. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَنْ تَرَوْا كُفْرًا بَوَاحًا عِنْدَكُمْ فِيهِ مِنَ اللهِ بُرْهَان <br /> <br />Except when you witness clear <b>Kufr</b> about which you have clear proof from Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Another <b>Hadith</b> narrated by Anas states that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />اسْمَعُوا وَأَطِيعُوا وَإِنْ أُمِّرَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَبْدٌحَبَشِيٌّ كَأَنَّ رَأْسَهُ زَبِيبَة <br /> <br />Hear and obey (your leaders), even if an Ethiopian slave whose head is like a raisin, is made your chief. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Umm Al-Husayn said that she heard the Messenger of Allah giving a speech during the Farewell <b>Hajj</b>, in which he said; <br /> <br />وَلَوِ اسْتُعْمِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَبْدٌيَقُودُكُمْ بِكِتَابِ اللهِ اسْمَعُوا لَهُ وَأَطِيعُوا <br /> <br />Even if a slave was appointed over you, and he rules you with Allah's Book, then listen to him and obey him. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In another narration with Muslim, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />عَبْدًا حَبَشِيًّا مَجْدُوعًا <br /> <br />Even if an Ethiopian slave, whose nose was mutilated... <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللهَ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَقَدْ عَصَى اللهَ وَمَنْ أَطَاعَ أَمِيرِي فَقَدْ أَطَاعَنِي وَمَنْ عَصَى أَمِيرِي فَقَدْ عَصَانِي <br /> <br />Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah. Whoever obeys my commander, obeys me, and whoever disobeys my commander, disobeys me. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ <br /> <br />Obey Allah, <br /> <br />adhere to His Book. <br /> <br />وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ <br /> <br />and obey the Messenger, <br /> <br />adhere to his <b>Sunnah</b>. <br /> <br />وَأُوْلِي الَامْرِ مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />And those of you who are in authority. <br /> <br />in the obedience to Allah which they command you, not what constitutes disobedience of Allah, for there is no obedience to anyone in disobedience to Allah, as we mentioned in the authentic <b>Hadith</b>, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا الطَّاعَةُ فِي الْمَعْرُوف <br /> <br />Obedience is only in righteousness. <br /><b>The Necessity of Referring to the Qur'an and Sunnah for Judgment</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ <br /> <br />(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger. <br /> <br />Mujahid and several others among the <b>Salaf</b> said that the <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />&#34;(Refer) to the Book of Allah and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger.&#34; <br /> <br />This is a command from Allah that whatever areas the people dispute about, whether major or minor areas of the religion, they are required to refer to the Qur'an and <b>Sunnah</b> for judgment concerning these disputes. In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ <br /> <br />And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah. (42&#59;10) <br /> <br />Therefore, whatever the Book and <b>Sunnah</b> decide and testify to the truth of, then it, is the plain truth. What is beyond truth, save falsehood. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />إِن كُنتُمْ تُوْمِنُونَ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ <br /> <br />if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. <br /> <br />meaning, refer the disputes and conflicts that arise between you to the Book of Allah and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger for judgment. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />إِن كُنتُمْ تُوْمِنُونَ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ <br /></b> (if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day), indicates that those who do not refer to the Book and <b>Sunnah</b> for judgment in their disputes, are not believers in Allah or the Last Day. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ <br /> <br />That is better, <br /> <br />meaning, referring to the Book of Allah and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger for judgment in various disputes is better. <br /> <br />وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and more suitable for final determination. <br /> <br />As-Suddi and several others have stated, <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;Has a better end and destination.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Carries a better reward.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 58" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 60" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=59;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
