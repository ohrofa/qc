Talha al-Hajab, by force, upon the arrival of the Prophet (s) in Mecca in the year of the Conquest, after he [`Uthmn] had tried to prevent him [`Al from taking it] saying, `If I had known that he was the Messenger of God, I would not have prevented him'. The Messenger of God (s) then ordered him [`Al] to give it back to him [`Uthmn] saying to him, `Here you are, [it is yours] now and always'. He [`Uthmn] was amazed by this, whereupon `Al recited to him this verse, and he accepted Islam. Upon his death, he [`Uthmn] gave it [the key] to his brother, Shayba, and thus it remained in [the keep of] his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a specific occasion, it holds true in general on account of the plural person [to which it is addressed]. And when you judge between people, He commands, that you judge with justice. Excellent is (ni`imm, the mm of ni`ima has been assimilated with the indefinite particle m, which is the object described, in other words, na`ima shay'an, `an excellent thing [is]') the admonition God gives you, to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever Hearer, of what is said, Seer, of what is done.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Command to Return the Trusts to Whomever They Are Due</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُودُّواْ الَامَانَاتِ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا <br /> <br />Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due; <br /> <br />Allah commands that the trusts be returned to their rightful owners. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan narrated that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَدِّ الاَْمَانَةَ إِلى مَنِ ايْتَمَنَكَ وَلَا تَخُنْ مَنْ خَانَك <br /> <br />Return the trust to those who entrusted you, and do not betray those who betrayed you. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and the collectors of <b>Sunan</b> recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />This command refers to all things that one is expected to look after, such as Allah's rights on His servants&#59; <br /> <br />praying, <br /><b>Zakah</b>, <br /> <br />fasting, <br /> <br />penalties for sins, <br /> <br />vows and so forth. <br /> <br />The command also includes <br /> <br />the rights of the servants on each other, such as what they entrust each other with, including the cases that are not recorded or documented. <br /> <br />Allah commands that all types of trusts be fulfilled. Those who do not implement this command in this life, it will be extracted from them on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَتُوَدَّنَّ الْحُقُوقُ إِلى أَهْلِهَا حَتَّى يُقْتَصَّ لِلشَّاةِ الْجَمَّاءِ مِنَ الْقَرْنَاء <br /> <br />The rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due, and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said about this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;It was revealed concerning Uthman bin Talhah from whom the Messenger of Allah took the key of the <b>Ka`bah</b> and entered it on the Day of the victory of Makkah. When the Prophet went out, he was reciting this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُودُّواْ الَامَانَاتِ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا <br /> (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). <br /> <br />He then called Uthman and gave the key back to him.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir also narrated that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah went out of the <b>Ka`bah</b>, he was reciting this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُودُّواْ الَامَانَاتِ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا <br /> (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). <br /> <br />May I sacrifice my father and mother for him, I never heard him recite this <b>Ayah</b> before that.&#34; <br /> <br />It is popular that this is the reason behind revealing the <b>Ayah</b> (4&#59;58). Yet, the application of the <b>Ayah</b> is general, and this is why Ibn Abbas and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> is for the righteous and wicked,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning it is a command that encompasses everyone. <br /><b>The Order to Be Just</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُم بَيْنَ النَّاسِ أَن تَحْكُمُواْ بِالْعَدْلِ <br /> <br />and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. <br /> <br />commanding justice when judging between people. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ka`b, Zayd bin Aslam and Shahr bin Hawshab said; <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about those in authority&#34;, <br /> <br />meaning those who judge between people. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ مَعَ الْحَاكِمِ مَا لَمْ يَجُرْ فَإِذَا جَارَ وَكَلَهُ اللهُ إِلى نَفْسِه <br /> <br />Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit injustice, for when he does, Allah will make him reliant on himself. <br /> <br />A statement goes, <br /> <br />&#34;One day of justice equals forty years of worship.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُم بِهِ <br /> <br />Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you! <br /> <br />meaning, His commands to return the trusts to their owners, to judge between people with justice, and all of His complete, perfect and great commandments and laws. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer. <br /> <br />means, He hears your statements and knows your actions</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 57" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">58</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>58</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 59" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
