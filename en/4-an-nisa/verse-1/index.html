Surely God has been watchful over you, heedful of your deeds, for which He will requite you, that is to say, He is ever possessed of such an attribute.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Command to have Taqwa, a Reminder about Creation, and Being Kind to Relatives</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ <br /> <br /> <br />O mankind! Have <b>Taqwa</b> of your Lord, Who created you from a single person, <br /> <br />Allah commands His creatures to have <b>Taqwa</b> of Him by worshipping Him Alone without partners. <br /> <br />He also reminds to them of His ability, in that He created them all from a single person, Adam, peace be unto him. <br /> <br />وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا <br /> <br />And from him He created his wife, <br /> <br />Hawwa' (Eve), who was created from Adam's left rib, from his back while he was sleeping. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa', he liked her and had affection for her, and she felt the same toward him. <br /> <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الْمَرْأَةَ خُلِقَتْ مِنْنِضلَعٍ وَإِنَّ أَعْوَجَ شَيْءٍ فِي الضِّلَعِ أَعْلَهُ فَإِنْ ذَهَبْتَ تُقِيمُهُ كَسَرْتَهُ وَإِنِ اسْتَمْتَعْتَ بِهَا اسْتَمْتَعْتَ بِهَا وَفِيهَا عِوَج <br /> <br />Woman was created from a rib. Verily, the most curved portion of the rib is its upper part, so, if you should try to straighten it, you will break it, but if you leave it as it is, it will remain crooked. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالاً كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاء <br /> <br />And from them both He created many men and women; <br /> <br />means, Allah created from Adam and Hawwa' many men and women and distributed them throughout the world in various shapes, characteristics, colors and languages. In the end, their gathering and return will be to Allah. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءلُونَ بِهِ وَالَارْحَامَ <br /> <br />And have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and revere the wombs, <br /> <br />protect yourself from Allah by your acts of obedience to Him. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />الَّذِي تَسَاءلُونَ بِهِ <br /> (through Whom you demand your mutual (rights)), <br /> <br />According to Ibrahim, Mujahid and Al-Hasan, <br /> <br />is in reference to when some people say, &#34;I ask you by Allah, and then by the relation of the <b>Rahim</b> (the womb, i.e. my relationship to you).&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said; <br /> <br />&#34;Fear Allah Whom you invoke when you conduct transactions and contracts.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi, and others have stated, <br /> <br />&#34;And revere the womb by not cutting the relations of the womb, but keep and honor them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is always watching over you. <br /> <br />means, He watches all your deeds and sees your every circumstance. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ <br /> <br />And Allah is Witness over all things. (58&#59;6) <br /> <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />اعْبُدِاللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك <br /> <br />Worship Allah as if you see Him, for even though you cannot see Him, He sees you. <br /> <br />This part of the <b>Ayah</b> encourages having a sense of certainty that Allah is always watching, in a complete and perfect manner. <br /> <br />Allah mentioned that He has created mankind from a single father and a single mother, so that they feel compassion for each other and are kind to the weaker among them. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Muslim recorded that Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali said that; <br /> <br />a delegation from Mudar came to the Messenger of Allah, and he saw their state, wearing striped woolen clothes due to poverty. After the <b>Zuhr</b> prayer, the Messenger of Allah stood up and gave a speech in which he recited, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ <br /></b> (O mankind! Have <b>Taqwa</b> of your Lord, Who created you from a single person), until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. He also recited, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ <br /></b> (O you who believe! Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the tomorrow). (59&#59;18) <br /> <br />He also encouraged them to give charity, saying, <br /> <br />تَصَدَّقَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ دِينَارِهِ مِنْ دِرْهَمِهِ مِنْ صَاعِ بُرِّهِ مِنْ صَاعِ تَمْرِه <br /> <br />A man gave <b>Sadaqah</b> from his Dinar, from his Dirham, from his <b>Sa`</b> of wheat, from his <b>Sa`</b> of dates... until the end of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />This narration was also collected by Ahmad and the <b>Sunan</b> compilers from Ibn Mas`ud</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>1</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 2" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=1;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
