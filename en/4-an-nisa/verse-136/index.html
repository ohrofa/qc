Believe in Allah, and His Messenger, <br /> <br />Allah commands His faithful servants to adhere to all the elements of faith, its branches, pillars and cornerstones. This is not stated as mere redundancy, but from the view of completing faith and the continual maintenance of it. <br /> <br />For instance, the believer proclaims in every prayer, <b> <br />اهدِنَــــا الصِّرَاطَ المُستَقِيم <br /></b> (Guide us to the straight way) which means, make us aware of the straight path and increase us in guidance and strengthen us on it. <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b> Allah commands the believers to believe in Him and in His Messenger, just as He said elsewhere, <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَءَامِنُواْ بِرَسُولِهِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah, and believe in His Messenger. (57&#59;28) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ <br /> <br />and the Book which He has sent down to His Messenger, <br /> <br />refers to the Qur'an, <br /> <br />while, <br /> <br />وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِيَ أَنزَلَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); <br /> <br />refers to the previously revealed divine Books. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِاللّهِ وَمَلَيِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَلاً بَعِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away. <br /> <br />meaning, he will have deviated from the correct guidance and strayed far away from its path</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 135" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-135/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">136</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>136</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 137" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-137/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
