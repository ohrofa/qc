They thus, out of exaggeration and extremism in the religion, prohibited some things for themselves. <br /> <br />It could also mean that in the <b>Tawrah</b>, Allah prohibited things that were allowed for them before. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُّ الطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِـلًّ لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ إِلاَّ مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَءِيلُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ التَّوْرَاةُ <br /> <br />All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israil made unlawful for himself before the <b>Tawrah</b> was revealed. (3;93) <br /> <br />We mentioned this <b>Ayah</b> before, which means that all types of food were allowed for the Children of Israel before the <b>Tawrah</b> was revealed, except the camel's meat and milk that Israil prohibited for himself. Later, Allah prohibited many things in the Tawrah. Allah said in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b> (chapter 6), <br /> <br />وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ وَالْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَأ إِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَأ أَوِ الْحَوَايَأ أَوْ مَا اخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ ذَلِكَ جَزَيْنَـهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ <br /> <br />And unto those who are Jews, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone. Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion. And verily, We are Truthful. (6&#59;146) <br /> <br />This means, We prohibited these things for them because they deserved it due to their transgression, injustice, defying their Messenger and disputing with him. <br /> <br />So Allah said; <br /> <br />فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَاتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ <br /> <br />وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللّهِ كَثِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br />For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful to them certain good foods which had been lawful to them, and for their hindering many from Allah's way. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> states that they hindered themselves and others from following the truth, and this is the behavior that they brought from the past to the present. <br /> <br />This is why they were and still are the enemies of the Messengers, killing many of the Prophets. They also denied Muhammad and `Isa, peace be upon them. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 159" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-159/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">160</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>160</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 161" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-161/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
