(3&#59;152) <br /> <br />meaning, by His command, decree, will and because He granted you superiority over them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ جَأوُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُواْ اللّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ <br /> <br />If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you and begged Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them, <br /> <br />directs the sinners and evildoers, when they commit errors and mistakes, to come to the Messenger, so that they ask Allah for forgiveness in his presence and ask him to supplicate to Allah to forgive them. If they do this, Allah will forgive them and award them His mercy and pardon. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />لَوَجَدُواْ اللّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />indeed, they would have found Allah All-Forgiving (One Who forgives and accepts repentance), Most Merciful. <br /><b>One Does not Become a Believer Unless He Refers to the Messenger for Judgment and Submits to his Decisions</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 63" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-63/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">64</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>64</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 65" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-65/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
