If they had referred it, the news, to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, that is, the judicious elders among the Companions, in other words, if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out, [those who] follow it up and seek knowledge of it, the ones who broadcast it, would have known it, and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not, from them, from the Prophet (s) and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you, through Islam, and His mercy, to you through the Qur'n, you would surely have followed Satan, in the abominations to which he commands you, except a few [of you].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الَامْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); <br /> <br />chastising those who indulge in things before being sure of their truth, disclosing them, making them known and spreading their news, even though such news might not be true at all. <br /> <br />In the introduction to his <b>Sahih</b>, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />كَفَى بِالْمَرْءِ كَذِبًا أَنْ يُحَدِّثَ بِكُلِّ مَا سَمِع <br /> <br />Narrating everything one hears is sufficient to make a person a liar. <br /> <br />This is the same narration collected by Abu Dawud in the section of <b>Adab</b> (manners) in his <b>Sunan</b>. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said that the Messenger of Allah prohibited, <br /> <br />&#34;It was said,&#34; and, &#34;So-and-so said.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> refers to those who often convey the speech that people utter without investigating the reliability and truth of what he is disclosing. <br /> <br />The <b>Sahih</b> also records, <br /> <br />مَنْ حَدَّثَ بِحَدِيثٍ وَهُوَ يُرَى أَنَّهُ كَذِبٌ فَهُوَ أَحَدُ الْكَاذِبَيْن <br /> <br />Whoever narrates a <b>Hadith</b> while knowing it is false, then he is one of the two liars (who invents and who spreads the lie). <br /> <br />We should mention here the <b>Hadith</b> of Umar bin Al-Khattab collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />When Umar was informed that the Messenger of Allah divorced his wives, he came from his house, entered the <b>Masjid</b> and found the people talking about this news. He could not wait and went to the Prophet to ask him about what had truly happened, asking him, &#34;Have you divorced your wives?&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;I said, <b>Allahu Akbar</b>...&#34; and mentioned the rest of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In the narration that Muslim collected, Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked, `Have you divorced them?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />So, I stood by the door of the <b>Masjid</b> and shouted with the loudest voice, `The Messenger of Allah did not divorce his wives.' <br /> <br />Then, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الَامْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى أُوْلِي الَامْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). <br /> <br />So I properly investigated that matter.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> refers to proper investigation, or extraction of matters from their proper resources. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ <br /> <br />Had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, <br /> <br />لَاتَّبَعْتُمُ الشَّيْطَانَ إِلااَّ قَلِيلاً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />you would have followed <b>Shaytan</b> except a few of you. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />refers to the believers.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 82" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>83</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa&#39; Verse 84" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
