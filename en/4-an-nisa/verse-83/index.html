He could not wait and went to the Prophet to ask him about what had truly happened, asking him, &#34;Have you divorced your wives?&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;I said, <b>Allahu Akbar</b>...&#34; and mentioned the rest of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In the narration that Muslim collected, Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked, `Have you divorced them?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />So, I stood by the door of the <b>Masjid</b> and shouted with the loudest voice, `The Messenger of Allah did not divorce his wives.' <br /> <br />Then, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الَامْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى أُوْلِي الَامْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). <br /> <br />So I properly investigated that matter.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> refers to proper investigation, or extraction of matters from their proper resources. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ <br /> <br />Had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, <br /> <br />لَاتَّبَعْتُمُ الشَّيْطَانَ إِلااَّ قَلِيلاً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />you would have followed <b>Shaytan</b> except a few of you. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />refers to the believers.</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 82" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النساء<span class="num-ar">4</span> :<span class="num-ar">83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nisa'<span> 4</span>:<span>83</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nisa Verse 84" href="/en/4-an-nisa/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=4,sura_dir="an-nisa",count_ayat=176,number_aya=83;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
