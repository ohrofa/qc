So he must treat them with the utmost kindness and respect, his father for spending on him and his mother because of her compassion for him. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلَهُمَا فَلَ تَقُل لَّهُمَأ أُفٍّ وَلَا تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلاً كَرِيمًا <br /> <br /> وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ وَقُل رَّبِّ ارْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِى صَغِيرًا <br /> <br />And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honor. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say&#59;&#34;My Lord! Bestow on them Your mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.&#34; (17&#59;23-24) <br /> <br />Although Allah orders us to show kindness, mercy and respect towards them in return for their previous kindness, He says&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ لِتُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَإ تُطِعْهُمَا <br /> <br />but if they strive to make associate with Me, which you have no knowledge of, then obey them not. <br /> <br />meaning, if they are idolators, and they try to make you follow them in their religion, then beware of them, and do not obey them in that, for you will be brought back to Me on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will reward you for your kindness towards them and your patience in adhering to your religion. <br /> <br />إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do. <br /> <br />It is Allah Who will gather you with the group of the righteous, not with the group of your parents, even though you were the closest of people to them in the world. For a person will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection with those whom he loves, meaning, religious love. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ امَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَنُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ فِي الصَّالِحِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 7" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> العنكبوت<span class="num-ar">29</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-'Ankabut<span> 29</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 9" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=29,sura_dir="al-ankabut",count_ayat=69,number_aya=8;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
