Then God delivered him from the fire, into which they threw him, by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that, namely, [in that] deliverance of him from it, there are signs -- namely, the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness, and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place -- for a people who believe, [a people who] affirm the truth of God's Oneness and His power, for they are the ones to benefit from these [signs].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Response of Ibrahim's People -- and how Allah controlled the Fire</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ <br /> <br />So nothing was the answer of people, <br /> <br />Allah tells us how Ibrahim's people stubbornly and arrogantly disbelieved, and how they resisted the truth with falsehood. After Ibrahim addressed them with his words of clear guidance, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوا اقْتُلُوهُ أَوْ حَرِّقُوهُ <br /> <br />except that they said&#59;&#34;Kill him or burn him.&#34; <br /> <br />This was because proof had clearly been established against them, so they resorted to using their power and strength. <br /> <br />قَالُواْ ابْنُواْ لَهُ بُنْيَـناً فَأَلْقُوهُ فِى الْجَحِيمِ <br /> <br />فَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَـهُمُ الاٌّسْفَلِينَ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;Build for him a building and throw him into the blazing fire!&#34; So they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest. (37&#59;97-98) <br /> <br />They spent a long time gathering a huge amount of firewood, they built a fence around it, then they set it ablaze until its flames reached up to the sky. No greater fire had ever been lit. Then they went to Ibrahim, seized him and put him into a catapult, then they threw him into the fire. But Allah made it cool and safe for him, and after spending several days in it, he emerged unscathed. For this reason and others, Allah made him an <b>Imam</b> for mankind, for he offered himself to the Most Merciful, he offered his body to the flames, he offered his son as a sacrifice, and he gave his wealth to care for his guests. For all of these reasons he is beloved by the followers of all religions. <br /> <br />فَأَنجَاهُ اللَّهُ مِنَ النَّارِ <br /> <br />Then Allah saved him from the fire. <br /> <br />means, He rescued him from it by making it cool and safe for him. <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe. <br /> <br />Ibrahim, peace be upon him, explains to his people that idols are incapable of doing anything</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 23" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> العنكبوت<span class="num-ar">29</span> :<span class="num-ar">24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-'Ankabut<span> 29</span>:<span>24</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 25" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
