Only a few of them believed with him. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَبِثَ فِيهِمْ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلاَّ خَمْسِينَ عَامًا فَأَخَذَهُمُ الطُّوفَانُ وَهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years; and the Deluge overtook them while they were wrongdoers. <br /> <br />meaning, `after this long period of time, when the Message and the warning had been of no avail, so, O Muhammad, do not feel sorry because of those among your people who disbelieve in you, and do not grieve for them, for Allah guides whomsoever He wills and leaves astray whomsoever He wills. The matter rests with Him and all things will return to Him.' <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br />وَلَوْ جَأءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ <br /> <br />Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe, even if every sign should come to them. (10&#59;96-97) <br /> <br />Know that Allah will help you and support you and cause you to prevail, and He will defeat and humiliate your enemies, and make them the lowest of the low. <br /> <br />It was recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Nuh received his mission when he was forty years old, and he stayed among his people for a thousand years less fifty; after the Flood he lived for sixty years until people had increased and spread.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 13" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> العنكبوت<span class="num-ar">29</span> :<span class="num-ar">14</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-'Ankabut<span> 29</span>:<span>14</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 15" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
