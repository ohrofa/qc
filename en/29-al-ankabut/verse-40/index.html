It carried them through the air, lifting a man up to the sky and then hurling him headlong to the ground, so that his head split and he was left as a body without a head, like uprooted stems of date palms. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَخَذَتْهُ الصَّيْحَةُ <br /> <br />and of them were some who were overtaken by <b>As-Sayhah</b>, <br /> <br />This is what happened to <b>Thamud</b>, against whom evidence was established because of the she-camel who came forth when the rock was split, exactly as they had asked for. Yet despite that they did not believe, rather they persisted in their evil behavior and disbelief, and threatening to expel Allah's Prophet <b>Salih</b> and the believers with him, or to stone them. So the <b>Sayhah</b> struck them, taking away their powers of speech and movement. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ خَسَفْنَا بِهِ الاَْرْضَ <br /> <br />and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow, <br /> <br />This refers to <b>Qarun</b> who transgressed, he was evil and arrogant. He disobeyed his Lord, the Most High, and paraded through the land in a boastful manner, filled with self-admiration, thinking that he was better than others. He showed off as he walked, so Allah caused the earth to swallow him and his house, and he will continue sinking into it until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَغْرَقْنَا <br /> <br />and of them were some whom We drowned. <br /> <br />This refers to <b>Fir`awn</b>, his minister <b>Haman</b> and their troops, all of whom were drowned in a single morning, not one of them escaped. <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ <br /> <br />It was not Allah Who wronged them, <br /> <br />in what He did to them, <br /> <br />وَلَكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but they wronged themselves. <br /> <br />that happened to them as a punishment for what they did with their own hands</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-&#39;Ankabut Verse 39" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-39/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> العنكبوت<span class="num-ar">29</span> :<span class="num-ar">40</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-'Ankabut<span> 29</span>:<span>40</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-&#39;Ankabut Verse 41" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-41/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=29,sura_dir="al-ankabut",count_ayat=69,number_aya=40;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
