When a test or trial comes in this world, they think that this is a punishment from Allah, so they leave Islam. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ امَنَّا بِاللَّهِ فَإِذَا أُوذِيَ فِي اللَّهِ جَعَلَ فِتْنَةَ النَّاسِ كَعَذَابِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />Of mankind are some who say&#59;&#34;We believe in Allah.&#34; But if they are made to suffer for Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah's punishment; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Meaning that their trial is leaving Islam if they are made to suffer for Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of others among the <b>Salaf</b>. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is like the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ <br /> <br />And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge&#59;if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face... until&#59; <br /> <br />ذلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلَـلُ الْبَعِيدُ <br /> <br />That is a straying far away. (22&#59;11-12) <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَيِن جَاء نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ <br /> <br />and if victory comes from your Lord, they will say&#59;&#34;Verily, we were with you.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;if victory comes from your Lord, O Muhammad, and there are spoils of war, these people will say to you, `We were with you,' i.e., we are your brothers in faith.&#34; <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَكُنْ مَّعَكُمْ وَإِن كَانَ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُمْ مِّنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />Those who wait and watch about you; if you gain a victory from Allah, they say&#59;&#34;Were we not with you&#34; But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them)&#59;&#34;Did we not gain mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers&#34;. (4&#59;141) <br /> <br />فَعَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِالْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَيُصْبِحُواْ عَلَى مَأ أَسَرُّواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ نَـدِمِينَ <br /> <br />Perhaps Allah may bring a victory or a decision according to His will. Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves. (5&#59;52) <br /> <br />And Allah tells us about them here&#59; <br />وَلَيِن جَاء نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ <br /> (and if victory comes from your Lord, they will say&#59;&#34;Verily, we were with you.&#34;) <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَوَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِمَا فِي صُدُورِ الْعَالَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breasts of the creatures! <br /> <br />meaning, `does Allah not know best what is in their hearts and what they store secretly within themselves, even though outwardly they may appear to be in agreement with you!' <br /> <br />وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 9" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> العنكبوت<span class="num-ar">29</span> :<span class="num-ar">10</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-'Ankabut<span> 29</span>:<span>10</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ankabut Verse 11" href="/en/29-al-ankabut/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
