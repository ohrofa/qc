He examines them to see which of them will be best in deeds. This is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ <br /> <br />How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. (2&#59;28) <br /> <br />In this Ayah Allah named the first stage, which is non-existence, &#34;death.&#34; Then he named the origin or beginning of existence, &#34;life.&#34; <br /> <br />This is why Allah says, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ <br /> <br />Then He will give death, then again will bring you to life ( on the Day of Resurrection) (2&#59;28) <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلً <br /> <br />He may test you which of you is best in deed. <br /> <br />it means best in deeds. <br /> <br />This is as Muhammad bin `Ajlan said. <br /> <br />It should be noted that Allah did not say &#34;which of you does the most deeds.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving. <br /> <br />This means that He is the Almighty, the Most Great, the Most Powerful and the Most Honorable. However, along with this He is Most Forgiving to whoever turns to Him in repentance and seeks His pardon after having disobeyed Him and opposed His commandment. Even though Allah is Almighty, He also forgives, shows mercy, pardons and excuses. <br /> <br />Then Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mulk Verse 1" href="/en/67-al-mulk/verse-1/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الملك<span class="num-ar">67</span> :<span class="num-ar">2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mulk<span> 67</span>:<span>2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Tabarak, Tabarak Aladhee Biyedihi Al-Mulk, Al-Mani', Al-Munjiyya</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mulk Verse 3" href="/en/67-al-mulk/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=67,sura_dir="al-mulk",count_ayat=30,number_aya=2;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
