For instance, according to Ibn Abdul-Barr and Al-Bayhaqi this is the opinion of; <br /> <br />- Abu Hurayrah <br /> <br />- Ibn Umar <br /> <br />- Ibn Abbas <br /> <br />- Muawiyah <br /> <br />- Umar <br /> <br />- Ali <br /> <br />Also, the Four Khalifah - as Al-Khatib reported - were said to have held this view although the report from them is contradicted. <br /> <br />The Tabi`in scholars who gave this Tafsir include <br /> <br />- Sa`id bin Jubayr <br /> <br />- Ikrimah <br /> <br />- Abu Qilabah <br /> <br />- Az-Zuhri <br /> <br />- Ali bin Al-Hasan, his son Muhammad <br /> <br />- Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib <br /> <br />- Ata' <br /> <br />- Tawus <br /> <br />- Mujahid <br /> <br />- Salim <br /> <br />- Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi <br /> <br />- Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr bin Hazm <br /> <br />- Abu Wa'il <br /> <br />- Ibn Sirin <br /> <br />- Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir <br /> <br />- Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas, his son Muhammad <br /> <br />- Nafi` the freed slave of Ibn Umar <br /> <br />- Zayd bin Aslam <br /> <br />- Umar bin Abdul-Aziz <br /> <br />- Al-Azraq bin Qays <br /> <br />- Habib bin Abi Thabit <br /> <br />- Abu Ash-Sha`tha' <br /> <br />- Makhul <br /> <br />- Abdullah bin Ma`qil bin Muqarrin <br /> <br />Also, Al-Bayhaqi added to this list; <br /> <br />- Abdullah bin Safwan <br /> <br />- Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah <br /> <br />In addition, Ibn Abdul-Barr added <br /> <br />- `Amr bin Dinar <br /> <br />The proof that these scholars relied on is that, since Bismillah is a part of Al-Fatihah, it should be recited aloud like the rest of Al-Fatihah. <br /> <br />Also, An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khuzaymah in their Sahihs and Al-Hakim in the Mustadrak, that Abu Hurayrah once performed the prayer and recited Bismillah aloud. After he finished the prayer, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;Among you, I perform the prayer that is the closest to the prayer of the Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Khatib and Al-Bayhaqi graded this <b>Hadith Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Furthermore, in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that Anas bin Malik was asked about the recitation of the Prophet. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;His recitation was unhurried.&#34; <br /> <br />He then demonstrated that and recited, while lengthening the recitation of <b>Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim</b>, <br /> <br />Also, in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, the Sunan of Abu Dawud, the Sahih of Ibn Hibban and the Mustadrak of Al-Hakim - it is recorded that Umm Salamah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah used to distinguish each Ayah during his recitation, <br /> <br />بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ <br /> <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ <br /> <br /> <br />مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ <br /> <br /> <br />In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists, <br /> <br />the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />The Owner of the Day of Recompense.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Daraqutni graded the chain of narration for this <b>Hadith Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Imam Abu Abdullah Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, recorded that; <br /> <br />Mu`awiyah led the prayer in Al-Madinah and did not recite the Bismillah. The Muhajirin who were present at that prayer criticized that. When Mu`awiyah led the following prayer, he recited the Bismillah aloud. <br /> <br />The Hadiths mentioned above provide sufficient proof for the opinion that the Bismillah is recited aloud. <br /> <br />As for the opposing evidences and the scientific analysis of the narrations mentioned their weaknesses or otherwise it is not our desire to discuss this subject at this time. <br /> <br />Other scholars stated that the Bismillah should not be recited aloud in the prayer, and this is the established practice of the Four Khalifah, as well as Abdullah bin Mughaffal and several scholars among the Tabi`in and later generations. <br /> <br />It is also the Madhhab (view) of Abu Hanifah, Ath-Thawri and Ahmad bin Hanbal. <br /> <br />Imam Malik stated that the Bismillah is not recited aloud or silently. This group based their view upon what Imam Muslim recorded that <br /> <br />`A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah used to start the prayer by reciting the <b>Takbir</b> (<b>Allahu Akbar</b>; Allah is Greatest) and then recite, <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. (Ibn Abi Hatim 1&#59;2). <br /> <br />Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Anas bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;I prayed behind the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and they used to start their prayer with, <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. <br /> <br />Muslim added, <br /> <br />&#34;And they did not mention, <b> <br />بِسْمِ اللّهِ الرَّحْمـَنِ الرَّحِيم <br /></b> (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) whether in the beginning or the end of the recitation.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar is recorded in the Sunan books from Abdullah bin Mughaffal, (may Allah be pleased with him). <br /> <br />These are the opinions held by the respected Imams, and their statements are similar in that they agree that the prayer of those who recite Al-Fatihah aloud or in secret is correct. All the favor is from Allah. <br /><b>The Virtue of Al-Fatihah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad, that a person who was riding behind the Prophet said, &#34;The Prophet's animal tripped, so I said, `Cursed <b>Shaytan</b>.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَقُلْ تَعِسَ الشَّيْطَانُ فَإِنَّكَ إِذَا قُلْتَ تَعِسَ الشَّيْطَانُ تَعَاظَمَ وَقَالَ بِقُوَّتِي صَرَعْتُهُ <br /> <br /> <br />وَإِذَا قُلْتَ بِاسْمِ اللهِ تَصَاغَرَ حَتى يَصِيرَ مِثْلَ الذُبَابِ <br /> <br /> <br />Do not say, 'Cursed Shaytan,' for if you say these words, Satan becomes arrogant and says, 'With my strength I made him fall.' <br /> <br />When you say, 'Bismillah,' Satan will become as small as a fly. <br /> <br />Further, An-Nasa'i recorded in his book Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and also Ibn Marduwyah in his <b>Tafsir</b> that Usamah bin Umayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was riding behind the Prophet...&#34; and he mentioned the rest of the above Hadith. <br /> <br />The Prophet said in this narration, <br /> <br />لَاا تَقُلْ هكَذَا فَإِنَّهُ يَتَعَاظَمُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالْبَيْتِ <br /> <br /> <br />وَلكِنْ قُلْ بِسْمِ اللهِ فَإنَّهُ يَصْغَرُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالذُبَابَةِ <br /> <br /> <br />Do not say these words, because then Satan becomes larger; as large as a house. <br /> <br />Rather, say, 'Bismillah,' because Satan then becomes as small as a fly. <br /> <br />This is the blessing of reciting Bismillah. <br /><b>Basmalah is recommended before performing any Deed</b> <br /> <br />Basmalah (reciting <b>Bismillah</b>) is recommended before starting any action or deed. For instance, <br /> <br />- <b>Basmalah</b> is recommended before starting a <b>Khutbah</b> (speech). <br /> <br />- The <b>Basmalah</b> is also recommended before one enters the place where he wants to relieve himself, there is a <b>Hadith</b> concerning this practice. <br /> <br />- Further, <b>Basmalah</b> is recommended at the beginning of ablution, for Imam Ahmad and the <b>Sunan</b> compilers recorded that Abu Hurayrah, Sa`id bin Zayd and Abu Sa`id narrated from the Prophet,<b>لَا وُضُوءَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ</b> (There is no valid ablution for he who did not mention Allah's Name in it). <br /> <br />This Hadith is <b>Hasan</b> (good). <br /> <br />Also, the Basmalah is recommended before eating, for Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said to Umar bin Abi Salamah while he was a child under his care, <br /> <br />قُلْ بِسْمِ اللهِ وَكُلْ بِيَمِينِكَ وَكُلْ مِمَّا يَلِيكَ <br /> <br /> <br />- Say <b>Bismillah</b>, <br /> <br />- eat with your right hand and <br /> <br />- eat from whatever is next to you. <br /> <br />Some of the scholars stated that Basmalah before eating is obligatory. <br /> <br />Basmalah before having sexual intercourse is also recommended. The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that Ibn Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَهْلَهُ قَالَ <br /> <br /> <br />بِسْمِ اللهِ اللَهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا <br /> <br /> <br />فَإنَّهُ إِنْ يُقَدَّرْ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَدٌ لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَبَدًا <br /> <br /> <br />If anyone of you before having sexual relations with his wife says, <br /> <br />'In the Name of Allah. <br /> <br />O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you grant us (meaning the coming offspring) from Satan,' <br /> <br />and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm that child. <br /><b>The Meaning of &#34;Allah&#34;</b> <br /> <br />Allah is the Name of the Lord, the Exalted. <br /> <br />It is said that Allah is the Greatest Name of Allah, because it is referred to when describing Allah by the various attributes. <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لَا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br />هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لَا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلَـمُ الْمُوْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَأءُ الْحُسْنَى يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br />He is Allah, beside Whom <b>La ilaha illa Huwa</b> (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />He is Allah, beside Whom <b>La ilaha illa Huwa</b>, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects, the Giver of security, the Watcher over His creatures, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supreme. Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him. <br /> <br />He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise. (59&#59;22-24) <br /> <br />Hence, Allah mentioned several of His Names as Attributes for His Name Allah. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَللَّهِ الَاسْمَأءُ الْحُسْنَى فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا <br /> <br /> <br />And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them. (7&#59;180) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَأءَ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br /> <br />Say (O Muhammad)&#59;&#34;Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names.&#34; (17&#59;110) <br /> <br />Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ للهِ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا مِايَةً إِلَا وَاحِدًا مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ <br /> <br /> <br />Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred minus one, whoever counts (and preserves) them, will enter Paradise. <br /> <br />These Names were mentioned in a Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and there are several differences between these two narrations. <br /><b>The Meaning of Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim - the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</b> <br /><b>Ar-Rahman</b> and <b>Ar-Rahim</b> are two names derived from <b>Ar-Rahmah</b> (the mercy), but <b>Rahman</b> has more meanings that pertain to mercy than <b>Ar-Rahim</b>. <br /> <br />There is a statement by Ibn Jarir that indicates that there is a consensus on this meaning. <br /> <br />Further, Al-Qurtubi said, <br /> <br />&#34;The proof that these names are derived (from <b>Ar-Rahmah</b>), is what At-Tirmidhi recorded - and graded Sahih from Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, <br /> <br />قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى <br /> <br /> <br />أَنَا الرَّحْمنُ خَلَقْتُ الرَّحِمَ وَشَقَقْتُ لَهَا اسْمًا مِنِ اسْمِي فَمَنْ وَصَلَهَا وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَها قَطَعْتُهُ <br /> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />'I Am <b>Ar-Rahman</b>. I created the <b>Raham</b> (womb, i.e. family relations) and derived a name for it from My Name. Hence, whoever keeps it, I will keep ties to him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties with him.' <br /> <br />He then said, &#34;This is a text that indicates the derivation.&#34; <br /> <br />He then said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Arabs denied the name <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, because of their ignorance about Allah and His attributes.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Qurtubi said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was said that both <b>Ar-Rahman</b> and <b>Ar-Rahim</b> have the same meaning, such as the words <b>Nadman</b> and <b>Nadim</b>, as Abu Ubayd has stated.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Ali Al-Farisi said, <br /><b>`Ar-Rahman</b>, which is exclusively for Allah, is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah has. <b>Ar-Rahim</b> is what effects the believers, for Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً <br /> <br /> <br />And He is ever <b>Rahim</b> (merciful) to the believers.' (33&#59;43) <br /> <br />Also, Ibn Abbas said - about <b>Ar-Rahman</b> and <b>Ar-Rahim</b>, <br /> <br />`They are two soft names, one of them is softer than the other (meaning it carries more implications of mercy).' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said; As-Surri bin Yahya At-Tamimi narrated to me that Uthman bin Zufar related that Al-`Azrami said about <b>Ar-Rahman</b> and <b>Ar-Rahim</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;He is <b>Ar-Rahman</b> with all creation and <b>Ar-Rahim</b> with the believers.&#34; <br /> <br />Hence. Allah's statements, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ الرَّحْمَـنُ <br /> <br /> <br />Then He rose over <b>(Istawa)</b> the Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty), <b>Ar-Rahman</b>. (25&#59;59) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى <br /> <br /><b>Ar-Rahman</b> (Allah) rose over <b>(Istawa)</b> the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty. (20&#59;5) <br /> <br />Allah thus mentioned the <b>Istawa</b> - rising over the Throne - along with His Name <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, to indicate that His mercy encompasses all of His creation. <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً <br /> <br /> <br />And He is ever <b>Rahim</b> (merciful) to the believers, thus encompassing the believers with His Name <b>Ar-Rahim</b>. <br /> <br />They said, <br /> <br />&#34;This testifies to the fact that <b>Ar-Rahman</b> carries a broader scope of meanings pertaining to the mercy of Allah with His creation in both lives. Meanwhile, <b>Ar-Rahim</b> is exclusively for the believers.&#34; <br /> <br />Yet, we should mention that there is a supplication that reads, <br /> <br />رَحْمنَ الدُّنْيَا وَالاْخِرَةِ وَرَحِيمَهُمَا <br /> <br /> <br />The <b>Rahman</b> and the <b>Rahim</b> of this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah's Name <b>Ar-Rahman</b> is exclusively His. <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَأءَ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br /> <br />Say (O Muhammad)&#59;&#34;Invoke Allah or invoke <b>Ar-Rahman</b> (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names. (17&#59;110) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَاسْيلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَأ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you&#59;&#34;Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides <b>Ar-Rahman</b> (Most Gracious, Allah).&#34; (43&#59;45) <br /> <br />Further, when Musaylimah the Liar called himself the Rahman of Yamamah, Allah made him known by the name `Liar' and exposed him. Hence, whenever Musaylimah is mentioned, he is described as `the Liar'. He became an example for lying among the residents of the cities and villages and the residents of the deserts, the Bedouins. <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah first mentioned His Name - Allah - that is exclusively His and described this Name by <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, which no one else is allowed to use, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَأءَ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br /> <br />Say (O Muhammad)&#59;&#34;Invoke Allah or invoke <b>Ar-Rahman</b> (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names.&#34; (17&#59;110) <br /> <br />Only Musaylimah and those who followed his misguided ways described Musaylimah by Ar-Rahman. <br /> <br />As for Allah's Name <b>Ar-Rahim</b>, Allah has described others by it. <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />لَقَدْ جَأءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious over you (to be rightly guided) for the believers (he is) kind (full of pity), and <b>Rahim</b> (merciful). (9&#59;128) <br /> <br />Allah has also described some of His creation using some of His other Names. <br /> <br />For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الاِنسَـنَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَـهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, We have created man from <b>Nutfah</b> (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer (<b>Sami`</b>) and seer (<b>Basir</b>). (76&#59;2) <br /> <br />In conclusion, there are several of Allah's Names that are used as names for others besides Allah. Further, some of Allah's Names are exclusive for Allah alone, such as <b>Allah</b>, <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, <b>Al-Khaliq</b> (the Creator), <b>Ar-Raziq</b> (the Sustainer), and so forth. <br /> <br />Hence, Allah started the <b>Tasmiyah</b> (meaning, `In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious Most Merciful') with His Name, Allah, and described Himself as <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, (Most Gracious) which is softer and more general than <b>Ar-Rahim</b>. The most honorable Names are mentioned first, just as Allah did here. <br /> <br />A Hadith narrated by Umm Salamah stated that the recitation of the Messenger of Allah was slow and clear, letter by letter, <br /> <br />بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ <br /> <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ <br /> <br /> <br />مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ <br /> <br /> <br />In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. <br /> <br />The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <br /> <br />The Owner of the Day of Recompense. (1&#59;1-4) <br /> <br />And this is how a group of scholars recite it. Others connected the recitation of the <b>Tasmiyah</b> to Al-Hamd. <br /><b>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</b> <br /> <br />الْحَمْدُ للّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ <br /> (</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفاتحة<span class="num-ar">1</span> :<span class="num-ar">1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Fatihah<span> 1</span>:<span>1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Hamd</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Fatiha Verse 2" href="/en/1-al-fatiha/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=1,sura_dir="al-fatiha",count_ayat=7,number_aya=1;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
