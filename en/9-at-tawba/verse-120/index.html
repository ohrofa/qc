That is because they suffer no thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in Allâh´s way nor do they make a journey which enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain an advantage over an enemy, but a righteous deed is credited to their account (in the record of their deeds) because of it.

For if they had given priority to the life of the Messenger of God, they would not have experienced the hardships of thirst, fatigue, or hunger in their struggle for the cause of God, nor would their travelling have enraged the disbelievers and they would not have received any injury from enemies that God would not record for them as a virtuous deed. God does not ignore the reward of those who do good.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>The people of Madinah and the Arabs who dwell around them have no cause to stay behind the Messenger of Allah, or to prefer their lives to his. They are neither stricken by thirst, nor by tiredness, nor yet by hunger in the Way of Allah, nor do they take steps that anger the unbelievers, nor gain any gain from an enemy, but that it is counted as a righteous deed. Allah does not waste the wage of the gooddoers.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>It was neither befitting for the people of Al-Madinah and the bedouins of the neighborhood to remain behind Allah's Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither Zama' nor Nasab, nor Makhmasah in the cause of Allah, nor did they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy, but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>It was not proper for the people of Madinah and those desert Arabs around them to hold back from following God's Messenger, and to prefer their own lives to his life. This is because whenever they suffer from thirst or weariness or hunger for God's cause, and whenever they take any step which provokes those who deny the truth, or inflicts any loss upon the enemy, it shall be counted as a good deed in the sight of God, God will not deny the righteous their reward,</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and the Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind the Messenger of God, nor to prefer themselves to him. That is because they never suffer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the cause of God, nor do they take one step that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain anything from an enemy, but it is recorded to their credit as a righteous deed. God does not waste the reward of the righteous.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins [who dwell] around them to stay behind God's Messenger, when he sets out on a campaign, and to prefer their lives to his life, by guarding them against hardships which he [the Prophet] is content [to suffer] himself (this statement is a prohibition expressed as a predicate); that, prohibition against staying behind, is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicts them in the way of God, nor tread they any tread (mawti'an is a verbal noun, meaning wat'an) that enrages the disbelievers, nor gain any gain from the enemy, of God, be it through slaughter, capture or plunder, but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them, that they may be rewarded for it. Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waste, that is, the wage of those [mentioned], rather He rewards them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Rewards of Jihad</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />مَا كَانَ لاِاَهْلِ الْمَدِينَةِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُم مِّنَ الَاعْرَابِ أَن يَتَخَلَّفُواْ عَن رَّسُولِ اللّهِ وَلَا يَرْغَبُواْ بِأَنفُسِهِمْ عَن نَّفْسِهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ لَا يُصِيبُهُمْ ظَمَأٌ وَلَا نَصَبٌ وَلَا مَخْمَصَةٌ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />It was neither befitting for the people of Al-Madinah and the Bedouins of the neighborhood to remain behind Allah's Messenger nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither <b>Zama</b> nor <b>Nasab</b>, nor <b>Makhmasah</b> in the cause of Allah, <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, criticizes the people of Al-Madinah and the Bedouins around it, who did not participate in the battle of Tabuk with the Messenger of Allah. They sought to preserve themselves rather than comfort the Messenger during the hardship that he suffered in that battle. They incurred a loss in their share of the reward, since, <br /> <br />لَا يُصِيبُهُمْ ظَمَأٌ <br /> <br />they suffer neither <b>Zama</b>, (thirst), <br /> <br />وَلَا نَصَبٌ <br /> <br />nor <b>Nasab</b>, (fatigue), <br /> <br />وَلَا مَخْمَصَةٌ <br /> <br />nor <b>Makhmasah</b>, (hunger), <br /> <br />فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />in the cause of Allah, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَطَوُونَ مَوْطِيًا يَغِيظُ الْكُفَّارَ <br /> <br />nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers, <br /> <br />by strategies of war that would terrify their enemy, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَنَالُونَ <br /> <br />مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلً <br /> <br />nor inflict any injury upon an enemy, <br /> <br />a defeat on the enemy, <br />. <br />إِلاَّ كُتِبَ لَهُم <br /> <br />but is written to their credit, <br /> <br />as compensation for these steps that are not under their control, but a consequence of performing good deeds that earn them tremendous rewards, <br /> <br />بِهِ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ <br />as a deed of righteousness. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good. <br /> <br />Allah said in a similar <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلً <br /> <br />Certainly We shall not make the reward of anyone who does his (righteous) deeds in the most perfect manner to be lost.
