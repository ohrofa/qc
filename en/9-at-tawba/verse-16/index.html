Rather, they are sincere for Allah and His Messenger inwardly and outwardly. <br /> <br />Allah also said; <br /> <br />الم <br /> <br /> <br />أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا امَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ <br /> <br /><b>Alif-Lam-Mim</b>. <br /> <br />Do people think that they will be left alone because they say&#59;&#34;We believe,&#34; and will not be tested. <br /> <br />And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make known those who are true, and will certainly make known those who are liars... (29&#59;1-3) <br /> <br />أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ جَـهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ الصَّـبِرِينَ <br /> <br />Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allah tests those of you who fought (in His cause) and (also) tests those who are patient. (3&#59;142) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />مَّا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ عَلَى مَأ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَمِيزَ الْخَبِيثَ مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ <br /> <br />Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. (3&#59;179) <br />In summary, since Allah legislated <b>Jihad</b> for His servants, He explained that the wisdom behind doing so includes testing His servants, distinguishing between those who obey Him and those who disobey Him. <br /> <br /> وَاللّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah is well-acquainted with what you do. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted, is the All-Knower of what occurred, what will occur, and the true essence of what might occur had He decided it. Therefore, Allah knows everything before it occurs and how it will occur, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, nor a Lord except Him. Truly, there is none who can avert Allah's judgment and decision</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 15" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 17" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
