And Allah guides not the people who are rebellious. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Zuhrah bin Ma`bad said that his grandfather said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were with the Messenger of Allah, while he was holding the hand of Umar bin Al-Khattab. Umar said, `By Allah! You, O Messenger of Allah, are dearer to me than everything, except for myself.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا يُوْمِنُ أَحَدُكُمْ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ نَفْسِه <br /> <br />None among you will attain faith until I become dearer to him than even himself. <br /> <br />Umar said, `Verily, now, you are dearer to me than myself, by Allah!' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <b> <br />الاْنَ يَا عُمَر <br /></b> (Now, O `Umar)!&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud (this is the version of Abu Dawud) recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, <br /> <br />إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ بِالْعِينَةِ وَأَخَذْتُمْ بِأَذْنَابِ الْبَقَرِ وَرَضِيتُمْ بِالزَّرْعِ وَتَرَكْتُمُ الْجِهَادَ سَلَّطَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ ذُلاًّ لَا يَنْزِعُهُ حَتَّى تَرْجِعُوا إِلَى دِينِكُم <br /> <br />If you transact in <b>`Iynah</b> (a type of <b>Riba</b>), follow the tails of cows (tilling the land), become content with agriculture and abandoned <b>Jihad</b>, Allah will send on you disgrace that He will not remove until, you return to your religion.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 23" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 25" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=24;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
