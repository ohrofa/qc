Say&#59;&#34;Allah directs (thus) about Al-Kalalah.&#34; (4&#59;176), while the last <b>Surah</b> to be revealed was <b>Bara'ah</b>.&#34; <br />The Basmalah was not mentioned in the beginning of this <b>Surah</b> because the Companions did not write it in the complete copy of the Qur'an (<b>Mushaf</b>) they collected, following the Commander of the faithful, Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him. <br /> <br />The first part of this honorable <b>Surah</b> was revealed to the Messenger of Allah when he returned from the battle of Tabuk, during the <b>Hajj</b> season, which the Prophet thought about attending. But he remembered that the idolators would still attend that <b>Hajj</b>, as was usual in past years, and that they perform <b>Tawaf</b> around the House while naked. He disliked to associate with them and sent Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, to lead <b>Hajj</b> that year and show the people their rituals, commanding him to inform the idolators that they would not be allowed to participate in <b>Hajj</b> after that season. He commanded him to proclaim, <br />بَرَاءةٌ مِّنَ اللّهِ وَرَسُولِه <br /> (Freedom from (all) obligations (is declared) from Allah and His Messenger...), to the people. <br /> <br />When Abu Bakr had left, the Messenger sent Ali bin Abu Talib to be the one to deliver this news to the idolators on behalf of the Messenger, for he was the Messenger's cousin. We will mention this story later. <br /><b>Publicizing the Disavowal of the Idolators</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />بَرَاءةٌ مِّنَ اللّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ <br /> <br /> <br />Freedom from obligations from Allah and His Messenger, <br /> <br />is a declaration of freedom from all obligations from Allah and His Messenger, <br /> <br />إِلَى الَّذِينَ عَاهَدتُّم مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 2" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
