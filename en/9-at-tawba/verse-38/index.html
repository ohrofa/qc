What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, <br /> <br />if you are called to perform <b>Jihad</b> in the cause of Allah, <br /> <br />اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الَارْضِ <br /> <br />you cling heavily to the earth, <br /> <br />reclining to remain in peace, shade and ripe fruits. <br /> <br />أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الاخِرَةِ <br /> <br />Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter, <br /> <br />why do you do this, is it because you prefer this life instead of the Hereafter Allah. <br /> <br />next diminishes the eagerness for this worldly life and increases it for the Hereafter, <br /> <br />فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الاخِرَةِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world compared to the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Mustawrid, a member of Bani Fihr, said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَا الدُّنْيَا فِي الاْاخِرَةِ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَجْعَلُ أَحَدُكُمْ إِصْبَعَهُ هَذِهِ فِي الْيَمِّ فَلْيَنْظُرْ بِمَ تَرْجِعُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is just like when one of you dips his finger in the sea, let him contemplate how much of it his finger would carry? <br /> <br />The Prophet pointed with his index finger. Muslim collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri narrated that Al-A`mash said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الاخِرَةِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ <br /></b> (But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world compared to the Hereafter). <br /> <br />&#34;What compares to the provision a traveler takes.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdul-Aziz bin Abi Hazim narrated that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;When Abdul-Aziz bin Marwan was dying he said, `Bring the shroud I will be covered with so that I inspect it.' <br /> <br />When it was placed before him, he looked at it and said, `Is this what I will end up with from this life!' <br /> <br />He then turned his back and cried, while saying, `Woe to you, O life! Your abundance is truly little, your little is short lived, we were deceived by you.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah warns those who do not join <b>Jihad</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 37" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-37/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">38</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>38</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 39" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-39/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
