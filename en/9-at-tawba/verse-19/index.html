Allah mentioned their arrogance and rejection (of the faith), saying to `the people of <b>Al-Haram</b>', who were idolators, <br /> <br />قَدْ كَانَتْ ءَايَـتِى تُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ <br /> <br />مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَـمِراً تَهْجُرُونَ <br /> <br />Indeed My <b>Ayat</b> used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels (denying them, and refusing to listen to them with hatred). In pride, talking evil about it (the Qur'an) by night. (23&#59;66-67) <br /> <br />They used to boast about being those who maintained the Sacred Sanctuary, <br />بِهِ سَـمِراً <br /> (talking about it by night). <br /> <br />They used to talk about this by night while shunning the Qur'an and the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah declared that faith and <b>Jihad</b> with the Prophet are better than the idolators' maintaining <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> and providing water for pilgrims. These actions -- maintaining and serving Allah's House -- will not benefit them with Allah because they associate others with Him. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />لَا يَسْتَوُونَ عِندَ اللّهِ وَاللّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are not equal before Allah. And Allah guides not those people who are the wrongdoers. <br /> <br />those who claimed they are the maintainers of the House. Allah described them with injustice, on account of their <b>Shirk</b>, and thus, their maintaining the <b>Masjid</b> will not avail them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about Al-Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib, for when he was captured in the battle of <b>Badr</b>, he said, `If you rushed before us to embrace Islam, perform <b>Hijrah</b> and <b>Jihad</b>, we were maintaining <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, providing water for the pilgrims and setting the indebted free.' <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, said, <br /> <br />أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ الْحَاجِّ وَعِمَارَةَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ كَمَنْ امَنَ بِاللّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ وَجَاهَدَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />لَا يَسْتَوُونَ عِندَ اللّهِ وَاللّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> as equal to the worth of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah! They are not equal before Allah. And Allah guides not those people who are the wrongdoers. <br /> <br />Allah says, `All these actions were performed while committing <b>Shirk</b>, and I do not accept the (good deeds) that are performed while in a state of <b>Shirk</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, <br /> <br />&#34;Muslims came to Al-Abbas and his friends who were captured during the battle of <b>Badr</b> and admonished them for their <b>Shirk</b>. Al-Abbas said, `By Allah! We used to maintain <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, release the indebted, serve the House (or cover it, or maintain it) and provide water for pilgrims.' Allah revealed this verse, <br />أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ الْحَاجِّ <br /> (Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims...&#34;' <br /> <br />There is a <b>Hadith</b> (from the Prophet) about the <b>Tafsir</b> of this <b>Ayah</b> that we should mention. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir said that; <br /> <br />a man said, &#34;I do not care if I do not perform an action after embracing Islam other than providing drinking water for pilgrims (who visit the <b>Ka`bah</b> at Makkah).&#34; <br /> <br />Another man said, &#34;I do not care if I do not perform an action after embracing Islam other than maintaining <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />A third man said, &#34;<b>Jihad</b> in the cause of Allah is more righteous than what you have said.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar admonished them, &#34;Do not raise your voices next to the <b>Minbar</b> of the Messenger of Allah,&#34; <br /> <br />and as it was a Friday, he said, &#34;but after we pray the Friday prayer, we will go to the Prophet and ask him.&#34; <br /> <br />This verse was revealed, <br />أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ الْحَاجِّ وَعِمَارَةَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br />(Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>), until, <br />لَا يَسْتَوُونَ عِندَ اللّهِ <br /> (They are not equal before Allah). <br /> <br />Then Allah said; <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً عِندَ اللّهِ وَأُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الْفَايِزُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 18" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 20" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
