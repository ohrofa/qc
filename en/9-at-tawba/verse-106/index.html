These [others mentioned] are the three, who will be mentioned afterwards&#59; Murra b. al-Rab`, Ka`b b. Mlik and Hill b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet, not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others, however, they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet (s), and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days, during which time people avoided them, until it was later revealed that God had relented to them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Delaying the Decision about the Three Companions Who stayed away from the Battle of Tabuk</b> <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَاخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لاِاَمْرِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />And others are made to await for Allah's Decree, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and several others said that; <br /> <br />those mentioned in the <b>Ayah</b> are the three who were made to wait to know if their repentance was accepted; <br /> <br />Mararah bin Ar-Rabi, <br /> <br />Ka`b bin Malik and <br /> <br />Hilal bin Umayyah. <br /> <br />Some Companions stayed behind from the battle of Tabuk due to laziness, preferring comfort, ease, ripe fruits and shade. They did not lag behind because of hypocrisy or doubts. <br /> <br />Some of them tied themselves to the pillars (of the <b>Masjid</b>) like Abu Lubabah and several of his friends did. Some of them did not do that, and they are the three mentioned here. Those who tied themselves received their pardon before these three men whose pardon was delayed, until this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />لَقَد تَّابَ الله عَلَى النَّبِيِّ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالَانصَارِ <br /> <br />Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin and the Ansar... (9&#59;117) <br /> <br />وَعَلَى الثَّلَثَةِ الَّذِينَ خُلِّفُواْ حَتَّى إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الَارْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ <br /> <br />And the three who stayed behind, until for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened... (9&#59;118) <br /> <br />We will mention the <b>Hadith</b> about this story from Ka`b bin Malik. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِمَّا يُعَذِّبُهُمْ وَإِمَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />whether He will punish them or will forgive them. <br /> <br />meaning, they are at Allah's mercy, if He wills, He pardons them or punishes them. However, Allah's mercy comes before His anger, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <br /> <br />Allah knows those who deserve the punishment and those who deserve the pardon. He is All-Wise in His actions and statements, there is no deity worthy of worship nor Lord besides Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 105" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-105/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">106</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>106</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 107" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-107/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=106;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
