They then refrained from invoking Allah to forgive the dead among them, but were not stopped from invoking Allah for the living among them until they die.

He will say, `O Ibrahim! I disobeyed you, but today, I will not disobey you.' <br /> <br />Ibrahim will say, `O Lord! You promised me that You will not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected. What more disgrace than witnessing my father being disgraced!' <br /> <br />He will be told, `Look behind you,' where he will see a bloody hyena -- for his father will have been transformed into that -- and it will be dragged from its feet and thrown in the Fire.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لاوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Ibrahim was <b>Awwah</b> and was forbearing. <br /> <br />According to Abdullah bin Mas`ud, <br /> <br />means, he invoked Allah always, <br /> <br />Several narrations report this from Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />It was also said that, <b>`Awwah</b>', means, <br /> <br />`who invokes Allah with humility', `merciful', `who believes with certainty', `who praises (Allah)', and so forth</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 113" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">114</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>114</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 115" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-115/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=114;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
