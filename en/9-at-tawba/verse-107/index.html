They had asked the Prophet (s) to perform prayers in it, and so the following was revealed&#59;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Masjid Ad-Dirar and Masjid At-Taqwa</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُواْ مَسْجِدًا ضِرَارًا وَكُفْرًا وَتَفْرِيقًا بَيْنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ وَإِرْصَادًا لِّمَنْ حَارَبَ اللّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />And as for those who put up a <b>Masjid</b> by way of harm and disbelief and to disunite the believers and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime, <br /> <br />The reason behind revealing these honorable <b>Ayat</b> is that; <br /> <br />before the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, there was a man from Al-Khazraj called &#34;Abu Amir Ar-Rahib (the Monk).&#34; This man embraced Christianity before Islam and read the Scriptures. During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, Abu Amir was known for being a worshipper and being a notable person among Al-Khazraj. <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah arrived at Al-Madinah after the <b>Hijrah</b>, the Muslims gathered around him and the word of Islam was triumphant on the day of <b>Badr</b>, causing Abu Amir, the cursed one, to choke on his own saliva and announce his enmity to Islam. <br /> <br />He fled from Al-Madinah to the idolators of Quraysh in Makkah to support them in the war against the Messenger of Allah. The Quraysh united their forces and the Bedouins who joined them for the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, during which Allah tested the Muslims, but the good end is always for the pious and righteous people. <br /> <br />The rebellious Abu Amir dug many holes in the ground between the two camps, into one of which the Messenger fell, injuring his face and breaking one of his right lower teeth. He also sustained a head injury. <br /> <br />Before the fighting started, Abu Amir approached his people among the Ansar and tried to convince them to support and agree with him. When they recognized him, they said, &#34;May Allah never burden an eye by seeing you, O <b>Fasiq</b> one, O enemy of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />They cursed him and he went back declaring, &#34;By Allah! Evil has touched my people after I left.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah called Abu Amir to Allah and recited the Qur'an to him before his flight to Makkah, but he refused to embrace Islam and rebelled. The Messenger invoked Allah that Abu Amir die as an outcast in an alien land, and his invocation came true. <br /> <br />After the battle of <b>Uhud</b> was finished, Abu Amir realized that the Messenger's call was still rising and gaining momentum, so he went to Heraclius, the emperor of Rome, asking for his aid against the Prophet. Heraclius gave him promises and Abu Amir remained with him. <br /> <br />He also wrote to several of his people in Al-Madinah, who embraced hypocrisy, promising and insinuating to them that he will lead an army to fight the Messenger of Allah to defeat him and his call. He ordered them to establish a stronghold where he could send his emissaries and to serve as an outpost when he joins them later on. <br /> <br />These hypocrites built a <b>Masjid</b> next to the <b>Masjid</b> in Quba', and they finished building it before the Messenger went to Tabuk. They went to the Messenger inviting him to pray in their <b>Masjid</b> so that it would be a proof that the Messenger approved of their <b>Masjid</b>. <br /> <br />They told him that they built the <b>Masjid</b> for the weak and ill persons on rainy nights. However, Allah prevented His Messenger from praying in that <b>Masjid</b>. He said to them, <br /> <br />إِنَّا عَلَى سَفَرٍ وَلَكِنْ إِذَا رَجَعْنَا إِنْ شَاءَ الله <br /> <br />&#34;If we come back from our travel, Allah willing.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah came back from Tabuk and was approximately one or two days away from Al-Madinah, Jibril came down to him with the news about <b>Masjid</b> Ad-Dirar and the disbelief and division between the believers, who were in <b>Masjid</b> Quba' (which was built on piety from the first day), that <b>Masjid</b> Ad-Dirar was meant to achieve. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah sent some people to <b>Masjid</b> Ad-Dirar to bring it down before he reached Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said about this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;They are some people of the Ansar to whom Abu Amir said, `Build a <b>Masjid</b> and prepare whatever you can of power and weapons, for I am headed towards Caesar, emperor of Rome, to bring Roman soldiers with whom I will expel Muhammad and his companions.' <br /> <br />When they built their <b>Masjid</b>, they went to the Prophet and said to him, &#34;We finished building our <b>Masjid</b> and we would like you pray in it and invoke Allah for us for His blessings.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah revealed this verse, <br />لَا تَقُمْ فِيهِ أَبَدًا <br /> (Never stand you therein), (9&#59;108) until, <br />الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> (...wrongdoers) (9&#59;109).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَلَيَحْلِفَنَّ <br /> <br />they will indeed swear, <br /> <br />those who built it, <br /> <br />إِنْ أَرَدْنَا إِلاَّ الْحُسْنَى <br /> <br />that their intention is nothing but good. <br /> <br />by building this <b>Masjid</b> we sought the good and the comfort of the people. <br /> <br />Allah replied, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars. <br /> <br />for they only built it to harm <b>Masjid</b> Quba', and out of disbelief in Allah, and to divide the believers. They made it an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His Messenger, such as Abu Amir the <b>Fasiq</b> who used to be called Ar-Rahib, may Allah curse him! <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 106" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-106/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">107</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>107</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 108" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-108/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=107;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
