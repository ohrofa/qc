Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon him, His reassurance -- some say this means upon the Prophet, others, that it means upon Ab Bakr -- and supported him, that is, the Prophet (s), with legions, of angels, you did not see, [both] in the cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved, that is, the call to idolatry, the nethermost, the one vanquished, and the Word of God, that is, the profession of His Oneness (shahda), was the uppermost, the one prevailing and triumphant.

They remained in the cave for three days so that the pagans who were sent in their pursuit, returned (to Makkah), and they proceed to Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />إِذْ هُمَا فِي الْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا <br /> <br />when they were both in the cave, he said to his companion&#59;&#34;Be not sad (or afraid), surely, Allah is with us.&#34; <br /> <br />While in the cave, Abu Bakr was afraid the pagans might discover them for fear that some harm might touch the Messenger. <br /> <br />The Prophet kept reassuring him and strengthening his resolve, saying, <br /> <br />يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ مَا ظَنُكَ بِاثْنَينِ اللهُ ثَالِثُهُمَا <br /> <br />O Abu Bakr!
