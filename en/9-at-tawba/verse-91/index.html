He first mentions the excuses that remain with a person, the weakness in the body that disallows one from <b>Jihad</b>, such as blindness, limping, and so forth. He then mentions the excuses that are not permanent, such as an illness that would prevent one from fighting in the cause of Allah, or poverty that prevents preparing for <b>Jihad</b>. There is no sin in these cases if they remain behind, providing that when they remain behind, they do not spread malice or try to discourage Muslims from fighting, but all the while observing good behavior in this state, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />مَا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ وَاللّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />Al-Awza`i said, <br /> <br />&#34;The people went out for the <b>Istisqa'</b> (rain) prayer. Bilal bin Sa`d stood up, praised Allah and thanked Him then said, `O those who are present! Do you concur that wrong has been done!' <br /> <br />They said, `Yes, by Allah!' <br /> <br />He said, `O Allah! We hear your statement, <br />مَا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ <br /> (No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good). O Allah! We admit our errors, so forgive us and give us mercy and rain.' <br /> <br />He then raised his hands and the people also raised their hands, and rain was sent down on them.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 90" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 92" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=91;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
