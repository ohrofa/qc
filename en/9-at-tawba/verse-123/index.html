Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you; and know that Allah is with those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. <br /> <br />Allah commands the believers to fight the disbelievers, the closest in area to the Islamic state, then the farthest. <br /> <br />This is why the Messenger of Allah started fighting the idolators in the Arabian Peninsula. When he finished with them and Allah gave him control over Makkah, Al-Madinah, At-Ta'if, Yemen, Yamamah, Hajr, Khyber, Hadramawt and other Arab provinces, and the various Arab tribes entered Islam in large crowds, he then started fighting the People of the Scriptures. <br /> <br />He began preparations to fight the Romans who were the closest in area to the Arabian Peninsula, and as such, had the most right to be called to Islam, especially since they were from the People of the Scriptures. The Prophet marched until he reached Tabuk and went back because of the extreme hardship, little rain and little supplies. <br /> <br />This battle occurred on the ninth year after his <b>Hijrah</b>. In the tenth year, the Messenger of Allah was busy with the Farewell <b>Hajj</b>. The Messenger died eighty-one days after he returned from that <b>Hajj</b>, Allah chose him for what He had prepared for him (in Paradise). <br /> <br />After his death, his executor, friend, and <b>Khalifah</b>, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, became the leader. At that time, the religion came under attack and would have been defeated, if it had not been for the fact that Allah gave the religion firmness through Abu Bakr, who established its basis and made its foundations firm. He brought those who strayed from the religion back to it, and made those who reverted from Islam return. He took the <b>Zakah</b> from the evil people who did not want to pay it, and explained the truth to those who were unaware of it. On behalf of the Prophet, Abu Bakr delivered what he was entrusted with. <br /> <br />Then, he started preparing the Islamic armies to fight the Roman cross worshippers, and the Persian fire worshippers. By the blessing of his mission, Allah opened the lands for him and brought down Caesar and Kisra and those who obeyed them among the servants. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr spent their treasures in the cause of Allah, just as the Messenger of Allah had foretold would happen. This mission continued after Abu Bakr at the hands of he whom Abu Bakr chose to be his successor, Al-Farooq, the Martyr of the Mihrab, Abu Hafs, Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him. With Umar, Allah humiliated the disbelievers, suppressed the tyrants and hypocrites, and opened the eastern and western parts of the world. <br /> <br />The treasures of various countries were brought to Umar from near and far provinces, and he divided them according to the legitimate and accepted method. Umar then died as a martyr after he lived a praise worthy life. Then, the Companions among the <b>Muhajirin</b> and <b>Ansar</b> agreed to chose after Umar, Uthman bin Affan, Leader of the faithful and Martyr of the House, may Allah be pleased with him. <br /> <br />During Uthman's reign, Islam wore its widest garment and Allah's unequivocal proof was established in various parts of the world over the necks of the servants. Islam appeared in the eastern and western parts of the world and Allah's Word was elevated and His religion apparent. The pure religion reached its deepest aims against Allah's enemies, and whenever Muslims overcame an <b>Ummah</b>, they moved to the next one, and then the next one, crushing the tyrannical evil doers. They did this in reverence to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُم مِّنَ الْكُفَّارِ <br /> <br /> <br />O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً <br /> <br />and let them find harshness in you, <br /> <br />meaning, let the disbelievers find harshness in you against them in battle. The complete believer is he who is kind to his believing brother, and harsh with his disbelieving enemy. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ <br /> <br />Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers... (5&#59;54) <br /> <br />مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَأءُ بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. (48&#59;29) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />يَأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ جَـهِدِ الْكُفَّـرَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />O Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh against them. (9&#59;73) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br />. <br />وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And know that Allah is with those who have <b>Taqwa</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, fight the disbelievers and trust in Allah knowing that Allah is with you if you fear and obey Him. <br /> <br />This was the case in the first three blessed generations of Islam, the best members of this <b>Ummah</b>. Since they were firm on the religion and reached an unsurpassed level of obedience to Allah, they consistently prevailed over their enemies. During that era, victories were abundant, and enemies were ever more in a state of utter loss and degradation. <br /> <br />However, after the turmoil began, desires and divisions became prevalent between various Muslim kings, the enemies were eager to attack the outposts of Islam and marched into its territory without much opposition. Then, the Muslim kings were too busy with their enmity for each other. The disbelievers then marched to the capital cities of the Islamic states, after gaining control over many of its areas, in addition to entire Islamic lands. <br /> <br />Verily, ownership of all affairs is with Allah in the beginning and in the end. Whenever a just Muslim king stood up and obeyed Allah's orders, all the while trusting in Allah, Allah helped him regain control over some Muslim lands and took back from the enemy what was compatible to his obedience and support to Allah. <br /> <br />We ask Allah to help the Muslims gain control over the forelocks of His disbeliever enemies and to raise high the word of Muslims over all lands. Verily, Allah is Most Generous, Most Giving</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 122" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">123</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>123</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 124" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-124/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=123;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
