This might have caused corruption and great evil between the believers. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Those who sought permission (from the Messenger to lag behind) included some of the chiefs, such as Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul and Al-Jadd bin Qays, who were masters of their people. Allah also made them lag behind because He knew that if they went along with the Messenger they would sow sedition in his army.&#34; <br /> <br />There were some in the Prophet's army who liked these chiefs and were ready to obey them, because they considered them honorable, <br />وَفِيكُمْ سَمَّاعُونَ لَهُمْ <br /> (and there are some among you who would have listened to them). <br /> <br />Allah next reminds of His perfect knowledge, saying, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is the All-Knower of the wrongdoers. <br /> <br />Allah says that He knows what occurred, what will occur and if anything would have occurred, how it would occur, such as, <b> <br />لَوْ خَرَجُواْ فِيكُم مَّا زَادُوكُمْ إِلاَّ خَبَالاً <br /></b> (Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder), indicating what they would have done had they marched, even though they did not. <br /> <br />Allah said in similar <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ <br /> <br />But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars. (6&#59;28) <br /> <br />وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لَاسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ <br /> <br />Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth). (8&#59;23) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ اقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ أَوِ اخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً <br /> <br />وَإِذاً لاّتَيْنَـهُمْ مِّن لَّدُنَّـا أَجْراً عَظِيماً <br /> <br />وَلَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ صِرَطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً <br /> <br />And if We had ordered them (saying), &#34;Kill yourselves (the innocent ones kill the guilty ones) or leave your homes,&#34; very few of them would have done it; but if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and would have strengthened their conviction. <br /> <br />And indeed We would then have bestowed upon them a great reward from Ourselves. <br /> <br />And indeed We would have guided them to the straight way.
