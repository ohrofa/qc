Verily, the Mushrikin are impure. So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Haram after this year; <br /> <br />Allah commands His believing servants, who are pure in religion and person, to expel the idolators who are filthy in the religious sense, from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>. <br /> <br />After the revelation of this <b>Ayah</b>, idolators were no longer allowed to go near the <b>Masjid</b>. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> was revealed in the ninth year of <b>Hijrah</b>. The Messenger of Allah sent Ali in the company of Abu Bakr that year to publicize to the idolators that no <b>Mushrik</b> will be allowed to perform <b>Hajj</b> after that year, nor a naked person allowed to perform Tawaf around the House. <br /> <br />Allah completed this decree, made it a legislative ruling, as well as, a fact of reality. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ فَلَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا <br /></b> (O you who believe! Verily, the Mushrikin are impure. So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Haram after this year), <br /> <br />&#34;Unless it was a servant or one of the people of <b>Dhimmah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Abu Amr Al-Awza'i said, <br /> <br />&#34;Umar bin Abdul-Aziz wrote (to his governors) to prevent Jews and Christians from entering the <b>Masjids</b> of Muslims, and he followed his order with Allah's statement, <br />إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ <br /> (Verily, the <b>Mushrikin</b> are impure). <br /> <br />Ata said, <br /> <br />&#34;All of the Sacred Area (the <b>Haram</b>) is considered a <b>Masjid</b>, for Allah said, <br />فَلَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا <br /> (So let them not come near Al-<b>Masjid Al-Haram</b> (at Makkah) after this year).&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that idolators are impure and that the believers are pure. In the <b>Sahih</b> is the following, <br /> <br />الْمُوْمِنُ لَا يَنْجُس <br /> <br />The believer does not become impure. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ اللّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> <br />and if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you, out of His bounty. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq commented, <br /> <br />&#34;The people said, `Our markets will be closed, our commerce disrupted, and what we earned will vanish.' <br /> <br />So Allah revealed this verse, <br />وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ اللّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> (and if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you, out of His bounty), from other resources, <br />إِن شَاء <br /> (if He wills), until, <br />وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ <br /> (... and feel themselves subdued). <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, `this will be your compensation for the closed markets that you feared would result.' <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah compensated them for the losses they incurred because they severed ties with idolators, by the <b>Jizyah</b> they earned from the People of the Book.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar statements were reported from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak and others. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, (in what benefits you), <br /> <br />حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Wise, <br /> <br />in His orders and prohibitions, for He is All-Perfect in His actions and statements, All-Just in His creations and decisions, Blessed and Hallowed be He. This is why Allah compensated Muslims for their losses by the amount of <b>Jizyah</b> that they took from the people of <b>Dhimmah</b>. <br /><b>The Order to fight People of the Scriptures until They give the Jizyah</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 27" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">28</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>28</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 29" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
