He also states that the disbelief and hypocrisy of the Bedouins is worse and deeper than the disbelief and hypocrisy of others. They are the most likely of being ignorant of the commandments that Allah has revealed to His Messenger. <br /> <br />Al-A`mash narrated that Ibrahim said, <br /> <br />&#34;A Bedouin man sat next to Zayd bin Sawhan while he was speaking to his friends. Zayd had lost his hand during the battle of Nahawand. The Bedouin man said, `By Allah! I like your speech. However, your hand causes me suspicion.' <br /> <br />Zayd said, `Why are you suspicious because of my hand, it is the left hand (that is cut).' <br /> <br />The Bedouin man said, `By Allah! I do not know which hand they cut off (for committing theft), is it the right or the left?' <br /> <br />Zayd bin Sawhan said, `Allah has said the truth, <br /> <br />الَاعْرَابُ أَشَدُّ كُفْرًا وَنِفَاقًا وَأَجْدَرُ أَلاَّ يَعْلَمُواْ حُدُودَ مَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ <br /> <br /> <br />The Bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to not know the limits which Allah has revealed to His Messenger.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad narrated that Ibn Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ سَكَنَ الْبَادِيَةَ جَفَا <br /> <br />وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ الصَّيْدَ غَفَلَ <br /> <br />وَمَنْ أَتَى السُّلْطَانَ افْتُتِن <br /> <br />He who lives in the desert becomes hard-hearted, <br /> <br />he who follows the game becomes heedless, and <br /> <br />he who associates with the rulers falls into <b>Fitnah</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet once had to give a Bedouin man many gifts because of what he gave him as a gift, until the Bedouin became satisfied. The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ أَنْ لَا أَقْبَلَ هَدِيَّةً إِلاَّ مِنْ قُرَشِيَ أَوْ ثَقَفِيَ أَوْ أَنْصَارِيَ أَوْ دَوْسِي <br /> <br />I almost decided not to accept a gift except from someone from Quraysh, Thaqafi, the Ansar or Daws. <br /> <br />This is because these people lived in cities, Makkah, At-Ta'if, Al-Madinah and Yemen, and therefore, their conduct and manners are nicer than that of the hard-hearted Bedouins. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise. <br /> <br />Allah knows those who deserve to be taught faith and knowledge, He wisely distributes knowledge or ignorance, faith or disbelief and hypocrisy between His servants. He is never questioned as to what He does, for He is the All-Knower, All-Wise. <br /> <br />Allah also said that</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 96" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-96/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">97</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>97</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 98" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-98/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
