They asked the Messenger for permission to stay behind, saying, <br /> <br /> ذَرْنَا نَكُن <br />مَّعَ الْقَاعِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home).&#34; <br /> <br />thus accepting for themselves the shame of lagging behind with women, after the army had left. If war starts, such people are the most cowardice, but when it is safe, they are the most boastful among men. <br /> <br />Allah described them in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا جَأءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِى يُغْشَى عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ <br /> <br />Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues. (33&#59;19) <br /> <br />their tongues direct their harsh words against you, when it is safe to do so. In battle, however, they are the most cowardice among men. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَإِذَا أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا الْقِتَالُ رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ نَظَرَ الْمَغْشِىِّ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فَأَوْلَى لَهُمْ <br /> <br />طَاعَةٌ وَقَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ فَإِذَا عَزَمَ الاٌّمْرُ فَلَوْ صَدَقُواْ اللَّهَ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ <br /> <br />Those who believe say&#59;&#34;Why is not a <b>Surah</b> sent down (for us)! But when a decisive <b>Surah</b> (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, and fighting is mentioned therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them. Obedience (to Allah) and good words (were better for them). And when the matter is resolved on, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them.
