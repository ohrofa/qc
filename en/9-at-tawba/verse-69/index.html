They had enjoyed their portion (a while), so enjoy your portion (a while) as those before you enjoyed, <br /> <br />Allah says, these people were touched by torment in this life and the Hereafter, just as those before them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br /> <br />بِخَلَقِهِمْ <br /> <br />their portion, <br /> <br />According to Al-Hasan Al-Basri, <br /> <br />means, (they mocked) their religion. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَخُضْتُمْ كَالَّذِي خَاضُواْ <br /> <br />and you indulged in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime, <br /> <br />indulged in lies and falsehood, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ <br /> <br />Such are they whose deeds are in vain, <br /> <br />their deeds are annulled; they will not acquire any rewards for them because they are invalid, <br /> <br />فِي الُّدنْيَا وَالاخِرَةِ وَأُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers. <br /> <br />because they will not acquire any rewards for their actions. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;How similar is this night to the last night, <br />كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ <br /> (Like those before you...). These are the Children of Israel, with whom we were compared. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّهُمْ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْهُمْ جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه <br /> <br />By He in Whose Hand is my life! You will imitate them, and even if a man of them entered the den of a lizard, you will enter it likewise!&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّ سَنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ شِبْرًا بِشِبْرٍ وَذِرَاعًا بِذِرَاعٍ وَبَاعًا بِبَاعٍ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلُوا جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه <br /> <br />By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will follow the traditions of those who were before you a hand span for a hand-span and forearm's length for forearm's length, and an arm's length for an arm's length. And even if they enter the den of a lizard, you will also enter it. <br /> <br />They asked, &#34;Who, O Allah's Messenger, the People of the Book?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, Who else.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is similar to another <b>Hadith</b> collected in the <b>Sahih</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 68" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-68/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">69</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>69</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 70" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=69;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
