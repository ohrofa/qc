A mosque which was founded, one whose foundations were built, upon piety from the first day, constructed the day you arrived in Medina (dr al-hijra) -- this was the mosque of Qub', as mentioned in Bukhr -- is worthier, than that [other one], for you to stand, to perform prayer, therein; in it are men, namely, the Ansr, who love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves (muttahhirn&#59; the original t' [of mutatahhirn] has been assimilated with the t') that is, He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma reported in his Sahh [by way of an isnd] from [`Uwaym] b. S`ida that&#59; `The Prophet (s) came to them at the mosque of Qub' and said, &#34;God, exalted be He, has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves in the story about your mosque, so what is this purification which you perform?&#34; They said, &#34;By God, O Messenger of God, all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash their behinds after defecation, and so we began to wash in the way they did&#34;'. According to one hadth reported by al-Bazzr [they said]&#59; `We use stones [to scrape off remnants] and follow this with water'; to which he [the Prophet] said, `That is the way [for proper purification]. Let this be your way'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>لَا تَقُمْ فِيهِ أَبَدًا <br /> <br />Never stand you therein, <br /> <br />prohibiting His Prophet and his <b>Ummah</b> from ever standing in it in prayer. <br /><b>Virtues of Masjid Quba</b> <br /> <br />Allah encouraged His Prophet to pray in <b>Masjid</b> Quba' which, from the first day, was built on <b>Taqwa</b>, obedience to Allah and His Messenger, for gathering the word of the believers and as an outpost and a fort for Islam and its people. This is why Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />لَّمَسْجِدٌ أُسِّسَ عَلَى التَّقْوَى مِنْ أَوَّلِ يَوْمٍ أَحَقُّ أَن تَقُومَ فِيهِ <br /> <br />Verily, the <b>Masjid</b> whose foundation was laid from the first day on <b>Taqwa</b> is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). <br /> <br />in reference to the <b>Masjid</b> of Quba'. <br /> <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> records that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />صَلَةٌ فِي مَسْجِدِ قُبَاءٍ كَعُمْرَة <br /> <br />One prayer in <b>Masjid</b> Quba' is just like an <b>Umrah</b>. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah used to visit <b>Masjid</b> Quba' while riding and walking. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Uwaym bin Sa`idah Al-Ansari said that; <br /> <br />the Prophet went to Masjid Quba' and asked, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى قَدْ أَحْسَنَ عَلَيْكُمُ الثَّنَاءَ فِي الطُّهُورِ فِي قِصَّةِ مَسْجِدِكُمْ فَمَا هَذَا الطُّهُورُ الَّذِي تَطَهَّرُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br /> <br />In the story about your <b>Masjid</b>, Allah the Exalted has praised you concerning the purification that you perform. What is the purification that you perform! <br /> <br />They said, &#34;By Allah, O Allah's Messenger! We do not know except that we had neighbors from the Jews who used to use water to wash with after answering the call of nature, and we washed as they washed.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Khuzaymah collected this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لَّمَسْجِدٌ أُسِّسَ عَلَى التَّقْوَى مِنْ أَوَّلِ يَوْمٍ أَحَقُّ أَن تَقُومَ فِيهِ فِيهِ رِجَالٌ يُحِبُّونَ أَن يَتَطَهَّرُواْ وَاللّهُ يُحِبُّ الْمُطَّهِّرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, the <b>Masjid</b> whose foundation was laid from the first day on <b>Taqwa</b> is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). In it are men who love to clean and purify themselves. And Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure. <br /> <br />This encourages praying in old <b>Masjids</b> that were built for the purpose of worshipping Allah alone, without partners. <br /> <br />It is also recommended to join the prayer with the believing group and worshippers who implement their faith, those who perform <b>Wudu</b> perfectly and preserve themselves from impure things. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that; <br /> <br />one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said that the Messenger of Allah led them in a Dawn (<b>Subh</b>) prayer in which he recited <b>Ar-Rum</b> (Surah 30) and made mistakes in the recitation. When he finished the prayer, he said, <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ يَلْبِسُ عَلَيْنَا الْقُرْانَ أَنَّ أَقْوَامًا مِنْكُمْ يُصَلُّونَ مَعَنَا لَا يُحْسِنُونَ الْوُضُوءَ فَمَنْ شَهِدَ الصَّلَةَ مَعَنَا فَلْيُحْسِنِ الْوُضُوء <br /> <br />We sometimes make mistakes in reciting the Qur'an, there are people among you who attend the prayer with us, but do not perform <b>Wudu</b> perfectly. Therefore, whoever attends the prayer with us let him make perfect <b>Wudu</b>. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> indicates that complete purification helps in the performance of acts of worship and aids in preserving and completing them</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 107" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-107/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">108</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>108</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 109" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-109/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
