They have knowledge about what should be performed and what should be shunned. <br /> <br />This includes abiding by Allah's limits in knowledge and action, meaning, what He allowed and what He prohibited. Therefore, they worship the True Lord and advise creation. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَبَشِّرِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And give glad tidings to the believers. <br /> <br />since faith includes all of this, and the supreme success is for those who have faith</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 111" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 113" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
