Say, `<b>La ilaha illa-llah</b>,' a word concerning which I will plea for you with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />Abu Jahl and Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah said, `O Abu Talib! Would you leave the religion of Abdul-Muttalib!' <br /> <br />Abu Talib said, `Rather, I will remain on the religion of Abdul-Muttalib.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاأَسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ مَا لَمْ أُنْهَ عَنْك <br /> <br />I will invoke Allah for forgiveness for you, as long as I am not prohibited from doing so. <br /> <br />This verse was revealed, <br /> <br />مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ أُوْلِي قُرْبَى مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَابُ الْجَحِيمِ <br /> <br />It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the Mushrikin, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire.) <br /> <br />Concerning Abu Talib, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَأءُ <br /> <br />Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.&#34; (28&#59;56) <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Sulayman bin Buraydah said that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Prophet came to Makkah, he went to a grave, sat next to it, started talking and then stood up with tears in his eyes. We said, `O Allah's Messenger! We saw what you did.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />إِنِّي اسْتَأْذَنْتُ رَبِّي فِي زِيَارَةِ قَبْرِ أُمِّي فَأَذِنَ لِي وَاسْتَأْذَنْتُهُ فِي الاْسْتِغْفَارِ لَهَا فَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لِي <br /> <br />I asked my Lord for permission to visit the grave of my mother and He gave me permission. I asked for His permission to invoke Him for forgiveness for her, but He did not give me permission. <br /> <br />We never saw him more tearful than on that day.&#34;' <br /> <br />Al-Awfi narrated from Ibn Abbas about Allah's statement, <br />مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ <br /> (It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the <b>Mushrikin</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet wanted to invoke Allah for forgiveness for his mother, but Allah did not allow him.
