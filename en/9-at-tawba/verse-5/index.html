But if they attack you, then fight them. (2&#59;191) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />وَخُذُوهُمْ <br /> <br />and capture them, <br /> <br />executing some and keeping some as prisoners, <br /> <br />وَاحْصُرُوهُمْ وَاقْعُدُواْ لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ <br /> <br />and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush, <br /> <br />do not wait until you find them. Rather, seek and besiege them in their areas and forts, gather intelligence about them in the various roads and fairways so that what is made wide looks ever smaller to them. This way, they will have no choice, but to die or embrace Islam, <br /> <br />فَإِن تَابُواْ وَأَقَامُواْ الصَّلَةَ وَاتَوُاْ الزَّكَاةَ فَخَلُّواْ سَبِيلَهُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if they repent and perform the <b>Salah</b>, and give the <b>Zakah</b>, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr As-Siddiq used this and other honorable <b>Ayat</b> as proof for fighting those who refrained from paying the <b>Zakah</b>. <br /> <br />These <b>Ayat</b> allowed fighting people unless, and until, they embrace Islam and implement its rulings and obligations. <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the most important aspects of Islam here, including what is less important. Surely, the highest elements of Islam after the Two Testimonials are the prayer, which is the right of Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, then the <b>Zakah</b>, which benefits the poor and needy. These are the most honorable acts that creatures perform, and this is why Allah often mentions the prayer and <b>Zakah</b> together. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَشْهَدُوا أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَةَ وَيُوْتُوا الزَّكَاة <br /> <br />I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establish the prayer and pay the <b>Zakah</b>. <br /> <br />This honorable <b>Ayah</b> (9&#59;5) was called the <b>Ayah</b> of the Sword, about which Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, <br /> <br />&#34;It abrogated every agreement of peace between the Prophet and any idolator, every treaty, and every term.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas commented&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;No idolator had any more treaty or promise of safety ever since Surah <b>Bara'ah</b> was revealed. The four months, in addition to, all peace treaties conducted before <b>Bara'ah</b> was revealed and announced had ended by the tenth of the month of <b>Rabi Al-Akhir</b>.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 4" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 6" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
