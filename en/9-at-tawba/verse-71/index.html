(3&#59;104) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَةَ وَيُوْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ <br /> <br />they perform the <b>Salah</b>, and give the <b>Zakah</b>, <br /> <br />they obey Allah and are kind to His creation, <br /> <br />وَيُطِيعُونَ اللّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ <br /> <br />and obey Allah and His Messenger, <br /> <br />concerning what he commands and refraining from what he prohibits, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />Allah will have mercy on them. <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah will give mercy to those who have these qualities, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ عَزِيزٌ <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, <br /> <br />He grants glory to those who obey Him, for indeed, might and glory is from Allah Who gives it to His Messenger and the believers, <br /> <br />حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Wise, <br /> <br />in granting these qualities to the believers, while giving evil characteristics to hypocrites. <br /> <br />Surely, Allah's wisdom is perfect in all His actions; praise and glory be to Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 70" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-70/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>71</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 72" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
