He spent large amounts and tremendous wealth on this battle (Tabuk). <br /> <br />Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdur-Rahman bin Khabbab As-Sulami said; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah gave a speech in which he encouraged spending on the army of distress (for Tabuk). <br /> <br />Uthman bin Affan, may Allah be pleased with him said; `I will give one hundred camels with their saddles and supplies.' <br /> <br />Then he exhorted them some more. So Uthman said; `I will give one hundred more camels with their saddles and supplies.' <br /> <br />Then he descended one step of the <b>Minbar</b> and exhorted them some more. So Uthman bin Affan said; `I will give one hundred more camels with their saddles and supplies.' <br /> <br />Then I saw Allah's Messenger with his hand moving like this - and Abdus-Samad's (one of the narrators) hand went out like one in amazement - he said, <br /> <br />مَا عَلَى عُثْمَانَ مَا عَمِلَ بَعْدَ هَذَا <br /> <br />It does not matter what Uthman does after. <br /> <br />It is also recorded in the <b>Musnad</b> that Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah said,&#34; <br /> <br />Uthman brought a thousand Dinars in his garment so that the Prophet could prepare supplies for the army of distress. Uthman poured the money on the Prophet's lap, and the Prophet started turning it around with his hand and declaring repeatedly, <br /> <br />مَا ضَرَّ ابْنَ عَفَّانٍ مَا عَمِلَ بَعْدَ الْيَوْم <br /> <br />The son of Affan (i.e., Uthman) will never be harmed by anything he does after today.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَلَا يَقْطَعُونَ وَادِيًا إِلاَّ كُتِبَ لَهُمْ <br /></b> (nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit), <br /> <br />&#34;The farther any people march forth away from their families in the cause of Allah, the nearer they will be to Allah.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 120" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-120/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">121</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>121</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 122" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
