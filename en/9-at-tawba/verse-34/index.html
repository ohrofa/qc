Verily, there are many of the <b>Ahbar</b> (rabbis) and the <b>Ruhban</b> (monks) who, <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ahbar</b> are Jewish rabbis, while the <b>Ruhban</b> are Christian monks. <br /> <br />This statement is true, for <b>Ahbar</b> are Jewish rabbis, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />لَوْلَا يَنْهَـهُمُ الرَّبَّـنِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ عَن قَوْلِهِمُ الاِثْمَ وَأَكْلِهِمُ السُّحْتَ <br /> <br />Why do not the <b>Ahbar</b> (rabbis) and the religious learned men forbid them from uttering sinful words and eating unlawful things. (5&#59;63) <br /> <br />The <b>Ruhban</b> are Christian monks or worshippers, while the <b>`Qissisun'</b> are their scholars. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />ذلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَاناً <br /> <br />This is because among them, there are <b>Qissisin</b> and <b>Ruhban</b>... (5&#59;82) <br /> <br />This Ayah warns against corrupt scholars and misguided worshippers. <br /> <br />Sufyan bin Uyaynah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Those among our scholars who become corrupt are similar to the Jews, while those among our worshippers who become misguided are like Christians.&#34; <br /> <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> declares, <br /> <br />لَتَرْكَبُنَّ سُنَنَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ حَذْوَ القُذَّةِ بِالْقُذَّة <br /> <br />You will follow the ways of those who were before you, step by step. <br /> <br />They asked, &#34;Jews and Christians?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <b> <br />فَمَن <br /></b> (Who else)! <br /> <br />In another narration, they asked, &#34;Persia and Rome?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />فَمَنِ النَّاسِ إِلاَّ هَوُلَاءِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And who else if it was not them? <br /> <br />These texts warn against imitating them in action and statement, for they, as Allah stated, <br /> <br />لَيَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ النَّاسِ بِالْبَاطِلِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. <br /> <br />They sell the religion in return for worldly gains, using their positions and status among people to illegally devour their property. <br /> <br />For instance, the Jews were respected by the people of <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and collected gifts, taxes and presents from them. <br /> <br />When Allah sent His Messenger, the Jews persisted in their misguidance, disbelief and rebellion, hoping to keep their status and position. However, Allah extinguished all this and took it away from them with the light of Prophethood and instead gave them disgrace and degradation, and they incurred the anger of Allah, the Exalted. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. <br /> <br />Therefore, they illegally devour people's property and hinder them from following the truth. <br /> <br />They also confuse truth with falsehood and pretend before their ignorant followers that they call to righteousness. <br /> <br />The true reality is that they call to the Fire and will not find any helpers on the Day of Resurrection. <br /><b>Torment of Those Who hoard Gold and Silver</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ الذَّهَبَ وَالْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And those who hoard (Kanz) gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah, announce unto them a painful torment. <br /> <br />This is the third category of leaders, for people rely on their scholars, worshippers and the wealthy among them. When these categories of people become corrupt, the society in general becomes corrupt. <br /> <br />Ibn Al-Mubarak once said, <br /> <br />&#34;What corrupted the religion, except kings and wicked <b>Ahbar</b> and <b>Ruhban</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />As for <b>Kanz</b>, it refers to the wealth on which <b>Zakah</b> has not been paid, according to Malik, who narrated this from Abdullah bin Dinar from Ibn Umar that. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Az-Zuhri said that Khalid bin Aslam said that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;This was before <b>Zakah</b> was ordained. When <b>Zakah</b> was ordained, Allah made it a cleanser for wealth.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar bin Abdul-`Aziz and Irak bin Malik said that this <b>Ayah</b> was abrogated by Allah's statement, <br /> <br />خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً <br /> <br />Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth. (9&#59;103) <br /> <br />There are many <b>Hadiths</b> that admonish hoarding gold and silver. We will mention here some of these <b>Hadiths</b>. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded a <b>Hadith</b> from Ali about Allah's statement, <br />وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ الذَّهَبَ وَالْفِضَّة <br /> (And those who hoard up gold and silver...) Ali said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br /> تَبًّا لِلذَّهَبٍ تَبًّا لِلْفِضَّة <br /> <br />Woe to gold! Woe to silver. <br /> <br />He repeated this statement thrice, and this <b>Hadith</b> was hard on the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, who said, &#34;What type of wealth should we use!&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;I will find out for you,&#34; and he asked, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! Your statement was hard for your Companions.
