(48&#59;25) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَمَا اسْتَقَامُواْ لَكُمْ فَاسْتَقِيمُواْ لَهُمْ <br /> <br />So long as they are true to you, stand you true to them, <br /> <br />if they keep the terms of the treaties you conducted with them, including peace between you and them for ten years, <br /> <br />فَاسْتَقِيمُواْ لَهُمْ <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />then stand you true to them. Verily, Allah loves those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah and the Muslims preserved the terms of the treaty with the people of Makkah from the month of <b>Dhul-Qa`dah</b> in the sixth year (of Hijrah), until the Quraysh broke it and helped their allies, Banu Bakr, against Khuza`ah, the allies of Allah's Messenger. <br /> <br />Aided by the Quraysh, Banu Bakr killed some of Bani Khuza`ah in the Sacred Area! The Messenger of Allah led an invasion army in the month of <b>Ramadan</b>, of the eighth year, and Allah opened the Sacred Area for him to rule over them, all thanks are due to Allah. <br />The Messenger of Allah freed the Quraysh who embraced Islam after they were overpowered and defeated. These numbered around two thousands, and they were referred to by the name <b>`Tulaqa</b>' afterwards. <br />Those among them who remained in disbelief and ran away from Allah's Messenger were sent promises of safe refuge for four months, during which they were allowed to move about freely. They included Safwan bin Umayyah, Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl and many others. Allah later on guided them to Islam, and they became excellent believers. <br /> <br />Surely, Allah is worthy of all praise for all His actions and decrees</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 6" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 8" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=9,sura_dir="at-tawba",count_ayat=129,number_aya=7;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
