Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. <br /> <br />وَسَتَلْقَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ فَيَسْأَلُكُمْ عَنْ أَعْمَالِكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. <br /> <br />أَلَا لَا تَرْجِعُوا بَعْدِي ضُلَّلاً يَضْرِبُ بَعْضُكُمْ رِقَابَ بَعْضٍ أَلَا <br /> <br /> <br />Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. <br /> <br />هَلْ بَلَّغْتُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Have I conveyed? <br /> <br />أَلَا لِيُبَلِّغِ الشَّاهِدُ مِنْكُمُ الْغَايِبَ فَلَعَلَّ مَنْ يُبَلِّغُهُ يَكُونُ أَوْعَى لَهُ مِنْ بَعْضِ مَنْ سَمِعَه <br /> <br />It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In a small book collected by Shaykh Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma' Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that; <br /><b>Muharram</b> is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness. This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. <br /> <br />The author said, &#34;...and <br /><b>Safar</b> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying <b>`Safir'</b> a place, it means to leave it... <br /><b>Rabi Al-Awwal</b> is called that because they used to do <b>Irtiba</b> in it, that is to maintain one's property... and <br /><b>Rabi Al-Akhir</b>, was so named for the same reasons. <br /><b>Jumada</b> is called that because the water would dry up (<b>Jamud</b>) then....They say <b>Jumada Al-Uwla</b> and <b>Al-Awwal</b>, or <b>Jumada Al-Akhar</b> or <b>Al-Akhirah</b>. <br /><b>Rajab</b> comes from <b>Tarjib</b>, meaning to honor. <br /><b>Shaban</b> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <br /><b>Ramadan</b> was so named because of the severity of the <b>Ramda</b>' - that is - the heat, and they say that the branch <b>Ramadat</b> when it is thirsty...And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that...&#34; <br /><b>The Sacred Months</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br /> مِنْهَا أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ <br /> <br />of them four are sacred. <br /> <br />The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />ثَلَثَةٌ مُتَوَالِيَاتٌ ذُو الْقَعْدَةِ وَذُو الْحِجَّةِ وَالْمُحَرَّمُ وَرَجَبُ مُضَرَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ جُمَادَى وَشَعْبَان <br /> <br />Three are in succession; <b>Dhul-Qa`dah</b>, <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b> and <b>Muharram</b>, and (the fourth is) <b>Rajab</b> (of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between <b>Jumada</b> (<b>Ath-Thani</b>)) and <b>Shaban</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet said &#34;<b>Rajab</b> of Mudar&#34; to attest to the custom of <b>Mudar</b>, in saying that <b>Rajab</b> is the month that is between <b>Jumada</b> and <b>Shaban</b>, not as the tribe of Rabiah thought, that it is between <b>Shaban</b> and <b>Shawwal</b>, which is <b>Ramadan</b> in the present calendar. <br /> <br />The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b> are performed with ease. <br /><b>Dhul-Qadah</b>, the month before the <b>Hajj</b> month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. <br /><b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of <b>Hajj</b>, during which they performed <b>Hajj</b> rituals. <br /><b>Muharram</b>, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety (after performing <b>Hajj</b>). <br /><b>Rajab</b>, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform <b>Umrah</b> and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ <br /> <br />That is the right religion, <br /> <br />that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah's order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَلَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ <br /> <br />so wrong not yourselves therein, <br /> <br />during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. <br /> <br />Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <br />and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment. (22&#59;25) <br /> <br />Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn Abbas said, Allah's statement, <br />إِنَّ عِدَّةَ الشُّهُورِ عِندَ اللّهِ <br /> (Verily, the number of months with Allah...), is connected to <b> <br />فَلَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ <br /></b> (so wrong not yourselves therein), <br /> <br />&#34;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said about Allah's statement, <b> <br />فَلَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ <br /></b> (so wrong not yourselves therein), <br /> <br />&#34;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#34; <br /> <br />He also said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the <b>Masajid</b> above other areas of the earth, <b>Ramadan</b> and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and <b>Laylatul-Qadr</b> (The Night of Decree) above all nights. <br /> <br />Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#34; <br /><b>Fighting in the Sacred Months</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقَاتِلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَأفَّةً <br /> <br />and fight against the idolators collectively, (all of you), <br /> <br />كَمَا يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ كَأفَّةً <br /> <br />as they fight against you collectively, (all of them), <br /> <br />وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But know that Allah is with those who have <b>Taqwa</b>, <br /> <br />and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تُحِلُّواْ شَعَأيِرَ اللَّهِ وَلَا الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month. (5&#59;2) <br /> <br />الشَّهْرُ الْحَرَامُ بِالشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْحُرُمَـتُ قِصَاصٌ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (<b>Qisas</b>). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him. (2&#59;194) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا انسَلَخَ الَاشْهُرُ الْحُرُمُ فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ <br /> <br />Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators... (9&#59;5) <br /> <br />As for Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَقَاتِلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَأفَّةً كَمَا يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ كَأفَّةً <br /> <br />And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively, <br /> <br />it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />الشَّهْرُ الْحَرَامُ بِالشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْحُرُمَـتُ قِصَاصٌ <br /> <br />The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (<b>Qisas</b>). (2&#59;194) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَا تُقَـتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ حَتَّى يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَـتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ <br /> <br />And fight not with them at <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. (2&#59;191) <br /> <br />As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta'if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta'if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it (the Sacred Month) is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 35" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-35/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التوبة<span class="num-ar">9</span> :<span class="num-ar">36</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Taubah<span> 9</span>:<span>36</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> At-Taubah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tawba Verse 37" href="/en/9-at-tawba/verse-37/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
