He said&#59; <br />فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُوْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَا أَن يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا <br /> (his parents were believers, and we feared he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief). <br /> <br />Their love for him might make them follow him in disbelief. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;His parents rejoiced when he was born and grieved for him when he was killed. If he had stayed alive, he would have been the cause of their doom. So let a man be content with the decree of Allah, for the decree of Allah for the believer, if he dislikes it, is better for him than if He were to decree something that he likes for him.&#34; <br /> <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> says; <br /> <br />لَاا يَقْضِي اللهُ لِلْمُوْمِنِ مِنْ قَضَاءٍ إِلاَّ كَانَ خَيْرًا لَه <br /> <br />Allah does not decree anything for the believer except it is good for him. <br /> <br />And Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْيًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ <br /> <br />and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you. (2&#59;216) <br /> <br />فَأَرَدْنَا أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْرًا مِّنْهُ زَكَاةً وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْمًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 79" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الكهف<span class="num-ar">18</span> :<span class="num-ar">80</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Kahf<span> 18</span>:<span>80</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 81" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-81/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
