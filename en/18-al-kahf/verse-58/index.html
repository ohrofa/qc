And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment. (13&#59;6) <br /> <br />And there are many <b>Ayat</b> which say the same thing. <br /> <br />Then Allah tells us that He is patient, He conceals faults and forgives sins. He may guide some of them from wrongdoing to true guidance, and whoever continues in his evil ways, then there will come to him a Day when infants will turn grey and every pregnant female will shed her load. <br /> <br />He says&#59; <br /> <br />بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُوا مِن دُونِهِ مَوْيِلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no escape. <br /> <br />meaning, they will find no way out</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 57" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الكهف<span class="num-ar">18</span> :<span class="num-ar">58</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Kahf<span> 18</span>:<span>58</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 59" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
