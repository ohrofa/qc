They wanted him to sit with them on his own, but Allah forbade him from doing that, and said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَطْرُدِ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ <br /> <br />And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon. (6&#59;52) <br /> <br />Allah commanded him to patiently content himself with sitting with those people (the weak believers), and said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ <br /> <br /> <br />And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon... <br /> <br />Imam Muslim recorded in his <b>Sahih</b> that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas who said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;There was a group of six of us with the Prophet. The idolators said, `Tell these people to leave so they will not offend us.' <br /> <br />There was myself, Ibn Mas`ud, a man from Hudayl, Bilal and two other men whose names I have forgotten. <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger thought to himself about whatever Allah willed he should think about, then Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَطْرُدِ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ <br /> <br />And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face). (6&#59;52) <br /> <br />Only Muslim reported this; excluding Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />وَلَا تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />`(this means) do not favor others over them, meaning do not seek the people of nobility and wealth instead of them.' <br /> <br />وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا <br /> <br />and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, <br /> <br />means, those who are distracted by this world from being committed to the religion and from worshipping their Lord. <br /> <br />وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ <br /> <br />and who follows his own lusts, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and whose affair (deeds) has been lost. <br /> <br />means, his actions and deeds are a foolish waste of time. Do not obey him or admire his way or envy what he has. <br /> <br />As Allah says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَى مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ زَهْرَةَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى <br /> <br />And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them, the splendor of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.
