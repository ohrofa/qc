Therefore, do not enter into controversies over them, nor seek information about them from any of them;</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>They will say, “Three, and their fourth being their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number.” None knows them except a few. So do not argue concerning them except with an obvious argument, and do not consult any of them about them.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>They will say, that is, [some of] those disputing the number of the youths [of the cave] at the time of the Prophet (s), in other words, some of these will say that they [the youths] were&#59; `Three; their dog the fourth of them'; and they, some [others] among them, will say, `Five; their dog the sixth of them' -- both of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najrn -- guessing at random, in other words, out of supposition, not having been present with them [at the time], and this [statement `guessing at random'] refers back to both sayings, and is in the accusative because it is an object denoting reason, in other words, [they said this] for the reason that they were [merely] supposing it. And they, that is, the believers, will say, `Seven; and their dog the eighth of them' (the sentence is [part of] the subject clause, the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab`a, `seven' [namely, thminuhum, `the eighth of them'] with the additional ww [wa- thminuhum], which is said to be for emphasis, or an indication that the adjective is [semantically] attached to that which it is qualifying). The qualification of the first two sayings as being `random', but not the third, is proof that [the latter] is the satisfactory and correct [number]. Say&#59; `My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few'&#59; Ibn `Abbs said, `I am [one] of these &#34;few&#34; [described]', and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner [of contention], [except] with that which has been revealed to you, and do not question concerning them, do not ask for opinions [from], any of them, [from] the People of the Scripture, the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him [the Prophet] about the story of the People of the Cave, and so he said to them, `I will tell you about it tomorrow', but without adding [the words], `If God wills' (insh'a' Llhu) and so the following was revealed&#59;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Their Number</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُم <br /> <br />They say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and they say they were five, the dog being the sixth, guessing at the unseen; and they say they were seven, and the dog being the eighth. <br /> <br />Allah tells us that people disputed over the number of the people of the Cave. The <b>Ayah</b> mentions three views, proving that there was no fourth suggestion. Allah indicates that the first two opinions are invalid, by saying, <br />رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ <br /> (guessing at the unseen), meaning that they spoke without knowledge, like a person who aims at an unknown target -- he is hardly likely to hit it, and if he does, it was not on purpose. <br /> <br />Then Allah mentions the third opinion, and does not comment on it, or He affirms it by saying, <br />وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ <br /> (and the dog being the eighth), indicating that this is correct and this is what happened. <br /> <br />سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ <br /> <br />قُل رَّبِّي أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;My Lord knows best their number...&#34; <br /> <br />indicating that the best thing to do in matters like this is to refer knowledge to Allah, because there is no need to indulge in discussing such matters without knowledge. If we are given knowledge of a matter, then we may talk about it, otherwise we should refrain. <br /> <br />مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّا قَلِيلٌ <br /> <br />none knows them but a few. <br /> <br />of mankind. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of the few mentioned in this <b>Ayah</b>; they were seven.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj also narrated that Ata' Al-Khurasani narrated from him, <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of those referred to in this <b>Ayah</b>,&#34; <br /> <br />and he would say&#59;&#34;Their number was seven.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59;<b> <br />مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّا قَلِيلٌ <br /></b> (none knows them but a few), <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of the few, and they were seven.&#34; <br /> <br />The chains of these reports narrated from Ibn Abbas, which say that they were seven, are <b>Sahih</b>, and this is in accordance with what we have stated above. <br /> <br />فَلَ تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلاَّ مِرَاء ظَاهِرًا <br /> <br />So debate not except with the clear proof. <br /> <br />meaning, gently and politely, for there is not a great deal to be gained from knowing about that. <br /> <br />وَلَا تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِم مِّنْهُمْ أَحَدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And consult not any of them (about the people of the Cave). <br /> <br />meaning, `They do not have any knowledge about it except what they make up, guessing at the unseen; they have no evidence from an infallible source. But Allah has sent you, O Muhammad, with the truth in which there is no doubt or confusion, which is to be given priority over all previous books and sayings.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 21" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الكهف<span class="num-ar">18</span> :<span class="num-ar">22</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Kahf<span> 18</span>:<span>22</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 23" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=18,sura_dir="al-kahf",count_ayat=110,number_aya=22;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
