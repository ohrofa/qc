Let one of you go to the city with this silver (coin) and let him search for one who has the purest food and bring provision from it. Let him be courteous, but let no one sense it is you.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>Likewise, We woke them that they might question one another. A speaker among them said: &#34;How long have you stayed (here)&#34; They said: &#34;We have stayed a day or part of a day.&#34; They said: &#34;Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed (here). So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, and let him find out which is the Azka food, and bring some of that to you. And let him be careful and let no man know of you.&#34;</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3><span>21</span> Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>In the course of time, We raised them up again so that they might question one another. One of them asked, &#34;How long have you stayed [here]?&#34; They said, &#34;We have stayed a day, or part of a day.&#34; But others said, &#34;Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed here. Let one of you go then with these silver coins to the town, and let him find out what food is purest there, and bring you back a supply of it. Let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone:</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>Even so, We awakened them, so that they may ask one another. A speaker among them said, “How long have you stayed?” They said, “We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed.” “Send one of you to the city, with this money of yours, and let him see which food is most suitable, and let him bring you some provision thereof. And let him be gentle, and let no one become aware of you.”</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And so, just as We did with them that which We have mentioned, it was that We aroused them, We awakened them, that they might question one another, concerning their state and the length of their stay [in the cave]. One of them said, `How long have you tarried?' They said, `We have tarried a day, or part of a day'&#59; [he said this] because they had entered the cave at sunrise and were awakened at sunset, and so they thought that it was [the time of] sunset on the day of their entry. Then, they said, unsure about this [fact], `Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours (read bi-warqikum or bi-wariqikum) to the city -- which is said to be the one now called Tarsus (Tarass) -- and let him see which is the purest food, that is, which of the foods of the city is the purest, and [let him] bring you a supply thereof. Let him be careful and not make anyone aware of you.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Their awakening and sending One of Themselves to buy Food</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِيَتَسَاءلُوا بَيْنَهُمْ قَالَ قَايِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ <br /> <br />Likewise, We woke them that they might question one another. A speaker among them said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah says&#59;`just as We caused them to sleep, We resurrected them with their bodies, hair and skin intact, and nothing lacking in their form and appearance.' This was after three hundred and nine years. This is why they asked each other, <br /> <br />كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ <br /> <br />How long have you stayed (here), <br /> <br />meaning, `how long have you slept!' <br /> <br />قَالُوا لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;We have stayed a day or part of a day.&#34; <br /> <br />because they entered the cave at the beginning of the day, and they woke up at the end of the day, which is why they then said, <br /> <br />أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />قَالُوا رَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثْتُمْ <br /> <br />&#34;...or a part of a day.&#34; They said&#59;&#34;Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed...&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, `Allah knows best about your situation.' <br /> <br />It seems that they were not sure about how long they had slept, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Then they turned their attention to more pressing matters, like their need for food and drink, so they said&#59; <br /> <br />فَابْعَثُوا أَحَدَكُم بِوَرِقِكُمْ <br /> <br />So send one of you with this silver coin of yours, <br /> <br />They had brought with them some Dirhams (silver coins) from their homes, to buy whatever they might need, and they had given some in charity and kept some, so they said&#59; <br /> <br />فَابْعَثُوا أَحَدَكُم بِوَرِقِكُمْ هَذِهِ إِلَى الْمَدِينَةِ <br /> <br />So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, <br /> <br />meaning to their city, which they had left. The definite article indicates that they were referring to a known city. <br /> <br />فَلْيَنظُرْ أَيُّهَا أَزْكَى طَعَامًا <br /> <br />and let him find out which is the <b>Azka</b> food. <br /><b>Azka</b> means &#34;purest&#34;, as Allah says elsewhere, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَى مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَداً <br /> <br />And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure (Zaka) from sins. (24&#59;21) <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن تَزَكَّى <br /> <br /> <br />Indeed whosoever purifies himself (Tazakka) shall achieve success. (87&#59;14) <br /> <br />From the same root also comes the word <b>Zakah</b>, which makes one's wealth good and purifies it. <br /> <br />فَلْيَأْتِكُم بِرِزْقٍ مِّنْهُ <br /> <br />and bring some of that to you. <br /> <br />وَلْيَتَلَطَّفْ <br /> <br />And let him be careful, <br /> <br />meaning when he goes out buying food and coming back. <br /> <br />They were telling him to conceal himself as much as he could, <br /> <br />وَلَا يُشْعِرَنَّ بِكُمْ أَحَدًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 18" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الكهف<span class="num-ar">18</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Kahf<span> 18</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Kahf Verse 20" href="/en/18-al-kahf/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=18,sura_dir="al-kahf",count_ayat=110,number_aya=19;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
