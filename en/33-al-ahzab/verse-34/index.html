For the revelation did not come to the Messenger of Allah in the bed of any of his wives except hers, as he stated. Some of the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This was because he did not marry any other virgin besides her, and no man slept with her in her bed before him, may Allah be pleased with her.&#34; <br /> <br />So it was befitting that she should be singled out for this blessing and high status. But if his wives are members of his household, then this title is even more fitting for his own relatives. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Jamilah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Al-Hasan bin Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both, was appointed as Khalifah when Ali was killed.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;While he was praying, a man leapt on him and stabbed him with a dagger.&#34; <br /> <br />Hussein claimed that he heard that the one who stabbed him was a man from Banu Asad, and Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him, was prostrating at the time. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;They claimed that he received the wound in his hip. He was ill as a result for many months, then he recovered. He ascended the Minbar and said&#59;`O people of Iraq! Have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah concerning us, for we are your leaders and your guests, and we are members of the family (<b>Ahl Al-Bayt</b>) concerning whom Allah said&#59;<b> <br />إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا <br /></b> (Allah wishes only to remove <b>Ar-Rijs</b> from you, O members of the family, and to purify you with a thorough purification).' He kept saying this until there was no one left in the <b>Masjid</b> who was not weeping and sobbing.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفًا خَبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things. <br /> <br />means, `by His kindness towards you, you have reached this status, and by His knowledge of you and that you are qualified for that status, He has given this to you and singled you out for it.' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;And remember how Allah blessed you by causing the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and <b>Al-Hikmah</b> to be recited in your houses, so give thanks to Allah for that and praise Him. <br /><b> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفًا خَبِيرًا <br /></b>(Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things). <br /> <br />means, `He is kind towards you, for He has caused the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and <b>Al-Hikmah</b> to be recited in your houses,' <br /> <br />and <b>Al-Hikmah</b> means the <b>Sunnah</b>. <br /> <br />And He is Well-Acquainted with you means, `He chose you as wives for His Messenger.' <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br />وَاذْكُرْنَ مَا يُتْلَى فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ مِنْ ايَاتِ اللَّهِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ <br /> (And remember, that which is recited in your houses of the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and <b>Al-Hikmah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;He is reminding them of His favor.&#34; <br /> <br />This was narrated by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />Atiyah Al-`Awfi commented on the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;<b> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفًا خَبِيرًا <br /></b> (Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things). <br /> <br />&#34;He knows when and where to reveal <b>Al-Hikmah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim, then he said&#59;&#34;This was also narrated from Ar-Rabi` bin Anas from Qatadah.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 33" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">34</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>34</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 35" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-35/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
