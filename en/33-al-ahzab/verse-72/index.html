But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust and ignorant. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Amanah</b> means obedience. This was offered to them before it was offered to Adam, and they could not bear it. Then Allah said to Adam&#59; <br /> <br />`I have offered the <b>Amanah</b> to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they could not bear it. Will you take it on!' <br /> <br />He said, `O Lord, what does it involve!' <br /> <br />He said, `If you do good, you will be rewarded, and if you do evil, you will be punished.' <br /> <br />So Adam took the <b>Amanah</b> and bore it, and this is what is referred to in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَحَمَلَهَا الاِْنسَانُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ ظَلُومًا جَهُولاً <br /> (But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust and ignorant.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Amanah</b> means <b>Al-Fara'id</b> (the obligatory duties). Allah offered them to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, (on the grounds that) if they fulfilled them, He would reward them; and if they failed, He would punish them. But they did not want to do that, and they were afraid of it, not because their intention was sinful, but because of their respect for the religion of Allah, in case they could not fulfill the obligations involved. Then Allah offered it to Adam, and he accepted it with all that it entailed. This is what is referred to in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَحَمَلَهَا الاِْنسَانُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ ظَلُومًا جَهُولاً <br /> (But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust and ignorant). <br /> <br />meaning, he underestimated the command of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others that <b>Al-Amanah</b> means <b>Al-Fara'id</b>. <br /> <br />Others said that it meant obedience. <br /> <br />Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Ad-Duha from Masruq that Ubayy bin Ka`b said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Part of <b>Al-Amanah</b> means that woman was entrusted with her own chastity.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Amanah</b> means religion, obligatory duties and prescribed punishments.&#34; <br /> <br />Malik narrated that Zayd bin Aslam said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Al-Amanah</b> means three things&#59; <br /> <br />prayer, <br /> <br />fasting and <br /> <br />performing Ghusl to cleanse oneself from sexual impurity.&#34; <br /> <br />There is no contradiction between all of these views; they are all in agreement and all refer to responsibility and the acceptance of commands and prohibitions with their attendant conditions, which is that the one who fulfills this responsibility, will be rewarded; while the one who neglects it, will be punished. Man accepted this despite the fact that he is weak, ignorant and unjust -- except for those whom Allah helps, and Allah is the One Whose help we seek. <br /> <br />One of the reports which deal with <b>Al-Amanah</b> is the <b>Hadith</b> recorded by Imam Ahmad from Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah told us two Hadiths, one of which I have seen and the other I am still waiting to see. <br /> <br />He told us that <b>Al-Amanah</b> is deeply rooted in the heart of man, then the Qur'an was revealed and they know it from the Qur'an and from the <b>Sunnah</b>. <br /> <br />Then he told us that <b>Al-Amanah</b> will be taken away. <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />يَنَامُ الرَّجُلُ النَّوْمَةَ فَتُقْبَضُ الاَْمَانَةُ مِنْ قَلْبِهِ فَيَظَلُّ أَثَرُهَا مِثْلَ أَثَرِ الْمَجْلِ كَجَمْرٍ دَحْرَجْتَهُ عَلَى رِجْلِكِ تَرَاهُ مُنْتَبِرًا وَلَيْسَ فِيهِ شَيْء <br /> <br />A man may sleep and <b>Al-Amanah</b> will be taken from his heart, leaving nothing but a trace like a blister left by a coal if you were to roll it over your leg -- you will see it protruding but there is nothing inside. <br /> <br />Then he took a pebble and rolled it over his leg, then he said&#59; <br /> <br />فَيُصْبِحُ النَّاسُ يَتَبَايَعُونَ لَا يَكَادُ أَحَدٌ يُوَدِّي الاَْمَانَةَ حَتَّى يُقَالَ إِنَّ فِي بَنِي فُلَنٍ رَجُلً أَمِينًا حَتَّى يُقَالَ لِلرَّجُلِ مَا أَجْلَدَهُ وَأَظْرَفَهُ وَأَعْقَلَهُ وَمَا فِي قَلْبِهِ حَبَّةُ خَرْدَلٍ مِنْ إِيمَان <br /> <br />Then the people will start buying and selling, and hardly anyone will be paying attention to <b>Al-Amanah</b>, until it will be said that among the tribe of so-and-so there is a trustworthy man, and it will said of a man, `how strong he is, how nice and how wise,' and there is not even a mustard seed of faith in his heart. <br /> <br />No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, or Jew, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today, I do not deal except with such and such person among you.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> from the <b>Hadith</b> of Al-A`mash. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَرْبَعٌ إِذَا كُنَّ فِيكَ فَلَ عَلَيْكَ مَا فَاتَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا حِفْظُ أَمَانَةٍ وَصِدْقُ حَدِيثٍ وَحُسْنُ خَلِيقَةٍ وَعِفَّةُ طُعْمَة <br /> <br />There are four things, if you attain them, then whatever you miss in this world will not matter&#59; <br /> <br />preserving trust, <br /> <br />speaking the truth, <br /> <br />being of good character and <br /> <br />moderation in eating. <br /><b>The Result of taking on the Amanah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 71" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-71/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">72</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>72</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 73" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-73/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=33,sura_dir="al-ahzab",count_ayat=73,number_aya=72;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
