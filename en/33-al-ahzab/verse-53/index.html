for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of Allah or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allah an enormity.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>O believers, enter not the houses of the Prophet, except leave is given you for a meal, without watching for its hour. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have had the meal, disperse, neither lingering for idle talk; that is hurtful to the Prophet, and he is ashamed before you; but God is not ashamed before the truth. And when you ask his wives for any object, ask them from behind a curtain; that is cleaner for your hearts and theirs. It is not for you to hurt God's Messenger, neither to marry his wives after him, ever; surely that would be, in God's sight, a monstrous thing.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Believers, do not enter the Prophet’s apartments for a meal unless you are given permission to do so; do not linger until [a meal] is ready. When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God’s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God’s eyes.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>O Ye who believe! enter not the houses of the Prophet, except when leave is given you, for a meal and at a time that ye will have to wait for its preparation; but when ye are invited, then enter, and when ye have eaten, then disperse, without lingering to enter into familiar discourse. Verily that incommodeth the Prophet, and he is shy of asking you to depart, bur Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them aught, ask it of them from behind a curtain.

This is one of the cases where the revelation confirmed the opinion of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, as it was reported in the Two Sahihs that he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;My view coincided with that of my Lord in three things. <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah, why do you not take <b>Maqam</b> Ibrahim as a place of prayer!' Then Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى <br />And take you (people) the <b>Maqam</b> (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer. (2&#59;125) <br /> <br />And I said, `O Messenger of Allah, both righteous and immoral people enter upon your wives, so why do you not screen them!' Then Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b>. <br /> <br />And I said to the wives of the Prophet when they conspired against him out of jealousy, <br />عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ <br /> (It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you) (66&#59;5), and this is what Allah revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />In a report recorded by Muslim, the prisoners of <b>Badr</b> are mentioned, and this is a fourth matter in which the view of Umar coincided with that of his Lord. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Umar bin Al-Khattab said&#59; <br /> <br />`O Messenger of Allah, both righteous and immoral people enter upon you, so why not instruct the Mothers of the believers to observe <b>Hijab</b>!' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah married Zaynab bint Jahsh, he invited the people to eat, then they sat talking. When he wanted to get up, they did not get up. When he saw that, he got up anyway, and some of them got up, but three people remained sitting. The Prophet wanted to go in, but these people were sitting, then they got up and went away. <br /> <br />I came and told the Prophet that they had left, then he came and entered. <br /> <br />I wanted to follow him, but he put the screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا لَاا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبِيِّ إِلاَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَى طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ وَلَكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَادْخُلُوا فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَانتَشِرُوا <br /> <br />O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse...&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Then Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet married Zaynab bint Jahsh with (a wedding feast of) meat and bread. I sent someone to invite people to the feast, and some people came and ate, then left. Then another group came and ate, and left. I invited people until there was no one left to invite. <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah, I cannot find anyone else to invite.' <br /> <br />He said, <br />ارْفَعُوا طَعَامَكُم <br /> (Take away the food). <br /> <br />There were three people left who were talking in the house. The Prophet went out until he came to the apartment of A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and he said, <br />السَّلَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُه <br /> (May peace be upon you, members of the household, and the mercy and blessings of Allah). <br /> <br />She said, `And upon you be peace and the mercy of Allah. How did you find your (new) wife, O Messenger of Allah May Allah bless you.' <br /> <br />He went round to the apartments of all his wives, and spoke with them as he had spoken with A'ishah, and they spoke as A'ishah had spoken. Then the Prophet came back, and those three people were still talking in the house. <br /> <br />The Prophet was extremely shy, so he went out and headed towards A'ishah's apartment. <br /> <br />I do not know whether I told him or someone else told him when the people had left, so he came back, and when he was standing with one foot over the threshold and the other foot outside, he placed the curtain between me and him, and the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b> was revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari among the authors of the Six Books, apart from An-Nasa'i, in Al-Yaum wal-Laylah. <br /> <br />لَاا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبِيِّ <br /> <br />Enter not the Prophet's houses, <br /> <br />the believers were prohibited from entering the houses of the Messenger of Allah without permission, as they used to do during the <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and at the beginning of Islam, until Allah showed His jealousy over this <b>Ummah</b> and commanded them to seek permission. This is a sign of His honoring this <b>Ummah</b>. Hence the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِيَّاكُمْ وَالدُّخُولَ عَلَى النِّسَاء <br /> <br />Beware of entering upon women... <br /> <br />Then Allah makes an exception, when He says&#59; <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَى طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ <br /> <br />unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Qatadah and others said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This means, without waiting for the food to be prepared.&#34; <br /> <br />In other words, do not watch the food as it is being cooked to see if it is nearly ready, then come and enter the house, because this is one of the things that Allah dislikes and condemns. This indicates that it is forbidden to watch out for food being prepared, which is what the Arabs called <b>Tatfil</b> (being an uninvited guest). <br /> <br />Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi wrote a book condemning those who watch out for food being prepared, and mentioned more things about this topic than we can quote here. <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَادْخُلُوا فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَانتَشِرُوا <br />. <br /> <br />But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse, <br /> <br />In <b>Sahih</b> Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا دَعَا أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ فَلْيُجِبْ عُرْسًا كَانَ أَوْ غَيْرَه <br /> <br />When anyone of you invites his bother, let him respond, whether it is for a wedding or for any other reason.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />.. <br />وَلَا مُسْتَأْنِسِينَ لِحَدِيثٍ <br /> <br />without sitting for a talk. <br /> <br />meaning, as those three people did who stayed behind and chatted, and forgot themselves to such an extent that this caused inconvenience for the Messenger of Allah as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ يُوْذِي النَّبِيَّ فَيَسْتَحْيِي مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />Verily, such (behavior) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); <br /> <br />It was said that what was meant was, your entering his houses without permission causes him inconvenience and annoyance, but he did not like to forbid them to do so because he felt too shy,' until Allah revealed that this was forbidden. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ لَاا يَسْتَحْيِي مِنَ الْحَقِّ <br /> <br />but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. <br /> <br />meaning, `this is why He is forbidding and prohibiting you from doing that.' <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاء حِجَابٍ <br /> <br />And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, <br /> <br />meaning, `just as it is forbidden for you to enter upon them, it is forbidden for you to look at them at all. If anyone of you has any need to take anything from them, he should not look at them, but he should ask for whatever he needs from behind a screen.' <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ <br /> <br />that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. <br /><b>Prohibition of annoying the Messenger and the Statement that His Wives are Unlawful for the Muslims</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُوْذُوا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَن تَنكِحُوا أَزْوَاجَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَبَدًا إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said concerning the <b>Ayah</b>; <br />وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُوْذُوا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ <br /> (And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger), <br /> <br />&#34;This was revealed concerning a man who wanted to marry one of the wives of the Prophet after he died. <br /> <br />A man said to Sufyan, `Was it A'ishah!' <br /> <br />He said, `That is what they said.&#34;' <br /> <br />This was also stated by Muqatil bin Hayyan and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />He also reported with his chain of narration from As-Suddi that the one who wanted to do this was Talhah bin Ubaydullah, may Allah be pleased with him, until this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed forbidding that. <br /> <br />Hence the scholars were unanimous in stating that it was forbidden for anyone to marry any of the women who were married to the Messenger of Allah at the time when he died, because they are his wives in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the Mothers of the believers, as stated previously. Allah regarded that as a very serious matter, and issued the sternest of warnings against it, as He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَظِيمًا <br /> <br />Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity. <br /> <br />Then He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِن تُبْدُوا شَيْيًا أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 52" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">53</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>53</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 54" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-54/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=33,sura_dir="al-ahzab",count_ayat=73,number_aya=53;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
