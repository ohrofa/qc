And (O ladies) have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Witness over everything. <br /> <br />When Allah commands women to observe <b>Hijab</b> in front of men to whom they are not related, He explains who are the relatives before whom they do not need to observe <b>Hijab</b>. This is like the exceptions stated in Surah <b>An-Nur</b>, where Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَأيِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَأءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَأيِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَأءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى أَخَوَتِهِنَّ أَوْ نِسَأيِهِنَّ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُهُنَّ أَوِ التَّـبِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِى الاِرْبَةِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ أَوِ الطِّفْلِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَى عَوْرَتِ النِّسَأءِ <br /> <br />And not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or their right hand possessions, or the <b>Tabi`in</b> among men who do not have desire, or small children who are not aware of the nakedness of women. (24&#59;31) <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> contains more detail than this, which we have already discussed in the Tafsir of the <b>Ayah</b> and do not need to repeat here. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ash-Sha`bi and Ikrimah said concerning the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />لاَّا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِنَّ فِي ابَايِهِنَّ <br /> (It is no sin on them before their fathers...), <br /> <br />I said, &#34;What about the paternal uncle and the maternal uncle -- why are they not mentioned!&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Because they may describe her to their sons, so it is disliked for a woman to remove her covering in front of her paternal uncle or maternal uncle.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلَا نِسَايِهِنَّ <br /> (or their own women), <br /> <br />means that they do not have to observe <b>Hijab</b> in front of other believing women. <br /> <br />وَلَا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ <br /> (or their (female) slaves. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This means female slaves only.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. <br /> <br />وَاتَّقِينَ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And (O ladies) have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Witness over everything. <br /> <br />means, and fear Him in private and in public, for He witnesses all things and nothing is hidden from Him, so think of the One Who is always watching</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 54" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-54/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">55</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>55</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 56" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-56/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
