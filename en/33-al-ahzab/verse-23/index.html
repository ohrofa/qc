I did not find it with anyone except Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, whose testimony the Messenger of Allah counted as equal to that of two other men. The <b>Ayah</b> in question was&#59;<b> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ <br /></b> <br />صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah;)&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari but not by Muslim, <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the chapters on Tafsir in their <b>Sunans</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;We think that this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed concerning Anas bin An-Nadr, may Allah be pleased with him&#59;<b> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ <br /></b> <br />صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah).&#34; <br /> <br />This was reported only by Al-Bukhari, but there are corroborating reports with other chains of narration. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;My paternal uncle Anas bin Al-Nadr, may Allah be pleased with him, after whom I was named, was not present with this Messenger of Allah at <b>Badr</b>, and this distressed him. He said&#59; <br /> <br />`The first battle at which the Messenger of Allah was present, and I was absent; if Allah shows me another battle with the Messenger of Allah, Allah will see what I will do!' <br /> <br />He did not want to say more than that. He was present with the Messenger of Allah at <b>Uhud</b>, where he met Sa`d bin Mu`adh, may Allah be pleased with him. <br /> <br />Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said to him, `O Abu `Amr! Where are you going?' <br /> <br />He replied, `I long for the fragrance of Paradise and I have found it near the mountain of <b>Uhud</b>.' <br /> <br />He fought them until he was killed, may Allah be pleased with him. Eighty-odd stab wounds and spear wounds were found on his body, and his sister, my paternal aunt Ar-Rabayyi` bint Al-Nadr said, `I only recognized my brother by his fingertips.' <br /> <br />Then this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed&#59; <br /> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلً <br /> <br /> <br />Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah; of them some have fulfilled their Nahbah; and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed in the least. <br /> <br />They used to think that it had been revealed concerning him and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir narrated that Musa bin Talhah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say&#59; <br /> <br />طَلْحَةُ مِمَّنْ قَضَى نَحْبَه <br /> <br />Talhah is one of those who have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Mujahid said concerning the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ <br /> (of them some have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;Their covenant, <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ <br /> (and some of them are still waiting), <br /> <br />they are waiting for battle so that they can do well. &#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ <br /> (of them some have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;They died true to their covenant and loyal, and some are still waiting to die in a similar manner, and some of them have never changed in the least.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. <br /> <br />Some of them said that the word <b>Nahbah</b> means a vow. <br /> <br />وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلً <br /> (but they have never changed in the least). <br /> <br />means, they never changed their covenant or were disloyal or committed treachery, but they persisted in what they had promised and did not break their vow, unlike the hypocrites who said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا عَوْرَةٌ وَمَا هِىَ بِعَوْرَةٍ إِن يُرِيدُونَ إِلاَّ فِرَارا <br /> <br />&#34;Truly, our homes lie open.&#34; And they lay not open. They but wished to flee.
