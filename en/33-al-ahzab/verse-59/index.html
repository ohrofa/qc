Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their <b>Jalabib</b> over their bodies. <br /> <br />Here Allah tells His Messenger to command the believing women -- especially his wives and daughters, because of their position of honor -- to draw their <b>Jilbabs</b> over their bodies, so that they will be distinct in their appearance from the women of the <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and from slave women. <br /> <br />The <b>Jilbab</b> is a <b>Rida</b>', worn over the <b>Khimar</b>. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, Ubaydah, Qatadah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ata' Al-Khurasani and others. <br /> <br />It is like the <b>Izar</b> used today. <br /> <br />Al-Jawhari said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Jilbab</b> is the outer wrapper.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />Allah commanded the believing women, when they went out of their houses for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with the <b>Jilbab</b>, leaving only one eye showing. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Sirin said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked Ubaydah As-Salmani about the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَبِيبِهِنَّ <br /> (to draw their <b>Jalabib</b> over their bodies). He covered his face and head, with just his left eye showing.&#34; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ أَدْنَى أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَ يُوْذَيْنَ <br /> <br />That will be better that they should be known so as not to be annoyed. <br /> <br />means, if they do that, it will be known that they are free, and that they are not servants or whores. <br /> <br />وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />means, with regard to what happened previously during the days of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, when they did not have any knowledge about this. <br /><b>A Stern Warning to the Evil Hypocrites</b> <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 58" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 60" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
