Yet blood relations are closer to one another according to God's decree, more than (other) believers and the emigrants (who left their homes in the cause of God), but you should be kind to your friends. This is inscribed in the Book (of decrees).</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3>Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>The Prophet is closer to the Muslims than their own lives, and his wives are their mothers; and the relatives are closer to each other in the Book of Allah, than other Muslims and immigrants, except that you may be kind towards your friends; this is written in the Book.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3>Ali Ünal</h3><p>The Prophet has a higher claim on the believers than they have on their own selves, and (seeing that he is as a father to them) his wives are (as) their mothers. Those who are bound by blood have a greater right (in inheritance and charity) upon one another according to God’s Book than other believers and the Emigrants – except that you must (nevertheless) act with kindness toward your friends (and bequeath some of your goods to them). That is what is written in the Book (of God’s Decree).</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>The Prophet has a better claim on the believers than (that) they even have on themselves.

And those related by blood, kinsmen, are more entitled, to inherit [from], one another in the Book of God than the [other] believers and the Emigrants, in other words, than inheriting on account of [their sharing] faith and the Emigration, which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends, by [making] a bequest, which is permissible. This, namely, the abrogation of inheritance on account of [shared] faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship, is written in the Book -- in both instances al-kitb, `the Book', denotes the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfz).</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Loyalty to the Prophet ; and his wives are Mothers of the Believers</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells us how His Messenger is merciful and sincere towards his <b>Ummah</b>, and how he is closer to them than they are to themselves. His judgement or ruling takes precedence over their own choices for themselves, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَ وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ حَتَّى يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً <br /> <br />But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept with full submission. (4&#59;65) <br /> <br />In the <b>Sahih</b> it says&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَاا يُوْمِنُ أَحَدُكُمْ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ وَمَالِهِ وَوَلَدِهِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِين <br /> <br />By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, none of you truly believes until I am dearer to him than his own self, his wealth, his children and all the people. <br /> <br />It was also reported in the <b>Sahih</b> that Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except myself.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />لَاا يَا عُمَرُ حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ نَفْسِك <br /> <br />No, O Umar, not until I am dearer to you than yourself. <br /> <br />Umar said&#59;&#34;O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, now you are dearer to me than everything, even myself.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />الاْنَ يَاعُمَر <br /> <br />Now, O Umar (you have got it right). <br /> <br />Allah says in this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves, <br /> <br />Concerning this <b>Ayah</b>, Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ مُوْمِنٍ إِلاَّ وَأَنَا أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاْاخِرَةِ اقْرَوُوا إِنْ شِيْتُمْ <br /> <br />There is no believer except I am the closest of all people to him in this world and in the Hereafter. Recite, if you wish&#59;<b> <br />النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ <br /></b> (The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves). <br /> <br />فَأَيُّمَا مُوْمِنٍ تَرَكَ مَالاًأ فَلْيَرِثْهُ عُصْبَتُهُ مَنْ كَانُوا وَإِنْ تَرَكَ دَيْنًا أَوْ ضِيَاعًا فَلْيَأْتِنِي فَأَنَا مَوْلَاأه <br /> <br />If any believer leaves behind any wealth, let his own relatives inherit it, but if he leaves behind any debt or orphans, bring them to me and I will take care of them. <br /> <br />This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, and he also recorded it in the Book of Loans. <br /> <br />وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ <br /> <br />and his wives are their mothers. <br /> <br />means, they are unlawful for marriage. <br /> <br />In terms of honor, respect and veneration, it is not permissible for them to be alone with them, and the prohibition of marriage to them does not extend to their daughters and sisters, according to scholarly consensus. <br /> <br />وَأُوْلُو الاْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ <br /> <br />And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the decree of Allah than the believers and the Muhajirin, <br /> <br />This is an abrogation of the rule that existed previously, whereby they could inherit from one another by virtue of the oath of brotherhood among them. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and others said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;A Muhajir would inherit from an Ansari even though they were not related by blood, because of the brotherhood established between them by the Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also stated by Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among scholars of the earlier and later generations. <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن تَفْعَلُوا إِلَى أَوْلِيَايِكُم مَّعْرُوفًا <br /> <br />except that you do kindness to those brothers. <br /> <br />means, the idea of inheriting from one another has gone, but there remains the duty to offer support and kindness, to uphold ties of brotherhood and to offer good advice. <br /> <br />كَانَ ذَلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This has been written in the Book. <br /> <br />This ruling, which is that those who are blood relatives have closer personal ties to one another, is a ruling which Allah has decreed and which is written in the First Book which cannot be altered or changed. <br /> <br />This is the view of Mujahid and others. <br /> <br />(This is the case) even though Allah legislated something different at certain times, and there is wisdom behind this, for He knew that this would be abrogated and the original ruling that was instituted an eternity ago would prevail, and this is His universal and legislative decree. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 5" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 7" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
