If a man declared his wife as unlawful for him as the ẓahr (back) of his mother, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this type of divorce (see {58&#58;3}-4). ]] Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real children.[[ The following distinction should be made&#58;Sponsorship (which is permissible)&#58; a person can sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters. For example, adopted children keep their last names, are allowed to marry the children of their adopted parent, adopted and biological children of the opposite sex should dress modestly in front of each other, and do not have a share in the estate of their adopted parents, but can get a share of inheritance (up to one-third of the estate) through bequest (waṣiyah). Adoption&#58; a person is not allowed to take an orphan and give them his/her last name, give them a share of inheritance similar to their own children, etc. ]] These are only your baseless assertions.

An atonement with [necessary] conditions is necessary in such a case, as mentioned in srat al-Mujdila [Q. 58&#59;2-3]. Nor has He made those whom you claim as [adopted] sons (ad`iy', the plural of da`iyy, which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his [biological] father) your sons, in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths, namely, [of] the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet (s) married Zaynab bt. Jahsh, who had been Zayd b. Hritha's wife, the adopted son of the Prophet (s), they said, `Muhammad married his son's wife!', and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth, in this [matter], and He guides to the way, the way of truth.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>Abolition of Adoption</b> <br /> <br />Before Allah discusses ideas and theoretical matters, He gives tangible examples&#59;one man cannot have two hearts in his body, and a man's wife does not become his mother if he says the words of <b>Zihar</b> to her&#59;&#34;You are to me like the back of my mother.&#34; By the same token, an adopted child does not become the son of the man who adopts him and calls him his son. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَاجَكُمُ اللَّايِي تُظَاهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ <br /> <br />Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers' backs, your real mothers... <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />مَّا هُنَّ أُمَّهَـتِهِمْ إِنْ أُمَّهَـتُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللَّيِى وَلَدْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />They cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. (58&#59;2) <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَاءكُمْ أَبْنَاءكُمْ <br /> <br />nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. <br /> <br />This was revealed concerning Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Prophet. The Prophet had adopted him before Prophethood, and he was known as Zayd bin Muhammad. Allah wanted to put an end to this naming and attribution, as He said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَاءكُمْ أَبْنَاءكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. <br /> <br />This is similar to the <b>Ayah</b> later in this <b>Surah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَأ أَحَدٍ مّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَـكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً <br /> <br /> <br />Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything. (33&#59;40) <br /> <br />And Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُم بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ <br /> <br />That is but your saying with your mouths. <br /> <br />meaning, `your adoption of him is just words, and it does not mean that he is really your son,' for he was created from the loins of another man, and a child cannot have two fathers just as a man cannot have two hearts in one body. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِي السَّبِيلَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the way. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ <br /> (But Allah says the truth) means, justice. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَهُوَ يَهْدِي السَّبِيلَ <br /> (and He guides to the way) means, the straight path. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad said that Hasan told them that Zuhayr told them from Qabus, meaning Ibn Abi Zibyan, that his father told him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;I said to Ibn Abbas, `Do you know the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ <br /> (Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body). What does this mean?' <br /> <br />He said that the Messenger of Allah stood up one day to pray, and he trembled. The hypocrites who were praying with him said, <br /> <br />`Do you not see that he has two hearts, one heart with you and another with them.' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed the words&#59; <br />مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ <br /> (Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body).&#34; <br /> <br />This was also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, who said, &#34;It is a <b>Hasan Hadith</b>&#34;. <br /> <br />It was also narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from the Hadith of Zuhayr. <br /><b>An Adopted Child should be named after His Real Father</b> <br /> <br />Allah commands;</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 3" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 5" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=33,sura_dir="al-ahzab",count_ayat=73,number_aya=4;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
