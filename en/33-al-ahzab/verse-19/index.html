Then when the fightin cometh, thou beholdest them look unto thee, their eyes rolling about, like the eyes of him who fainteth unto death.

Whenever there is danger, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling as though they were on the verge of fainting at the approach of death. But when the danger passes away, their greed for wealth prompts them to greet you with their sharp, scissor-like tongues. These are the ones who never truly believed, and so Allah has caused their deeds to be reduced to naught.

But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man's in the swoon of death.

So when (danger threatens in battle and) fear comes, you see them (O Messenger) looking to you (for help), their eyes rolling (in terror) like the eyes of one who swoons to death. But once (the battle subsides and) fear departs, they assail you with sharp tongues, being avaricious for (a share in) the goods thereof (the gainings of victory). Those have never (truly) believed, and therefore God has caused their deeds to come to nothing. That is ever easy for God.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>They are niggardly (having no desire) to help you.

But when (the time of) danger passes away they lash you (tauntingly) with the sharp (edges of their) tongues being niggardly of any good (coming to your way). These people have never, infact, believed (sincerely), so Allâh has rendered void all their activities (against Islam).

And when fear approaches, you see them staring at you—their eyes rolling—like someone fainting at death. Then, when panic is over, they whip you with sharp tongues. They resent you any good.

And when there is a panic, you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like one, that is, like the look of one, or the rolling of one, fainting at death, in other words, [one] in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides, and the spoils have been secured, they scald you, they hurt you, or they smite you, with [their] sharp tongues, in their greed for the riches, in other words, for the spoils, which they demand [greedily]. Those, they never believed, really. Therefore God has invalidated their works, and that, invalidation, is easy for God, by His will.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />they come not to the battle except a little, being miserly towards you. <br /> <br />i.e., `they are mean and have no love or mercy towards you.' <br /> <br />As-Suddi said&#59; <br /><b> <br />أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ <br /></b> (Being miserly towards you). means, with the booty. <br /> <br />فَإِذَا جَاء الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدُورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِي يُغْشَى عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ <br /> <br />Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like one over whom hovers death; <br /> <br />means, because of the intensity of their fear and terror; this is how afraid these cowards are of fighting. <br /> <br />فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ <br /> <br />but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, <br /> <br />means, when security is restored, they will speak eloquently and nicely, claiming that they were the bravest and most chivalrous of men, but they are lying. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br />سَلَقُوكُم <br /> (they will smite you) means, <br /> <br />&#34;they will start to talk about you.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;But when it comes to the booty, the most miserly of people and the worst to have to share the booty with are those who say, `Give us, give us, we were there with you,' but during battle they were the most cowardly and the most likely to fail to support the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />أَشِحَّةً عَلَى الْخَيْرِ <br /> <br />are miserly towards good, <br /> <br />meaning that there is no goodness in them, for they have combined cowardice with lies and little good. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ لَمْ يُوْمِنُوا فَأَحْبَطَ اللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 18" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 20" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=33,sura_dir="al-ahzab",count_ayat=73,number_aya=19;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
