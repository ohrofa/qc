As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself, they saw that he had no such inflammation (udra is an inflammation of the testicle). And he was distinguished in God's sight. An instance of our Prophet (s) being subjected to hurt was when [on one occasion] while dividing up the spoils a man said to him, `This is a division that I do not want to please God!', whereat the Prophet (s) became angered and said, `May God have mercy upon Moses, for truly he was hurt with worse than this, but endured' -- reported by al-Bukhr.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Fabrications of the Jews against Musa</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded in the Book of Hadiths about the Prophets, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ كَانَ رَجُلً حَيِيًّا سِتِّيرًا لَا يُرَى مِنْ جِلْدِهِ شَيْءٌ اسْتِحْيَاءً مِنْهُ فَأذَاهُ مَنْ اذَاهُ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ فَقَالُوا مَا يَتَسَتَّرُ هَذَا التَّسَتُّرَ إِلاَّ مِنْ عَيْبٍ فِي جِلْدِهِ إِمَّا بَرَصٌ وَإِمَّا أُدْرَةٌ وَإِمَّا افَةٌ وَإِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُبَرِّيَهُ مِمَّا قَالُوا لِمُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَمُ فَخَلَ يَوْمًا وَحْدَهُ فَخَلَعَ ثِيَابَهُ عَلَى حَجَرٍ ثُمَّ اغْتَسَلَ فَلَمَّا فَرَغَ أَقْبَلَ إِلَى ثِيَابِهِ لِيَأْخُذَهَا وَإِنَّ الْحَجَرَ عَدَا بِثَوْبِهِ فَأَخَذَ مُوسَى عَصَاهُ وَطَلَبَ الْحَجَرَ فَجَعَلَ يَقُولُ ثَوْبِي حَجَرُ ثَوْبِي حَجَرُ حَتْى انْتَهَى إِلَى مَلٍَ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ فَرَأَوْهُ عُرْيَانًا أَحْسَنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَأَبْرَأَهُ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ وَقَامَ الْحَجَرُ فَأَخَذَ ثَوْبَهُ فَلَبِسَهُ وَطَفِقَ بِالْحَجَرِ ضَرْبًا بِعَصَاهُ فَوَاللهِ إِنَّ بِالْحَجَرِ لَنَدَبًا مِنْ أَثَرِ ضَرْبِهِ ثَلَثًا أَوْ أَرْبَعًا أَوْ خَمْسًا قَالَ فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا لَاا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ اذَوْا مُوسَى فَبَرَّأَهُ اللَّهُ مِمَّا قَالُوا وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Musa, peace be upon him, was a shy and modest man who would never show anything of his skin because of his shyness. Some of the Children of Israel annoyed him by saying&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;He only keeps himself covered because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia or some other defect.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah, may He be glorified, wanted to clear Musa, peace be upon him, of what they were saying. One day Musa was alone, so he took off his garment and put it on a rock, then he took a bath. When he had finished, he turned back to pick up his garment, but the rock moved away, taking his garment with it. <br /> <br />Musa picked up his stick and chased the rock, saying, &#34;My garment, O rock! My garment, O rock!&#34; Until he reached a group of the Children of Israel, who saw him naked and found that he was the best of those whom Allah had created. Thus he was cleared of what they had said about him. Then the rock stood still, so he took his garment and put it on. He started hitting the rock with his stick, and by Allah, the marks of that beating were left on the rock, three or four or five. <br /> <br />This is what is referred to in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />O you who believe! Be not like those who annoyed Musa, but Allah cleared him of that which they alleged, and he was honorable before Allah. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is one of those which were recorded by Al-Bukhari but not Muslim. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah (bin Mas`ud) said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;One day, the Messenger of Allah distributed some booty and a man among the Ansar said, `This division was not done for the sake of Allah.' <br /> <br />I said, `O enemy of Allah! I am going to tell the Messenger of Allah what you have said.' <br /> <br />So, I told the Prophet about it. His face reddened and he said, <br /> <br />رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَى مُوسَى لَقَدْ أُوذِيَ بِأَكْثَرَ مِنْ هَذَا فَصَبَر <br /> <br /> <br />May Allah have mercy on Musa. He was annoyed with worse than this, yet he remained patient.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded in the Two Sahihs. <br /> <br />وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهًا <br /> <br /> <br />and he was honorable before Allah. <br /> <br />means, he had a position of status and honor before his Lord, may He be exalted and glorified. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;His supplications would be answered by Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Some of them said that part of his great standing before Allah was that he interceded for his brother Harun, asking Allah to send him with him as a Messenger, and Allah granted his request and said&#59; <br /> <br />وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَأ أَخَاهُ هَـرُونَ نَبِيّاً <br /> <br />And We granted him his brother Harun, (also) a Prophet, out of Our mercy.
