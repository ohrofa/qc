So the pure and perfect Shariah came to cancel out the extremes of the Christians, and permitted marriage to the daughter of a paternal uncle or aunt, or the daughter of a maternal uncle or aunt, and forbade the excesses of the Jews who allowed marriage to the daughter of a brother or sister which is an abhorrent thing. <br /> <br />اللَّتِي هَاجَرْنَ مَعَكَ <br /> <br />who migrated with you, <br /> <br />وَامْرَأَةً مُّوْمِنَةً إِن وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِيِّ إِنْ أَرَادَ النَّبِيُّ أَن يَسْتَنكِحَهَا خَالِصَةً لَّكَ <br /> <br />and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her -- a privilege for you only, <br /> <br />means, `also lawful for you, O Prophet, is a believing woman if she offers herself to you, to marry her without a dowry, if you wish to do so.' <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> includes two conditions. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah and said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Messenger of Allah, verily, I offer myself to you (for marriage).&#34; <br /> <br />She stood there for a long time, then a man stood up and said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah, marry her to me if you do not want to marry her.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />هَلْ عِنْدَكَ مِنْ شَيْءٍ تُصْدِقُهَا إِيَّاهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do you have anything that you could give to her as a dowry? <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I have only this garment of mine.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنْ أَعْطَيْتَهَا إِزَارَكَ جَلَسْتَ لَا إِزَارَ لَكَ فَالْتَمِسْ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />If you give her your garment, you will be left with no garment. Look for something. <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I do not have anything.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الْتَمِسْ وَلَوْ خَاتَمًا مِنْ حَدِيد <br /> <br />Look for something, even if it is only an iron ring. <br /> <br />So he looked, but he could not find anything. <br /> <br />Then the Messenger of Allah said to him&#59; <br /> <br />هَلْ مَعَكَ مِنَ الْقُرْانِ شَيْءٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do you have (know) anything of the Qur'an? <br /> <br />He said, &#34;Yes, Surah such and such and Surah and such,&#34; <br /> <br />he named the Surahs. So, the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />زَوَّجْتُكَهَا بِمَا مَعَكَ مِنَ الْقُرْان <br /> <br />I marry her to you with what you know of the Qur'an. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Malik. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a narration from his father that A'ishah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The woman who offered herself to the Prophet was Khawlah bint Hakim.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I used to feel jealous of those women who offered themselves to the Prophet and I said, <br /> <br />`Would a woman offer herself When Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /><b> <br />تُرْجِي مَن تَشَاء مِنْهُنَّ وَتُوْوِي إِلَيْكَ مَن تَشَاء وَمَنِ ابْتَغَيْتَ مِمَّنْ عَزَلْتَ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكَ <br /></b> <br /> <br />(You can postpone whom you will of them, and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you desire of those whom you have set aside, it is no sin on you), <br /> <br />I said, `I see that your Lord hastens to confirm your desires.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah did not have any wife who offered herself to him.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. In other words, he did not accept any of those who offered themselves to him, even though they were lawful for him -- a ruling which applied to him alone. <br /> <br />The matter was left to his own choice, as Allah says&#59; <br />إِنْ أَرَادَ النَّبِيُّ أَن يَسْتَنكِحَهَا <br /> (and (if) the Prophet wishes to marry her), <br /> <br />meaning, if he chooses to do so. <br /> <br />خَالِصَةً لَّكَ مِن دُونِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This means, it is not permissible for anyone else to marry a woman who offers herself to him; if a woman offers herself to a man, it is not permissible for him (to marry her) unless he gives her something.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi and others. <br /> <br />In other words, if a woman offers herself to a man, when he consummates the marriage, he has to give her a dowry like that given to any other woman of her status, as the Messenger of Allah ruled in the case of Barwa` bint Washiq when she offered herself in marriage; the Messenger of Allah ruled that she should be given a dowry that was appropriate for a woman like her after her husband died. <br /> <br />Death and consummation are the same with regard to the confirmation of the dowry, and the giving of a dowry appropriate to the woman's status in the case of those who offer themselves to men other than the Prophet is an established ruling. With regard to the Prophet himself, he is not obliged to give a dowry to a woman who offers herself to him, even if he consummated the marriage, because he has the right to marry without a dowry, <b>Wali</b> (representative) or witnesses, as we have seen in the story of Zaynab bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, concerning the <b>Ayah</b>&#59;<b> <br />خَالِصَةً لَّكَ مِن دُونِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /></b> (a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers), <br /> <br />no woman has the right to offer herself to any man without a <b>Wali</b> or a dowry, except to the Prophet. <br /> <br />قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا فَرَضْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِي أَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ <br /> <br />Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (servants) whom their right hands possess, <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ibn Jarir said, concerning the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا فَرَضْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِي أَزْوَاجِهِمْ <br /> (Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives), <br /> <br />means, `concerning the limiting of their number to four free women, and whatever they wish of slave-girls, and the conditions of a representative, dowry and witnesses to the marriage. This is with regard to the <b>Ummah</b> (the people), but We have granted an exemption in your case and have not imposed any of these obligations upon you.' <br /> <br />لِكَيْلَ يَكُونَ عَلَيْكَ حَرَجٌ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Ahzab Verse 49" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">50</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>50</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Ahzab Verse 51" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-51/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=33,sura_dir="al-ahzab",count_ayat=73,number_aya=50;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
