The Prophet was sitting with his wives around him, and he was silent. <br /> <br />Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I will tell the Prophet something to make him smile.' <br /> <br />Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `O Messenger of Allah, if only you had seen the daughter of Zayd -- the wife of Umar -- asking me to spend on her just now; I broke her neck!' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen, and he said, <br />هُنَّ حَوْلِي يَسْأَلْنَنِي النَّفَقَة <br /> (They are around me asking me to spend on them). <br /> <br />Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, got up to deal with A'ishah; and Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, got up to deal with Hafsah, and both of them were saying, `You are asking the Prophet for that which he does not have!' <br /> <br />But the Messenger of Allah stopped them, and they (his wives) said, `By Allah, after this we will not ask the Messenger of Allah for anything that he does not have.' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b> telling him to give them the choice, and he started with A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her. <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />إِنِّي أَذْكُرُ لَكِ أَمْرًا مَا أُحِبُّ أَنْ تَعْجَلِي فِيهِ حَتَّى تَسْتَأْمِرِي أَبَوَيْك <br /> <br />I am going to tell you something, and I would like you not to hasten to respond until you consult your parents. <br /> <br />She said, `What is it.' <br /> <br />He recited to her&#59; <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لاَِّزْوَاجِكَ <br /> (O Prophet! Say to your wives)... <br /> <br />A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `Do I need to consult my parents concerning you I choose Allah and His Messenger, but I ask you not to tell of my choice to your other wives.' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى لَمْ يَبْعَثْنِي مُعَنِّفًا وَلَكِنْ بَعَثَنِي مُعَلِّمًا مُيَسِّرًا لَا تَسْأَلُنِي امْرَأَةٌ مِنْهُنَّ عَمَّا اخْتَرْتِ إِلاَّ أَخْبَرْتُهَا <br /> <br />Allah did not send me to be harsh, but He sent me to teach in a gentle and easy manner. If any of them asks me what your decision was, I will tell her.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim, but not Al-Bukhari; An-Nasa'i also recorded it. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said&#59;&#34;At that time he was married to nine women, five of them were from Quraysh -- <br /> <br />A'ishah, <br /> <br />Hafsah. <br /> <br />Umm Habibah, <br /> <br />Sawdah and <br /> <br />Umm Salamah, (may Allah be pleased with them). <br /> <br />And he was also married to <br /> <br />Safiyyah bint Huyay An-Nadariyyah, <br /> <br />Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyyah, <br /> <br />Zaynab bint Jahsh Al-Asadiyyah and <br /> <br />Juwayriyyah bint Al-Harith Al-Mustalaqiyyah, (may Allah be pleased with all of them).</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 28" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 30" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
