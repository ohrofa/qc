when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, &#34;Keep your wife and fear Allah,&#34; while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="ahmedali"><h3>Ahmed Ali</h3><p>When you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: &#34;Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,&#34; you were hiding something God was about to bring to light, for you had fear of men, though you should fear God more. And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them. God's command is to be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3>Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And O dear Prophet, remember when you said to him upon whom Allah has bestowed favour and you had bestowed favour, “Keep your wife with you, and fear Allah”, and you kept in your heart what Allah willed to make known, and you feared criticism from the people; and Allah has more right that you should fear Him; so when Zaid became unconcerned with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no sin upon believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have become unconcerned with them; and the command of Allah must be carried out.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3>Ali Ünal</h3><p>(Remember) when you (O Messenger) said to him whom God has favored (with guidance to Islam and close companionship with the Prophet), and whom you have favored (with kind treatment, special consideration, and emancipation): &#34;Retain your wife in marriage and fear God (concerning your treatment of her).&#34; You were hiding within yourself what God (had already decreed and) would certainly bring to light: you were feeling apprehensive of people (that they might react in a way harmful to their faith), while God has a greater right that you should fear Him (lest you err in the implementation of His commands). So, when Zayd had come to the end of his union with her (and she had completed her period of waiting after the divorce), We united you with her in marriage, so that there should be no blame (or legal impediment) for the believers in respect of (their marrying) the wives of those whom they called their sons (though they really were not), when the latter have come to the end of their union with them. And God’s command must be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>And (recall the time) when you said to the man (- Zaid son of Hârithah, a slave freed by the Prophet) on whom Allâh had bestowed His favour and whom you also had favoured, `Keep your wife (- Zainab) to yourself (and do not divorce her) and take Allâh as a shield. And you (O Zaid!) conceal (the cause of the failure of the marriage) in your mind, what Allâh is going to bring to light (that the responsibility of the failure rests more upon Zaid than upon Zainab); and you are (also) afraid of the people whereas Allâh has a better right that you should stand in awe of Him.´ However when Zaid had done what he intended to do with her (- his wife and dissolved the marriage tie with her), We gave her (- the divorced lady) in marriage to you, so that the believers might incur no blame in (getting married to) the wives of their adopted sons after they had dissolved the marriage tie with them. Indeed, the decree of Allâh is ever executed.</p></div><div id="arberry"><h3>  A. J. Arberry</h3><p>When thou saidst to him whom God had blessed and thou hadst favoured, 'Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God,' and thou wast concealing within thyself what God should reveal, fearing other men; and God has better right for thee to fear Him. So when Zaid had accomplished what he would of her, then We gave her in marriage to thee, so that there should not be any fault in the believers, touching the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished what they would of them; and God's commandment must be performed.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3>Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And recall what time thou wast saying unto him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou hadst conferred favour: keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah; so and thou wast concealing in thy mind that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing mankind, whereas Allah had a better right that Him thou shouldst fear. Then when Zaid had performed his purpose concerning her, We wedded her to thee, that there should be no blame for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when they have performed their purpose concerning them.

So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah's Command must be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3>Talal Itani</h3><p>When you said to him whom God had blessed, and you had favored, “Keep your wife to yourself, and fear God.” But you hid within yourself what God was to reveal.

Then, when Zaid ended his relationship with her, We gave her to you in marriage, that there may be no restriction for believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons, when their relationship has ended. The command of God was fulfilled.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3>English Literal</h3><p>And when you say to who God blessed/comforted and eased on (to) him, and you blessed/comforted and eased on (to) him: &#34;Hold/grasp on (to) you your wife, and fear and obey God.&#34; And you hide in your self what God (is) showing it (E), and you fear the people, and God (is) more worthy/deserving that (E)301you fear Him, so when Zeyd carried out/ended from her a need/desire (divorced) We made you marry her, so that (there) not be on the believers hardship/blame in wives/spouses (of their adopted) ones called after them, if they carried out/ended from them (F) a need/desire (divorced), and God`s order/command was/is made/done.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3>Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>(O Prophet), call to mind when you said to him whom Allah had favoured and you had favoured: “Cleave to your wife and fear Allah,” and you concealed within yourself for fear of people what Allah was to reveal, although Allah has greater right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her, We gave her in marriage to you so that there should not be any constraint for the believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons after they had accomplished whatever they would of them.

So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them.

So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3>Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>When you said to him whom Allah had blessed, and whom you [too] had blessed, ‘Retain your wife for yourself, and be wary of Allah,’ and you had hidden in your heart what Allah was to divulge, and you feared the people though Allah is worthier that you should fear Him, so when Zayd had got through with her, We wedded her to you, so that there may be no blame on the faithful in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have got through with them, and Allah’s command is bound to be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3>Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>And when you said to he whom Allah had favored and yourself have favored: 'Keep your wife and fear Allah' and you sought to hide in yourself what Allah was to reveal, fearing people; although Allah has a better right for you to fear Him.

But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and Allah's command shall be performed.</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3>Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>You said to the man who had been favoured by God and by you, &#34;Keep your wife to yourself and have fear of God.&#34; You sought to hide in your heart what God wished to reveal.

When Zayd divorced his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there should be no restriction on believers marrying the spouses of their adopted sons when they have divorced them. The commandment of God must be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3>Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour&#59; &#34;Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah.&#34; But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest&#59; thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee&#59; in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And when (idh is dependent because of [an implied preceding] udhkur, `mention [when]') you said to him to whom God had shown favour, by [guiding him to] Islam, and to whom you [too] had shown favour&#59; by manumitting him -- this was Zayd b. Hritha, who had been a prisoner of war before [the coming of] Islam (in the period of al-jhiliyya). The Messenger of God (s) purchased him before his call to prophethood, and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son -- `Retain your wife for yourself and fear God', before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose, [what] He was to manifest of your love for her and of [the fact] that should Zayd part with her you would marry her, and you feared people, would say, `He has married his son's wife!', though God is worthier that you should fear Him, in all things, so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her [obligatory] waiting period was completed. God, exalted be He, says&#59; So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her, We joined her in marriage to you -- the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without [the customary] permission [from her legal guardian] and gratified the Muslims with [a feast of] bread and meat -- so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God's commandment, that which He has decreed, is bound to be realised.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Allah's rebuke to His Messenger and the Story of Zayd and Zaynab</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ تَقُولُ لِلَّذِي أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace, <br /> <br />Allah tells what His Prophet said to his freed slave Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, who was the one on whom Allah had bestowed grace, i.e., through Islam and following the Messenger . <br /> <br />وَأَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />and you have done a favor (to him), <br /> <br />means, by freeing him from slavery. <br /> <br />And he was a great leader, held in high esteem and beloved by the Prophet. He was known as the beloved, and his son Usamah was known as the beloved son of the beloved. <br /> <br />A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah never sent him on a campaign but he appointed him as its commander, and if he had lived after him he would have appointed him as his Khalifah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Imam Ahmad. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah had given him in marriage to the daughter of his paternal aunt, Zaynab bint Jahsh Al-Asadiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, whose mother was Umaymah bint Abd Al-Muttalib. For her dowry he gave her ten Dinars, sixty Dirhams, a veil, a cloak and a shirt, fifty Mudds of food and ten Mudds of dates. <br /> <br />This was stated by Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />She stayed with him for a year, more or less, then problems arose between them. Zayd complained about her to the Messenger of Allah, who told him, <br /> <br />أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ زَوْجَكَ وَاتَّقِ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />&#34;Keep your wife to yourself, and have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا اللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى النَّاسَ وَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ <br /> <br />But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir narrated that A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, <br /> <br />&#34;If Muhammad were to have concealed anything that was revealed to him of the Book of Allah, he would have concealed this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا اللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى النَّاسَ وَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ <br /> <br />But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.&#34; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا قَضَى زَيْدٌ مِّنْهَا وَطَرًا زَوَّجْنَاكَهَا <br /> <br />So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, <br /> <br />meaning, `when her marriage to Zayd was over and he had separated from her, We married her to you,' and the One Who was her <b>Wali</b> (guardian) in this marriage was Allah Himself, in the sense that He revealed to the Prophet that he should go in unto her without any <b>Wali</b>, contractual agreement, dowry or witnesses among mankind. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When Zaynab's <b>`Iddah</b> finished, may Allah be pleased with her, the Messenger of Allah said to Zayd bin Harithah, <br /> <br />اذْهَبْ فَاذْكُرْهَا عَلَي <br /> <br />Go to her and tell her about me (that I want to marry her). <br /> <br />So, he went to her and found her kneading dough. He (Zayd) said, `When I saw her I felt such respect for her that I could not even look at her and tell her what the Messenger of Allah had said, so I turned my back to her and stepped aside, and said, `O Zaynab! Rejoice, for the Messenger of Allah has sent me to propose marriage to you on his behalf.' <br /> <br />She said, `I will not do anything until I pray to my Lord, may He be glorified.' <br /> <br />So she went to the place where she usually prayed. <br /> <br />Then Qur'an was revealed and the Messenger of Allah came and entered without permission. We were there when she entered upon the Messenger of Allah, and for the wedding feast we offered bread and meat. Then the people left, and some men stayed behind conversing in the house after they had eaten. The Messenger of Allah went out and I followed him. He started to go around all the apartments of his wives, greeting them, and they said, `O Messenger of Allah, how did you find your (new) wife!' <br /> <br />I do not know whether I or someone else told him that those people had left, so he went and entered the house, and I went to enter after him, but he drew the curtain between himself and I. <br /> <br />The ruling of <b>Hijab</b> was revealed and he exhorted the people as Allah had exhorted them&#59; <br /> <br />لَا تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتَ النَّبِىِّ إِلااَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, <br /> <br />&#34;Zaynab bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet, saying, `Your families arranged your marriages, but Allah arranged my marriage from above the seven heavens.&#34;' <br /> <br />In (our Tafsir of) Surah <b>An-Nur</b> we mentioned that Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Jahsh said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Zaynab and A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with them, were boasting to one another; Zaynab, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `I am the one whose marriage was revealed from above the heaven.' <br /> <br />A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `I am the one whose innocence was revealed from heaven.' <br /> <br />So, Zaynab conceded that, may Allah be pleased with her.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لِكَيْ لَا يَكُونَ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِي أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَايِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْا مِنْهُنَّ وَطَرًا <br /> <br />so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. <br /> <br />means, `We permitted you to marry her, and We did that so that there would no longer be any difficulty for the believers with regard to their marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons.' <br /> <br />Before Prophethood, the Messenger of Allah had adopted Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, and he was known as Zayd, the son of Muhammad. Allah put a stop to this when He said&#59; <br />وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَأءَكُمْ أَبْنَأءَكُمْ <br /> (nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons) until&#59; <br />ادْعُوهُمْ لاًّبَأيِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ <br /> (Call them after their fathers, that is more just with Allah. (33&#59;4-5), <br /> <br />Then this was confirmed and made even clearer by the marriage of the Messenger of Allah to Zaynab bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, when Zayd bin Harithah divorced her. <br /> <br />Allah says in <b>Ayat At-Tahrim</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَحَلَـيِلُ أَبْنَأيِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَـبِكُمْ <br /> <br />the wives of your sons from your own loins, (4&#59;23) <br /> <br />which specifically excludes adopted sons. This custom (of adopting sons) was widespread among them. <br /> <br />وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah's command must be fulfilled. <br /> <br />means, `this that has happened was decreed by Allah and was inevitable.' <br /> <br />Allah knew that Zaynab, may Allah be pleased with her, would become one of the wives of the Prophet</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 36" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-36/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحزاب<span class="num-ar">33</span> :<span class="num-ar">37</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahzab<span> 33</span>:<span>37</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahzab Verse 38" href="/en/33-al-ahzab/verse-38/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
