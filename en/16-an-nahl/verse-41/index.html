Allah promised them a great reward in this world and the next. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَنُبَوِّيَنَّهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً <br /> <br />We will certainly give them good residence in this world, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Ash-Sha`bi and Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />(this means) &#34;Al-Madinah.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also said that; <br /> <br />it meant &#34;good provision.&#34; <br /> <br />This was the opinion of Mujahid. <br /> <br />There is no contradiction between these two opinions, for they left their homes and wealth, but Allah compensated them with something better in this world. <br /> <br />Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah compensates him with something that is better for him than that, and this is what happened. He gave them power throughout the land and caused them to rule over the people, so they became governors and rulers, and each of them became a leader of the pious. <br /> <br />Allah tells us that His reward for the <b>Muhajirin</b> in the Hereafter is greater than that which He gave them in this world, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَاَجْرُ الاخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ <br /> <br />but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater, <br /> <br />meaning, greater than that which We have given you in this world. <br /> <br />لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />if they but knew! <br /> <br />means, if those who stayed behind and did not migrate with them only knew what Allah prepared for those who obeyed Him and followed His Messenger. <br /> <br />Then Allah describes them as&#59; <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 40" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-40/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">41</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>41</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 42" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-42/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
