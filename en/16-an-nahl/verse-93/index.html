(10&#59;99), <br /> <br />meaning, He could have created harmony among them, and there would not be any differences, conflicts or hatred between them. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَأءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ النَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ <br /> <br />And if your Lord had so willed, He would surely, have made mankind one <b>Ummah</b> (nation or community), but they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, and for that did He create them. (11&#59;118-119) <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />وَلكِن يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَاء وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />but He allows whom He wills to stray and He guides whom He wills. <br /> <br />وَلَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But you shall certainly be called to account for what you used to do. <br /> <br />i.e. on the Day of Resurrection, He will ask them all about their deeds, and will reward or punish them even equal to a scalish thread in the long slit of a date stone or the size of a speck on the back of a date stone, or even a thin membrane of the date stone. <br /><b>The Prohibition on taking an Oath for Purposes of Treachery</b> <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 92" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">93</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>93</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 94" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-94/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
