The essence of what they said was&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;If Allah hated what we did, He would have stopped by punishing us, and He would not have enabled us to do it.&#34; <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ فَعَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ <br /> <br />Those before them did the same. <br /> <br />Rejecting their confusing ideas, Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَهَلْ عَلَى الرُّسُلِ إِلاَّ الْبَلغُ الْمُبِينُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message! <br /> <br />meaning, the matter is not as you claim. It is not the case that Allah did not rebuke your behavior; rather, He did rebuke you, and in the strongest possible terms, and He emphatically forbade you from such behavior. To every nation - that is, to every generation, to every community of people - He sent a Messenger.
