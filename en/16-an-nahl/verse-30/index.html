(16&#59;97), <br /> <br />which means that whoever does good in this world, Allah will reward him for his good deeds in this world and in the next. <br /> <br />Then we are told that the home of the Hereafter will be better, <br /> <br />i.e., better than the life of this world, and that the reward in the Hereafter will be more complete than the reward in this life, as Allah says, <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ <br /> <br />But those who were given (religious) knowledge said&#59;&#34;Woe to you!

(87&#59;17) <br /> <br />Allah said to His Messenger&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَلٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الاٍّولَى <br /> <br />And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present. (93&#59;4) <br /> <br />وَلَدَارُ الاخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ <br /> <br />and the home of the Hereafter will be better. <br /> <br />Allah describes the abode of the Hereafter, saying, <br /> <br />وَلَنِعْمَ دَارُ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 29" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">30</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>30</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 31" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
