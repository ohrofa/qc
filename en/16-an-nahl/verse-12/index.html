Surely, His is the creation and commandment. <br /> <br />Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists! (7&#59;54) <br /> <br />Thus Allah says; <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, in this are proofs for people who understand. <br /> <br />meaning, they are indications of His immense power and might, for those who think about Allah and understand His signs</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 11" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 13" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=16,sura_dir="an-nahl",count_ayat=128,number_aya=12;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
