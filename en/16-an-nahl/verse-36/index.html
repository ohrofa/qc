All of the Messengers brought the same Message, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ <br /> <br />And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying)&#59;None has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (alone and none else).&#34; (21&#59;25) <br /> <br />وَاسْيلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَأ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ <br /> <br />And ask (O Muhammad) those Messengers of Ours whom We sent before you&#59;&#34;Did We ever appointed to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)&#34; (43&#59;45) <br /> <br />And in this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الطَّاغُوتَ <br /> <br />And We have indeed sent a Messenger to every <b>Ummah</b> (community, nation) (saying)&#59;&#34;Worship Allah (alone), and shun the <b>Taghut</b> (all false deities).&#34; <br /> <br />So how could any of the idolators say, <br />لَوْ شَاء اللّهُ مَا عَبَدْنَا مِن دُونِهِ مِن شَيْءٍ <br /> (If Allah had so willed, we would not have worshipped any but Him), <br /> <br />The legislative will of Allah is clear and cannot be taken as an excuse by them, because He had forbidden them to do that upon the tongue of His Messengers, but by His universal will (i.e., by which He allows things to occur even though they do not please Him). He allowed them to do that as it was decreed for them. So there is no argument in that for them. Allah created Hell and its people both the <b>Shayatin</b> (devils) and disbelievers, but He does not like His servants to disbelieve. And this point constitutes the strongest proof and the most unquestionable wisdom. <br /> <br />Then Allah informs us that He rebuked them with punishment in this world, after the Messengers issued their warning, thus He says&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللّهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّللَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِي الَارْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then among them were some whom Allah guided, and among them were some who deserved to be left to stray. So travel through the land and see the end of those who denied (the truth). <br /> <br />This means&#59;ask about what happened to those who went against the Messengers and rejected the truth, see how&#59; <br /> <br />دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا <br /> <br />Allah destroyed them completely, and a similar (end awaits) the disbelievers. (47&#59;10) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نكِيرِ <br /> <br />And indeed those before them belied (the Messengers of Allah), so then how terrible was My denial (punishment). (67&#59;18) <br /> <br />Then Allah told His Messenger <br /> <br />إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَى هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ اللّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُم مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 35" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-35/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">36</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>36</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 37" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-37/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=16,sura_dir="an-nahl",count_ayat=128,number_aya=36;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
