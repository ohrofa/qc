By God, you will indeed be questioned (a questioning of rebuke; there is a shift herein from the third [to the second] person) about what you used to fabricate, against God, such as [claiming] that He commanded you to [do] this.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Among the Behavior of the Idolators was vowing to Things that Allah had provided for Them to their gods</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ نَصِيبًا مِّمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ <br /> <br />And they assign a portion of that which We have provided them with, to what they have no knowledge of (false deities). <br /> <br />Allah tells us about some of the heinous deeds of those who used to perform baseless worship of other gods besides Him, such as idols and statues, with no grounds for doing so. They gave their idols a share of that which Allah had provided for them, <br /> <br />فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَأيِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَأيِهِمْ فَلَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَأيِهِمْ سَأءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ <br /> <br />They say&#59;&#34;This is for Allah,&#34; according to their claim,&#34; and this is for our partners.&#34; But the share of their &#34;partners&#34; is not directed to Allah, while the share of Allah is directed to their &#34;partners&#34;! How evil is that with which they judge. (6&#59;136) <br /> <br />That is they assigned a share for their idols as well as Allah, but they gave preference to their gods over Him, so Allah swore by His Almighty Self to question them about these lies and fabrications. He will most certainly call them to account for it and give them the unrelenting punishment in the fire of Hell. <br /> <br />So He says, <br /> <br />تَاللّهِ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنتُمْ تَفْتَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />By Allah, you shall certainly be questioned about (all) that you used to fabricate. <br /> <br />Then Allah tells us how they used to regard the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, as being female, and that they considered them to be Allah's daughters, and they worshipped them with Him. In all of the above, they made very serious errors. <br /> <br />They attributed offspring to Him when He has no offspring, then they assigned Him the kind of offspring they regarded as inferior, namely daughters, which they did not even want for themselves, as He said&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى <br /> <br />تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى <br /> <br />Are the males for you and the females for Him! That is indeed an unfair division! (53&#59;21-22) <br /> <br />And Allah says here</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 55" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-55/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">56</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>56</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 57" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
