He has also given them homes from the hides of cattle, i.e., leather, which are light and easy to carry on journeys and can be erected wherever they stop, whether they are traveling or are settled. <br /> <br />Thus Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />تَسْتَخِفُّونَهَا يَوْمَ ظَعْنِكُمْ وَيَوْمَ إِقَامَتِكُمْ <br /> <br />which you find so light when you travel and when you camp; <br /> <br />وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَا <br /> <br />out of their wool, fur and hair, <br /> <br />refers to sheep, camels and goats respectively. <br /> <br />أَثَاثًا <br /> <br />furnishings, <br /> <br />meaning what you take from them, i.e., wealth. <br /> <br />It was also said that it means articles of convenience, or clothing. <br /> <br />The correct view is more general in meaning than this; it means that you make carpets, clothing and other things from their wool, hair etc., which you use as wealth and for trade. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />`<b>Al-Athath</b> means articles of convenience and comfort.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah. <br /> <br />وَمَتَاعًا إِلَى حِينٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and articles of convenience - comfort for a while. <br /> <br />The phrase, <b> <br />إِلَى حِينٍ <br /></b> (for a while) means, <br /> <br />until the appointed time. <br /><b>Shade, Places of Refuge in the Mountains, Garments and Coats of Mail are also Blessings from Allah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 79" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">80</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>80</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 81" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-81/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
