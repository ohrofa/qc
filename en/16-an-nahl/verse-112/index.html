But it rejected God's graces, by denying the Prophet (s), so God made it taste the garb of hunger, and so they suffered seven years of drought, and fear, as a result of the raiding parties of the Prophet (s), [all] because of what they used to do.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Example of Makkah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَضَرَبَ اللّهُ مَثَلً قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ امِنَةً مُّطْمَيِنَّةً <br /> <br />And Allah gives the example of a township (Makkah), it was secure and peaceful&#59;its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the favors of Allah. So Allah made it taste extreme hunger (famine) and fear, because of what they did. <br /> <br />This example refers to the people of Makkah, which had been secure, peaceful and stable, a secure sanctuary while men were being snatched away from everywhere outside of it. Whoever entered Makkah, he was safe, and he had no need to fear, as Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ إِن نَّتَّبِعِ الْهُدَى مَعَكَ نُتَخَطَّفْ مِنْ أَرْضِنَأ أَوَلَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّهُمْ حَرَماً ءَامِناً يُجْبَى إِلَيْهِ ثَمَرَاتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ رِّزْقاً مِّن لَّدُنَّا <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.&#34; <br /> <br />Have We not established a secure sanctuary (Makkah) for them, to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves. (28&#59;57) <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًا <br /> <br />its provision coming to it in abundance, <br /> <br />meaning, with ease and in plenty, <br /> <br />مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ فَكَفَرَتْ بِأَنْعُمِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />from every place, but it (its people) denied the favors of Allah. <br /> <br />meaning, they denied the blessings of Allah towards them, the greatest of which was Muhammad being sent to them, as Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ بَدَّلُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ كُفْرًا وَأَحَلُّواْ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ الْبَوَارِ <br /> <br />جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا وَبِيْسَ الْقَرَارُ <br /> <br />Have you not seen those who have changed the favors of Allah into disbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the abode of destruction; Hell, in which they will burn, - and what an evil place to settle in! (14&#59;28-29). <br /> <br />Hence Allah replaced their former blessings with the opposite, and said&#59; <br /> <br />فَأَذَاقَهَا اللّهُ لِبَاسَ الْجُوعِ وَالْخَوْفِ <br /> <br />So Allah made it taste extreme hunger (famine) and fear, <br /> <br />meaning, He inflicted it and made them taste of hunger after fruits of all kinds and provision in abundance from every place had been brought to it. <br /> <br />This was when they defied the Messenger of Allah and insisted on opposing him, so he supplicated against them, asking Allah to send them seven years like the seven years of Yusuf (i.e., seven years of famine), and they were stricken with a year in which everything that they had was destroyed, and they ate <b>`Alhaz'</b>, which is the hair of the camel mixed with its blood when it is slaughtered. <br /> <br />بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْنَعُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />because of what they did. <br /> <br />وَالْخَوْفِ <br /> (and fear), <br /> <br />This refers to the fact that their sense of security was replaced with fear of the Messenger of Allah and his Companions after they had migrated to Al-Madinah. They feared the power and the attack of his armies, and they started to lose and face the destruction of everything that belonged to them, until Allah made it possible for His Messenger to conquer Makkah. This happened because of their evil deeds, their wrongdoing and their rejection of the Messenger that Allah sent to them from among themselves. <br /> <br />He reminded them of this blessing in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />لَقَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْمُومِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />Indeed, Allah blessed the believers when He sent Messenger from among themselves to them. (3&#59;164) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الَالْبَـبِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراًرَسُولاً <br /> <br />So have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah! O men of understanding who have believed, Allah has indeed revealed to you a reminder (this Qur'an). (And has also sent to you) a Messenger. (65&#59;10-11) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />كَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْكُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ ايَـتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ <br /> <br />Similarly (as a blessing), We have sent a Messenger to you from among you, reciting Our <b>Ayat</b> to you, and purifying you, and teaching you the Book (the Qur'an) and the <b>Hikmah</b> (i.e. <b>Sunnah</b>).) Until <br />وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ <br /> (and do not be ungrateful). (2&#59;151-152) <br />Allah changed the situation of the disbelievers and made it the opposite of what it had been, so they lived in fear after being secure, they were hungry after having plenty of provisions. After the believers lived in fear, Allah granted them security, giving them ample provisions after they lived in poverty, making them rulers, governors and leaders of mankind. <br /> <br />This is what we say about the example that was given of the people of Makkah. <br /> <br />It was also the opinion of Al-Awfi and Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and Malik narrated it from Az-Zuhri as well. <br /> <br />May Allah have mercy on them all. <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ جَاءهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 111" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 113" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
