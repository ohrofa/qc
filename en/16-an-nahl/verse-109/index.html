He said that; <br /> <br />he was taken prisoner by the Romans, who brought him to their king. The king said, &#34;Become a Christian, and I will give you a share of my kingdom and my daughter in marriage.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah said&#59;&#34;If you were to give me all that you possess and all that Arabs possess to make me give up the religion of Muhammad even for an instant, I would not do it.&#34; <br /> <br />The king said, &#34;Then I will kill you.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah said, &#34;It is up to you.&#34; <br /> <br />The king gave orders that he should be crucified, and commanded his archers to shoot near his hands and feet while ordering him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then the king gave orders that he should be brought down, and that a big vessel made of copper be brought and heated up. Then, while Abdullah was watching, one of the Muslim prisoners was brought out and thrown into it, until all that was left of him was scorched bones. <br /> <br />The king ordered him to become a Christian, but he still refused. Then he ordered that Abdullah be thrown into the vessel, and he was brought back to the pulley to be thrown in. <br /> <br />Abdullah wept, and the king hoped that he would respond to him, so he called him, but Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I only weep because I have only one soul with which to be thrown into this vessel at this moment for the sake of Allah; I wish that I had as many souls as there are hairs on my body with which I could undergo this torture for the sake of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />According to some reports, the king imprisoned him and deprived him of food and drink for several days, then he sent him wine and pork, and he did not come near them. Then the king called him and asked him, &#34;What stopped you from eating&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is permissible for me (under these circumstances), but I did not want to give you the opportunity to gloat.&#34; <br /> <br />The king said to him, &#34;Kiss my head and I will let you go.&#34; <br />Abdullah said, &#34;And will you release all the Muslim prisoners with me!&#34; <br />The king said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br />So Abdullah kissed his head and he released him and all the other Muslim prisoners he was holding. <br />When he came back, Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br />&#34;Every Muslim should kiss the head of Abdullah bin Hudhafah, and I will be the first to do so.&#34; <br /> <br />And he stood up and kissed his head. May Allah be pleased with them both</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 108" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-108/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النحل<span class="num-ar">16</span> :<span class="num-ar">109</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nahl<span> 16</span>:<span>109</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> An-Ni'em</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nahl Verse 110" href="/en/16-an-nahl/verse-110/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=16,sura_dir="an-nahl",count_ayat=128,number_aya=109;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
