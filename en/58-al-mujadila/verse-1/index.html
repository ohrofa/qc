And Allah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;All praise be to Allah, Who hears all voices. <br /> <br />The woman who disputed, came to the Prophet and argued with him while I was in another part of the room, unable to hear what she said. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah, <br /> <br />قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا <br /> <br />(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband.) till the end of this Ayah.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith without a chain of narration in the Book of <b>Tawhid</b> in his Sahih. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir also collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />In the narration that Ibn Abi Hatim collected, A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Blessed is He, Whose hearing has encompassed all things. I heard what Khawlah bint Tha`labah said while some of it I could not hear. She was complaining to Allah's Messenger about her husband. She said, <br /> <br />`O Allah's Messenger! He spent my wealth, exhausted my youth and my womb bore abundantly for him. When I became old, unable to bear children, he pronounced the <b>Ziharon</b> me! <br /> <br />O Allah! I complain to you.' <br /> <br />Soon after, Jibril brought down this Ayah, <br />قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا <br /> (Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband),&#34; <br /> <br />She added, &#34;Her husband was Aws bin As-Samit.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المجادلة<span class="num-ar">58</span> :<span class="num-ar">1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mujadilah<span> 58</span>:<span>1</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Eth-Thihar</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 2" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
