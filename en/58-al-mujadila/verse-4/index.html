And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty of the poor. <br /> <br />is explained by the Hadiths that prescribe these punishments in this order, just as in the Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs about the man who had sexual intercourse with his wife during the day, in Ramadan. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ لِتُوْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ <br /> <br />That is in order that you may have perfect faith in Allah and His Messenger. <br /> <br />meaning, `We legislated this punishment so that you acquire this trait,' <br /> <br />وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />These are the limits set by Allah. <br /> <br />meaning, the things that He has forbidden, so do not transgress them, <br /> <br />وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment. <br /> <br />meaning, those who do not believe and do not abide by the rulings of Islamic legislation should never think they will be saved from the torment. Rather theirs will be a painful torment in this life and the Hereafter</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 3" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المجادلة<span class="num-ar">58</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mujadilah<span> 58</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Eth-Thihar</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 5" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
