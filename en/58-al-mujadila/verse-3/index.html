I pronounced <b>Zihar</b> on my wife, but then had sexual intercourse with her before I paid the expiation.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger said, <br /> <br />مَا حَمَلَكَ عَلى ذَلِكَ يَرْحَمُكَ الله <br /> <br />May Allah grant you His mercy, what made you do that? <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I saw the adornment she was wearing shining in the moon's light.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />فَلَ تَقْرَبْهَا حَتْى تَفْعَلَ مَا أَمَرَكَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />Then do not touch her until you do what Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has ordered you to do. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ <br /> <br />(the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave, <br /> <br />indicating the necessity of freeing a slave before they touch each other. <br /> <br />This Ayah mentions any slave, not only believing servants as in the case of the expiation for (unintentional) killing, <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br />That is an admonition to you. <br /> <br />meaning, a warning to threaten you in this case. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. <br /> <br />meaning, He is All-Knower in what brings you benefit. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 2" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-2/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المجادلة<span class="num-ar">58</span> :<span class="num-ar">3</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mujadilah<span> 58</span>:<span>3</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Eth-Thihar</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 4" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
