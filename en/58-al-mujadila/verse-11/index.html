And God is Aware of what you do.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Manners for Assemblies</b> <br /> <br />Allah teaches His servants good manners and orders them to be kind to each other when they are sitting together, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا فِي الْمَجَالِسِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />When you are told to make room in the assemblies, <br /> <br />فَافْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />make room. Allah will give you room. <br /> <br />Indeed, the reward or recompense depends on the type of action. <br /> <br />In a Hadith, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَنْ بَنَىىِللهِ مَسْجِدًا بَنَى اللهُ لَهُ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّة <br /> <br />Whoever builds a <b>Masjid</b> for Allah, Allah builds for him a house in Paradise. <br /> <br />In another Hadith, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />وَمَنْ يَسَّرَ عَلى مُعْسِرٍ يَسَّرَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاْخِرَةِ وَاللهُ فِي عَوْنِ الْعَبْدِ مَا كَانَ الْعَبْدُ فِي عَوْنِ أَخِيه <br /> <br /> <br />He who relieves a difficulty for a person living in straitened circumstances, then Allah will relieve the difficulties of this life and the Hereafter for him. Surely, Allah helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother. <br /> <br />There are many similar Hadiths. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Exalted said, <br />فَافْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ <br /> (make room. Allah will give you room). <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This Ayah was revealed about gatherings in places where Allah is being remembered. When someone would come to join in assemblies with the Messenger, they would hesitate to offer them space so that they would not loose their places. Allah the Exalted commanded them to spread out and make room for each other.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and Imam Ash-Shafi`i recorded that Abdullah bin Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا يُقِمِ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ فَيَجْلِسَ فِيهِ وَلَكِنْ تَفَسَّحُوا وَتَوَسَّعُوا <br /> <br />One of you should not remove someone from his place and sit in it, but instead, spread out and make room. <br /> <br />This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا يُقِمِ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ ثُمَّ يَجْلِسُ فِيهِ وَلَكِنِ افْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللهُ لَكُم <br /> <br />A man should not remove another man from his place and then sit in it. Rather spread out and make room and Allah will make room for you. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith with the wording&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَقُومُ الرَّجُلُ لِلرَّجُلِ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ وَلَكِنِ افْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللهُ لَكُم <br /> <br />A man should not leave his place for another man, but rather spread out and make room, and Allah will make room for you. <br /> <br />It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others said that&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا فِي الْمَجَالِسِ <br /> <br />فَافْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />When you are told to make room in the assemblies, make room. Allah will give you room. <br /> <br />means to war assemblies, <br /> <br />and that, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا قِيلَ انشُزُوا فَانشُزُوا <br /> <br />And when you are told to rise up, then rise up. <br /> <br />means, &#34;Get up to fight.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said <br />وَإِذَا قِيلَ انشُزُوا فَانشُزُوا <br /> (And when you are told to rise up, then rise up). means, <br /> <br />&#34;When you are called to any type of good, then respond.&#34; <br /><b>The Virtues of Knowledge and People of Knowledge</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br /> يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah will exalt in degrees those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do. <br /> <br />means, do not think that if one of you makes room for his brother, or rises up when he is commanded to do so, that this will diminish his right or honor. Rather, this will increase his virtue and status with Allah, and Allah the Exalted will never make his good deed be lost. To the contrary, He will reward him for it in this life and the Hereafter. Surely, he who humbles himself by and before the command of his Lord, then Allah will elevate his status and make him known by his good behavior. the statement of Allah the Exalted, <br /> <br /> يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br />Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well--Acquainted with what you do. <br /> <br />meaning, surely, Allah is Aware of those who deserve this reward and those who are not worthy of it. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu At-Tufayl `Amir bin Wathilah said, <br /> <br />Nafi` bin Abdul--Harith met Umar bin Al-Khattab in the area of Usfan. Umar appointed Abu At-Tufayl to be the governor of Makkah. Umar asked him, <br /> <br />&#34;Whom did you appoint as your deputy for the valley people (that is, Makkah).&#34; <br /> <br />Amir said, &#34;I appointed Ibn Abza, one of our freed slaves, as my deputy.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;You made a freed slave their governor in your absence&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;O Leader of the faithful! He has memorized Allah's Book and has knowledge of regulations of inheritance, along with being a proficient judge.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;Surely, your Prophet has said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ يَرْفَعُ بِهذَا الْكِتَابِ قَوْمًا وَيَضَعُ بِهِ اخَرِين <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah elevates some people and degrades others, on account of this Book.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim collected this Hadith</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 10" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المجادلة<span class="num-ar">58</span> :<span class="num-ar">11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mujadilah<span> 58</span>:<span>11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Eth-Thihar</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mujadila Verse 12" href="/en/58-al-mujadila/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=58,sura_dir="al-mujadila",count_ayat=22,number_aya=11;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
