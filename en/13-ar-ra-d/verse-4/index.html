All this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills, there is no deity or lord except Him. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَجَنَّاتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ <br /> <br />and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date palms... <br /> <br />Allah's statement, next, <br /> <br />صِنْوَانٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ <br /><b>Sinwanun wa</b> (or) <b>Ghayru Sinwan</b>. <br /><b>`Sinwan'</b> means, <br /> <br />growing into two or three from a single stem, such as figs, pomegranate and dates. <br /><b>`Ghayru Sinwan'</b> means, <br /> <br />having one stem for every tree, as is the case with most plants. <br /> <br />From this meaning, the paternal uncle is called one's <b>`Sinw</b>' of his father. <br /> <br />There is an authentic <b>Hadith</b> that states that the Messenger of Allah said to Umar bin Al-Khattab, <br /> <br />أَمَا شَعَرْتَ أَنَّ عَمَّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيه <br /> <br />Do you not know that man's paternal uncle is the <b>Sinw</b> of his father! <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />يُسْقَى بِمَاء <br /> <br />وَاحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ <br /> <br />بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِي الاُكُلِ <br /> <br />watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet commented on Allah's statement, <br />وَنُفَضِّلُ<b> <br />بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِي الاُكُلِ <br /></b> (yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat), <br /> <br />الدَّقَلُ وَالْفَارِسِيُّ وَالْحُلْوُ وَالْحَامِض <br /> <br />The <b>Dagal</b>, the Persian, the sweet, the bitter...&#34; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi collected this <b>Hadith</b> and said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, there are differences between plants and fruits with regards to shape, color, taste, scent, blossoms and the shape of their leaves. There are plants that are very sweet or sour, bitter or mild, fresh; some plants have a combination of these attributes, and the taste then changes and becomes another taste, by Allah's will. There is also some that are yellow in color, or red, or white, or black, or blue, and the same can be said about their flowers; and all these variances and complex diversities are watered by the same water. <br /> <br />Surely, in this there are signs for those who have sound reasoning, and surely, all this indicates the existence of the Creator Who does what He wills and Whose power made distinctions between various things and created them as He wills. So Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, in these things there are <b>Ayat</b> for the people who understand</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 3" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الرعد<span class="num-ar">13</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Ra'd<span> 13</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 5" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
