But to Allah they have attributed partners. Say, &#34;Name them. Or do you inform Him of that which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent of speech?&#34; Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way.

Or in apparent words?' Nay; but decked out fair to the unbelievers is their devising, and they are barred from the way; and whomsoever God leads astray, no guide has he.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>Is He who stands over every soul marking its action [in need of any partner]? Yet they ascribe partners to God. Say, ‘Name them,’ or, ‘Can you tell Him about something on the earth He does not know to exist, or is this just a display of words?’ But the things they devise are made alluring to the disbelievers and they are barred from the [right] path: no one can guide those God leaves to stray.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Is He, then, who is ever standing over every soul with that which he earneth, like unto other! And yet they have set up associates unto Allah. Say thou: name them; would ye inform Him of that which He knoweth not on the earth? or is it by way of outward saying? Aye! fair-seeming unto those who disbelieve is made their plotting, and they have been hindered from the way. And whomsoever sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say&#59; &#34;But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?&#34; Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Is it, then, in regard to Him Who watches over the deeds of every person that they are acting blasphemously by setting up His associates? Tell them: &#34;Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)! Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?&#34; Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words? Indeed, their foul contriving has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers and they have been barred from finding the Right Way. Whomsoever Allah lets go astray will have none to guide him.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Who is it who stands (watch) over every soul for what it does? Yet they ascribe compeers to God. Say: &#34;Then name them. Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth? Or is it only empty talk? In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path. Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>So is He who keeps a watch over the deeds of every soul (equal to their appointed partners)?

Yet they ascribe partners to Allah! Say, ‘Name them!’ Will you inform Him concerning something He does not know about on the earth, or concerning [what are] mere words? Indeed, to the faithless, their scheming is presented as decorous, and they have been barred from the [right] way; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no guide.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Is He Who watches over every soul and whatever it earns (to be denied or disobeyed)?

Or are you just uttering mere words (with neither meaning nor reference to anything existent and real)?

Say, `(Would) you name their attributes; and would you inform Him of something important which is on the earth but unknown to Him, or are these merely empty (and false) words?´ Nay, the fact of the matter is that their designing and their activities are made fair-seeming to the disbelievers (by satan), and they have been barred from the (right) path.

Rather their cheatery/deceit was decorated/beautified to those who disbelieved, and they prevented/obstructed from the way/path , and whom God misguides so (there is) none from (a) guide (is) for him.</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>So is He who keeps a watch over the deeds of every soul (equal to their appointed partners)?

Or are you informing Him of something on earth He does not know, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the scheming of those who disbelieve is made to appear good to them, and they are averted from the path. Whomever God misguides has no guide.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Is He Who stands, watches, over every soul what it has earned?, what it has done of good or evil -- and this is God -- like the idols who are not so? No! This [response] is suggested by [the following words]&#59; Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say&#59; `Name them!, for Him&#59; who are they? Or will you inform Him, will you inform God, of something, that is, of an associate, which He does not know in the earth? (an interrogative of disavowal); in other words, He has no associate, for if He did, He would know him -- exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it -- nay -- you call them associates, merely [a manner of] speaking?', that is, [it is merely] on the basis of false conjecture, without any truth in it. Nay, but their scheming, their unbelief, has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way, [from] the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray, for him there is no guide.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>There is no Similarity between Allah and False Deities in any Respect</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَأيِمٌ عَلَى كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ <br /> <br />Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge of every person and knows all that he has earned, <br /> <br />Allah is the guard and watcher over every living soul and knows what everyone does, whether good or evil, and nothing ever escapes His perfect observation. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلَا تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ <br /> <br />Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but we are witness thereof, when you are doing it. (10&#59;61) <br /> <br />and Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا <br /> <br />Not a leaf falls, but He knows it. (6&#59;59) <br /> <br />وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> <br />And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposits. All is in a Clear Book. (11&#59;6) <br /> <br />سَوَاءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ <br /> <br />It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. (13&#59;10) <br /> <br />يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى <br /> <br />He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden. (20&#59;7) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَهُوَ مَعَكُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do. (57&#59;4) <br /> <br />Is He Who is like this similar to the idols, that the polytheists worship, which can neither hear nor see nor do they have a mind nor able to bring good to themselves or to their worshippers nor prevent harm from themselves or their worshippers The answer to the question in the <b>Ayah</b> was omitted, because it is implied, for Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلُواْ لِلّهِ شُرَكَاء <br /> <br />Yet, they ascribe partners to Allah. <br /> <br />which they worshipped besides Him, such as idols, rivals and false deities, <br /> <br />قُلْ سَمُّوهُمْ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Name them!&#34; <br /> <br />make them known to us and uncover them so that they are known, for surely, they do not exist at all! <br /> <br />So Allah said, <br /> <br />أَمْ تُنَبِّيُونَهُ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth! <br /> <br />for had that thing existed in or on the earth, Allah would have known about it because nothing ever escapes His knowledge, <br /> <br />أَم بِظَاهِرٍ مِّنَ الْقَوْلِ <br /> <br />or is it (just) a show of words, <br /> <br />or doubts expressed in words, according to Mujahid, while Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said, false words. <br /> <br />Allah says, you (polytheists) worshipped the idols because you thought that they had power to bring benefit or harm, and this is why you called them gods, <br /> <br />إِنْ هِىَ إِلاَّ أَسْمَأءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَأ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَأوُكُم مَّأ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَـنٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الاٌّنفُسُ وَلَقَدْ جَأءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَى <br /> <br />They are but names which you have named - you and your fathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord! (53&#59;23) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />بَلْ زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مَكْرُهُمْ <br /> <br />Nay! To those who disbelieved, their plotting is made fair seeming, (or their words, according to Mujahid). <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> refers to the misguidance of the polytheists and their propagation night and day. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَأءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم <br /> <br />And We have assigned for them (devils) intimate companions, who have made fair-seeming to them. (41&#59;25) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَصُدُّواْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ <br /> <br />and they have been hindered from the right path; <br /> <br />Some read with <b>Fatha</b> over the <b>Sad</b> (i.e. <b>wa Saddu</b>), which would <br /> <br />mean, `and they hindered from the right path, feeling fond of the misguidance they are in, thinking that it is correct, they called to it and thus hindered the people from following the path of the Messengers.' <br /> <br />Others read it with <b>Damma</b> over the <b>Sad</b> (i.e. <b>wa Suddu</b>), which would mean, <br /> <br />`and they have been hindered from the right path,' explained it this way&#59;because they thought that their way looked fair or correct, they were hindered by it from the right path, <br /> <br />so Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide. <br /> <br />Allah said in similar instances, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُرِدِ اللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْياً <br /> <br />And whomsoever Allah wants to suffer a trial, you can do nothing for him against Allah. (5&#59;41) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَى هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ <br /> <br />If you covet for their guidance, then verily, Allah guides not those whom He makes to go astray. And they will have no helpers.
