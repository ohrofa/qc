Then have those who believed not accepted that had Allah willed, He would have guided the people, all of them?

Did not the believers know that, if God had willed, He would have guided men all together? And still the unbelievers are smitten by a shattering for what they wrought, or it alights nigh their habitation, until God's promise comes; and God will not fail the tryst.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>If there were ever to be a Quran with which mountains could be moved, the earth shattered, or the dead made to speak [it would have been this one], but everything is truly in God’s hands. Do the believers not realize that if God had so willed, He could have guided all mankind? As for the disbelievers, because of their misdeeds, disaster will not cease to afflict them or fall close to their homes until God’s promise is fulfilled: God never fails to keep His promise.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And if there were a Qur'an whereby the mountains could be moved or Whereby the earth could be traversed or whereby the dead could be spoken to, it would be in vain. Aye! the affair belongeth to Allah entirely. Have not then those who believe yet known that had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind! And a rattling adversity ceaseth not to befall those who disbelieve for that which they have wrought or to alight nigh unto their habitation. until Allah's promise cometh; verily Allah faileth not the tryst.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>And what would have happened were a Qur'an to be revealed wherewith mountains could be set in motion, or the earth cleft, or the dead made to speak? (To show such signs is not at all difficult for) everything rests entirely with Allah. So, do not the people of faith (still look forward to such a sign in response to the demand of the unbelievers and) despair as a result of knowing that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all to the Truth. Misfortune continues to afflict the unbelievers on account of their misdeeds, or to befall on locations close to their habitation. This will continue until Allah's promise (of chastisement) is fulfilled. Indeed Allah does not go back upon His promise.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Had there been a Qur'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God. Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind? As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass. Surely God does not go back on His promise.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And were such a Qur’an to come that would cause the mountains to move, or the earth to split asunder, or the dead to speak, even then these disbelievers would not believe; in fact, all matters are only at Allah’s discretion; so have not the Muslims despaired in that, had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind? Disasters shall continue to strike the disbelievers on account of their deeds, or descend near their homes until Allah’s promise comes; indeed Allah does not break the promise.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>If only it were a Quran whereby the mountains could be moved, or the earth could be toured, or the dead could be spoken to.... Indeed, all dispensation belongs to Allah. Have not the faithful yet realised that had Allah wished He would have guided mankind all together? The faithless will continue to be visited by catastrophes because of their doings—or they will land near their habitations—until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Indeed Allah does not break His promise.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>If at all through a discourse (qur’an) mountains were moved, or the earth were torn apart, or the dead were made to speak, (all would be only through this Qur’an so that the unbelievers would be compelled, having no choice but, to believe). No, but to God belongs the whole command (to decide what shall be and how it shall be). Do not yet those who believe accept that, if God had so willed, He would indeed have guided all humankind (to faith)? Those who disbelieve will not cease to be struck by severe blows for what they have been contriving, or these will alight close to their homes (to afflict them), until God’s promise (of the final victory of Islam or Judgment Day) is fulfilled. Surely God does not fail to keep the promise.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Had there been a Qur´ân whereby mountains could be moved, or whereby the earth could be torn asunder, or whereby the dead could be made to speak (it is this very Qur´ân indeed). Behold! the commandment and all power belongs to Allâh. Have not those who believe realized yet that if Allâh had (enforced) His will He would have indeed guided all mankind. And as for those who disbelieve, one calamity or the other will continue to befall them owing to their (evil) activities till you come to alight in their neighborhood, until the promise of Allâh (about the conquest of Makkah) comes to pass. Verily, Allâh will not fail (this) promise (of His).</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>And if that a Koran the mountains were made to move/walk with it?

That (E) if God willed/wanted, He would have guided the people all together . And those who disbelieved disaster still/continues (to) strike them because (of) what they made/did , or (it) takes place/descends near/close from their home/country until God`s promise comes, that God does not break the appointment (promise).</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>And were such a Qur’an to come that would cause the mountains to move, or the earth to split asunder, or the dead to speak, even then these disbelievers would not believe; in fact, all matters are only at Allah’s discretion; so have not the Muslims despaired in that, had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind?

Nay, but the affair belongs entirely to God, and none other, so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes, and no other; even if they were given what they request [of signs]. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested [of signs] should be manifested, hoping that they [the ones requesting them] might believe&#59; Have they not realised, those who believe, that (an is softened, in other words [understand it as] annahu) had God willed, He could have guided all mankind?, to faith, without [the need for] any sign? And the disbelievers, from among the people of Mecca, continue to be struck by devastation, a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship, such as being killed, taken captive, and [suffering] war or drought, because of what they wrought, because of their actions, that is, their disbelief; or you alight, O Muhammad (s), together with your army, near their home -- Mecca -- until God's promise, of victory against them, comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise&#59; and indeed, he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Virtues of the Qur'an and the Denial of Disbelievers</b> <br /> <br />Allah praises the Qur'an which He has revealed to Muhammad, peace be upon him, and prefers it to all other divinely revealed Books before it, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْانًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الَارْضُ <br /> <br />أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَى <br /> <br />And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved (from their places), or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak (it would not have been other than this Qur'an). <br /> <br />Allah says, `If there were a Book among the previous Divine Books with which the mountains could be moved from their places, or the earth could be cleaved asunder, or the dead speak in their graves, it would have been this Qur'an and none else.' <br /> <br />Or, this Qur'an is more worthy to cause all this, because of its marvelous eloquence that defies the ability of mankind and the Jinns, even if all of them gather their forces together to invent something like it or even a <b>Surah</b> like it. <br /> <br />Yet, these idolators disbelieve in the Qur'an and reject it. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />بَل لِّلّهِ الَامْرُ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah. <br /> <br />The decision over all affairs is with Allah Alone, whatever He wills, occurs and whatever He does not will, never occurs. <br /> <br />Certainly, he whom Allah misguides, will never find enlightenment and he whom Allah guides, will never be misled. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;He will only do what He wills and He decided that He will not do that.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq reported a chain for this, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari agreed with it. <br /> <br />We should state here that it is possible to call other Divine Books, Qur'an', since this Qur'an is based on all of them. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />خُفِّفَتْ عَلَى دَاوُدَ الْقِرَاءَةُ فَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ بِدَابَّتِهِ أَنْ تُسْرَجَ فَكَانَ يَقْرَأُ الْقُرْانَ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تُسْرَجَ دَابَّتُهُ وَكَانَ لَا يَأْكُلُ إِلاَّ مِنْ عَمَلِ يَدَيْه <br /> <br />Reciting was made easy for (Prophet) Dawud (David) in that he used to order that his animal be prepared for him to ride and in the meantime he would read the entire Qur'an. He used to eat only from what his hand made. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />The Qur'an mentioned here is refers to the <b>Zabur</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />أَفَلَمْ يَيْأَسِ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ <br /> <br />Have not then those who believed yet known, <br /> <br />that not all people would believe and understand and that, <br /> <br />أَن لَّوْ يَشَاء اللّهُ لَهَدَى النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind, <br /> <br />Surely, there is not a miracle or evidence more eloquent or effective on the heart and mind than this Qur'an. Had Allah revealed it to a mountain, you would see the mountain shake and humbled from fear of Allah. <br /> <br />The <b>Sahih</b> recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلاَّ وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مَا امَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Every Prophet was given (a miracle) the type of which would make (some) people believe. What I was given, however, is a revelation from Allah to me, and I hope that I will have the most following among them (Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> indicates that every Prophet's miracle disappeared upon his death, but this Qur'an will remain as evidence for all times. Verily, the miracle of the Qur'an will never end, nor will it become old the more it is read, nor will scholars ever have enough of it. <br /> <br />The Qur'an is serious and is not meant for jest; any tyrant that abandons it, Allah will destroy him; he who seeks guidance in other than the Qur'an, then Allah will misguide him. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَزَالُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ <br /> <br />أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ <br /> <br />And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it settles close to their homes, <br /> <br />because of their denial, disasters will still strike them in this life or strike those all around them, as a lesson and example for them. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرَى وَصَرَّفْنَا الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ <br /> <br />And indeed We have destroyed towns round about you, and We have shown (them) the <b>Ayat</b> in various ways that they might return (to the truth). (46&#59;27) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />أَفَلَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِى الاٌّرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَأ أَفَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ <br /> <br />See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders! Is it then they who will overcome! (21&#59;44) <br /> <br />Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ <br /></b> (or it settles close to their homes), <br /> <br />&#34;It is in reference to the disaster.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the apparent meaning here. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported that bin Abbas said about, <br /> <br />تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ <br /> (And a <b>Qari`ah</b> (disaster) strikes them because of their (evil) deeds), <br /> <br />&#34;A torment that descends on them from heaven, <br /><b> <br />أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيبًا مِّن دَارِهِمْ <br /></b> (or it settles close to their homes), <br /> <br />when the Messenger of Allah camps near their area and fights them.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said in another narration he reported from Ibn Abbas that, <br /> <br />قَارِعَةٌ <br /> (<b>Qari'ah</b>), means affliction. <br /> <br />These scholars also said that, <br /> <br />حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ وَعْدُ اللّهِ <br /> <br />until the promise of Allah comes to pass. <br /> <br />refers to the conquering of Makkah. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that; <br /> <br />it refers to the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly, Allah breaks not His promise. <br /> <br />to His Messengers to aid them and their followers in this life and the Hereafter, <br /> <br />فَلَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ <br /> <br />So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.
