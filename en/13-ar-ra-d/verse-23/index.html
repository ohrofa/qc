He will also elevate the grade of those who are lower, to the grades of those who are higher, a favor from Him out of His kindness, without decreasing the grade of those who are higher up (in Paradise). <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ <br /> <br />And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith&#59;to them shall We join their offspring. (52&#59;21) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَالمَلَيِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِم مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying)&#59;&#34;<b>Salamun</b> <b>`Alaykum</b> (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!&#34; <br /> <br />The angels will enter on them from every direction congratulating them for entering Paradise. The angels will welcome them with the Islamic greeting and commend them for earning Allah's closeness and rewards, as well as, being admitted into the Dwelling of Peace, neighbors to the honorable Messengers, the Prophets and the truthful believers. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-`As, may Allah be pleased with them both, narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />هَلْ تَدْرُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللهِ <br /> <br />Do you know who among Allah's creation will enter Paradise first? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Allah and His Messenger have more knowledge.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَوَّلُ مَنْ يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللهِ الْفُقَرَاءُ الْمُهَاجِرُونَ الَّذِينَ تُسَدُّ بِهِمُ الثُّغُورُ وَتُتَّقَى بِهِمُ الْمَكَارِهُ <br /> <br />The first among Allah's creation to enter Paradise are the poor emigrants (in Allah's cause) with whom the outposts (of the land) are secured and the various afflictions are warded off. <br /> <br />وَيَمُوتُ أَحَدُهُمْ وَحَاجَتُهُ فِي صَدْرِهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ لَهَا قَضَاءً فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ مَلَيِكَتِهِ ايْتُوهُمْ فَحَيُّوهُمْ <br /> <br />One of them would die while his need is still in his chest, because he was unable to satisfy it himself. Allah will say to whom He will among His angels, &#34;Go to them and welcome them with the <b>Salam</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />فَتَقُولُ الْمَلَيِكَةُ نَحْنُ سُكَّانُ سَمَايِكَ وَخِيرَتُكَ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ أَفَتَأْمُرُنَا أَنْ نَأْتِي هوُلَاءِ وَنُسَلِّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />The angels will say, &#34;We are the residence of Your heaven and the best of Your creation, do You command us to go to them and welcome them with the <b>Salam</b>!&#34; <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا عِبَادًا يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْيًا وَتُسَدُّ بِهِمُ الثُّغُورُ وَتُتَّقَى بِهِمُ الْمَكَارِهُ وَيَمُوتُ أَحَدُهُمْ وَحَاجَتُهُ فِي صَدْرِهِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ لَهَا قَضَاءً <br /> <br />Allah will say, &#34;They are My servants who worshipped Me and did not associate anyone or anything with Me in worship. With them, the outposts were secured and the afflictions were warded off. One of them would die while his need is in his chest, unable to satisfy it.&#34; <br /> <br />قَالَ فَتَأْتِيهِمُ الْمَلَايِكَةُ عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ فَيَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ كُلِّ بَاب <br /> <br />So the angels will go to them from every gate (of Paradise), saying, <br /> <br />سَلَمٌ عَلَيْكُم بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 22" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الرعد<span class="num-ar">13</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Ra'd<span> 13</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 24" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
