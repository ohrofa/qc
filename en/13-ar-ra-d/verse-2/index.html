He, by His leave, order and power, has elevated the heavens high above the earth, distant and far away from reach. The heaven nearest to the present world encompasses the earth from all directions, and is also high above it from every direction. <br /> <br />The distance between the first heaven and the earth is five hundred years from every direction, and its thickness is also five hundred years. <br /> <br />The second heaven surrounds the first heaven from every direction, encompassing everything that the latter carries, with a thickness also of five hundred years and a distance between them of five hundred years. The same is also true about the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh heavens. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ <br /> <br />It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof. (65&#59;12) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا <br /> <br />..without any pillars that you can see. <br /> <br />meaning, `there are pillars, but you cannot see them,' <br /> <br />according to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and several other scholars. <br /> <br />Iyas bin Mu`awiyah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The heaven is like a dome over the earth,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, without pillars. <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Qatadah, and this meaning is better for this part of the <b>Ayah</b>, especially since Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَأءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ <br /> <br />He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His permission. (22&#59;65) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah's statement, <br />تَرَوْنَهَا <br /> (...that you can see), affirms that there are no pillars. Rather, the heaven is elevated (above the earth) without pillars, as you see. <br /> <br />This meaning best affirms Allah's ability and power. <br /><b>Al-Istawa', Rising above the Throne</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ <br /> <br />Then, He rose above (<b>Istawa</b>) the Throne. <br /> <br />We explained the meaning of the <b>Istawa'</b> in Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b> (7&#59;54), and stated that it should be accepted as it is without altering, equating, annulling its meaning, or attempts to explain its true nature. Allah is glorified and praised from all that they attribute to Him. <br /><b>Allah subjected the Sun and the Moon to rotate continuously</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ <br /> <br />كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لَاجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى <br /> <br />He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running (its course) for a term appointed. <br /> <br />It was said that the sun and the moon continue their course until they cease doing so upon the commencement of the Final Hour, as Allah stated, <br /> <br />وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا <br /> <br />And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). (36&#59;38) <br /> <br />It was also said that the meaning is&#59; <br /> <br />until they settle under the Throne of Allah after passing the other side of the earth. So when they, and the rest of the planetary bodies reach there, they are at the furthest distance from the Throne. Because according to the correct view, which the texts prove, it is shaped like a dome, under which is all of the creation. It is not circular like the celestial bodies, because it has pillars by which it is carried. This fact is clear to those who correctly understand the <b>Ayat</b> and authentic <b>Hadiths</b>. All the (praise is due to) Allah and all the favors are from Him. <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the sun and the moon here because they are among the brightest seven heavenly objects. Therefore, if Allah subjected these to His power, then it is clear that He has also subjected all other heavenly objects. <br /> <br />يُدَبِّرُ الَامْرَ <br /> <br />He manages and regulates all affairs; <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />لَا تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ <br /> <br />Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him. (41&#59;37) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />And (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists! (7&#59;54) <br /> <br />Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />يُفَصِّلُ الايَاتِ لَعَلَّكُم بِلِقَاء رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He explains the <b>Ayat</b> in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the Meeting with your Lord. <br /> <br />means, He explains the signs and clear evidences that testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him.
