Truly your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite their evil-doing, for otherwise He would not have left a single creature on the face of it [the earth]; and truly your Lord is severe in retribution, against those who disobey Him.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Disbelievers ask for the Punishment to be delivered now!</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ <br /> <br />They ask you to hasten, <br /> <br />in reference to the disbelievers, <br /> <br />بِالسَّيِّيَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ <br /> <br />the evil before the good, <br /> <br />meaning, the punishment. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b> that they said, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ يأَيُّهَا الَّذِى نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ <br /> <br />لَّوْ مَا تَأْتِينَا بِالْمَلَـيِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ <br /> <br />مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـيِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُواْ إِذًا مُّنظَرِينَ <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;O you to whom the <b>Dhikr</b> (the Qur'an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful!&#34; <br /> <br />We send not the angels down except with the truth (i.e. for torment), and in that case, they (the disbelieves) would have no respite! (15&#59;6-8) <br /> <br />and two <b>Ayat</b>; <br /> <br />وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />And they ask you to hasten on the torment! (29&#59;53-54) <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />سَأَلَ سَأيِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ <br /> <br />A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall. (70&#59;1) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا الَّذِينَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا الْحَقُّ <br /> <br />Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth. (42&#59;18) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا <br /> <br />They say&#59;&#34;Our Lord! Hasten to us <b>Qittana</b>. (38&#59;16), <br /> <br />meaning, our due torment and reckoning. <br /> <br />Allah said that they also supplicated, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ <br /> <br />And (remember) when they said&#59;&#34;O Allah! If this (the Qur'an) is indeed the truth from You. (8&#59;32) <br /> <br />They were such rebellious, stubborn disbelievers that they asked the Messenger to bring them Allah's torment. <br /> <br />Allah replied, <br /> <br />وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ الْمَثُلَتُ <br /> <br />while exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. <br /> <br />Meaning, `We have exerted Our punishment on the previous disbelieving nations, and made them a lesson and example for those who might take heed from their destruction.' <br /> <br />If it was not for His forbearance and forgiveness, Allah would have indeed punished them sooner. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ يُوَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَابَّةٍ <br /> <br />And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the surface of the earth. (35&#59;45) <br /> <br />Allah said in this honorable <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ <br /> <br />But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. <br /> <br />He is full of forgiveness, pardoning and covering the mistakes of people, in spite of their wrongdoing and the errors committed night and day. <br /> <br />Allah next reminds that His punishment is severe, so that fear and hope are both addressed and mentioned. <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَسِعَةٍ وَلَا يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ الْقَوْمِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br />If they belie you, say&#59;&#34;Your Lord is the Owner of vast mercy, and never will His wrath be turned back from the people who are criminals.&#34; (6&#59;147) <br /> <br />إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br />Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (7&#59;167) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />نَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ الْعَذَابُ الاٌّلِيمُ <br /> <br />Declare unto My servants that truly I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment. (15&#59;49-50) <br /> <br />There are many other <b>Ayat</b> that mention both fear and hope</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 5" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الرعد<span class="num-ar">13</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Ra'd<span> 13</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 7" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
