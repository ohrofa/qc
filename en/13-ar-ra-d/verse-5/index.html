Yet, they admit that Allah originated the creation of all things and brought them into existence after they were nothing. <br /> <br />However, they deny Allah's claim that He will resurrect the world anew, even though they admit to what is more amazing than what they deny and reject. <br /> <br />فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ <br /> <br />then wondrous is their saying&#59; <br /> <br />Therefore, it is amazing that they said, <br /> <br />أَيِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَيِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ <br /> <br />When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation, <br /> <br />It is an obvious fact to every sane and knowledgeable person that creating the heavens and earth is a greater feat than creating men, and that He Who has originated creation is more able to resurrect it anew, <br /> <br />أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَعْىَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بَلَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br />Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead! Yes, He surely is able to do all things. (46&#59;33) <br /> <br />Allah described those who deny Resurrection, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ <br /> <br />وَأُوْلَيِكَ الَاغْلَلُ فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ <br /> <br />They are those who disbelieved in their Lord!
