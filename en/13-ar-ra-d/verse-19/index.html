They believe that none of its parts contradicts the others, that all its information is true and that all its commandments and prohibitions are just, <br /> <br />وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً <br /> <br />And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. (6&#59;15) <br /> <br />كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى <br /> <br />be like him who is blind! <br /> <br />It is accurate in its information and stories and just in what it orders. Therefore, the <b>Ayah</b> says, those who believe in the truth that you brought, O Muhammad, are not at all similar to those who are blind and cannot find guidance to what benefits them, which they cannot even comprehend. And even if they comprehend the guidance, they will not follow it, believe in it or abide by it.' <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />لَا يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَأيِزُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful. (59&#59;20) <br /> <br />Allah said in this honorable <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَا <br /> <br />أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ <br /> <br />مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى <br /> <br />Shall he then who knows that what has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind! <br /> <br />They are not equal. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ الَالْبَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed. <br /> <br />meaning, it is those who have sound minds who draw lessons, gain wisdom and understand. <br /> <br />We ask Allah to make us among them</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 18" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الرعد<span class="num-ar">13</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Ra'd<span> 13</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 20" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
