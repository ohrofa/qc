Yet, they take as lords others besides Allah and worship them, even though these false gods do not have the power to benefit or harm themselves, or those who worship them. <br /> <br />Therefore, the polytheists will not benefit or have harm removed from them by these false deities. <br /> <br />Are those who worship the false deities instead of Allah equal to those who worship Him alone, without partners, and thus have a light from their Lord. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br /> <br />قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الَاعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ <br /> <br />أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِي الظُّلُمَاتُ وَالنُّورُ <br /> <br />أَمْ جَعَلُواْ لِلّهِ شُرَكَاء خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />Say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Is the blind equal to the one who sees! <br /> <br />Or darkness equal to light! <br /> <br />Or do they assign to Allah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creations seemed alike to them!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah asks, `Do these polytheists worship gods besides Him that rival Him in what He created! <br /> <br />Have their false deities created similar creations to those Allah created and, thus, they are confused between the two types of creations, not knowing which was created by others besides Allah!' <br /> <br />Rather, the <b>Ayah</b> proves that the truth is nothing like this. There is none similar to Allah, nor does He have an equal, a rival, anyone like Him, a minister, a son, or a wife. Allah is glorified in that He is far away from all that is ascribed to Him. <br /> <br />These idolators worship gods that they themselves admit were created by Allah and are subservient to Him. They used to say during their <b>Talbiyah</b>&#59;&#34;Here we rush to Your obedience. There is no partner for You, except Your partner, You own him and he owns not.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah also mentioned their polytheistic statements in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَأ إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَى <br /> <br />We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah. (39&#59;3) <br /> <br />Allah admonished them for this false creed, stating that only those whom He chooses are allowed to intercede with Him, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ <br /> <br />Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. (34&#59;23) <br /> <br />وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ <br /> <br />And there are many angels in the heavens.....(53&#59;26) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ اتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً <br /> <br />لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً <br /> <br />وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً <br /> <br />There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection. (19&#59;93-95) <br /> <br />If all are Allah's servants, then why do any of them worships each other without proof or evidence that allows them to do so Rather, they rely on sheer opinion and innovation in the religion, even though Allah has sent all of His Prophets and Messengers, from beginning to end, prohibiting this practice (polytheism) and ordering them to refrain from worshipping others besides Allah. They defied their Messengers and rebelled against them, and this is why the word of punishment struck them as a worthy recompense, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا <br /> <br />And your Lord treats no one with injustice.
