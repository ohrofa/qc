But as for him who believes and works righteousness, he shall have the best reward (<b>Al-Husna</b>), and we shall speak unto him mild words by our command. (18&#59;87-88) <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ <br /> <br />For those who have done good is the best (<b>Al-Husna</b>) and even more. (10&#59;26) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ لَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُ <br /> <br />But those who answered not His call, <br /> <br />disobeyed Allah, <br /> <br />لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُم مَّا فِي الَارْضِ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />if they had all that is in the earth together, (meaning, in the Hereafter). <br /> <br />وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لَافْتَدَوْاْ بِهِ <br />with its like, they would offer it in order to save themselves. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> says&#59; <br /> <br />Had the earth's fill of gold and its like with it, they would try to ransom themselves from Allah's torment at that time. However, this will not be accepted from them. Verily, Allah the Exalted will not accept any type of exchange from, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ لَهُمْ سُوءُ الْحِسَابِ <br /> <br />For them there will be the terrible reckoning. <br /> <br />in the Hereafter, when they will be reckoned for the <b>Naqir</b> and the <b>Qitmir</b>, the big and the small. Verily, he who is reckoned in detail on that Day will receive punishment, hence Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ <br /> <br />وَبِيْسَ الْمِهَادُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Their dwelling place will be Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 17" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الرعد<span class="num-ar">13</span> :<span class="num-ar">18</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Ra'd<span> 13</span>:<span>18</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Ra&#39;d Verse 19" href="/en/13-ar-ra-d/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
