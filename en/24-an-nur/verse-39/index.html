[A mirage is] a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat, resembling running water -- which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, like what he had supposed. Likewise is [the case of] the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds, such as some voluntary alms, will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed, in other words, it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God there, namely, in the place of his deeds, Who pays him his account in full, that is, He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Two Examples of two kinds of Disbelievers</b> <br /> <br />These are two examples which Allah sets forth of two kinds of disbelievers. <br /> <br />Similarly He sets forth two parables of the hypocrites at the beginning of Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />one involving fire and the other involving water. <br /> <br />Similarly, in Surah <b>Ar-Ra`d</b> He gives two parables of the guidance and knowledge that are instilled in the heart, again involving fire and water; <br /> <br />we have discussed each of them in the appropriate place and there is no need to repeat it here, praise be to Allah. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْأنُ مَاء حَتَّى إِذَا جَاءهُ <br /> <br />As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a <b>Qi`ah</b>. The thirsty one thinks it to be water until he comes up to it, <br /> <br />The first of these two examples is that of the disbelievers who call others to their disbelief, thinking that they have good actions and beliefs, when this is not in fact the case. Their likeness is that of a mirage which is seen in a desert plain, looking from a distance as if it is a deep sea. <br /> <br />The word <b>Qi`ah</b> refers to a vast, flat, level area of land in which the mirage may appear. <br /> <br />There are different kinds of mirage, one which appears after midday, and another which appears in the morning and looks like water between heaven and earth. If a person who is in need of water sees the mirage, he thinks that it is water so he heads towards it in order to drink from it, but when he reaches it, <br /> <br />لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />he finds it to be nothing. <br /> <br />Similarly the disbeliever thinks that he is doing something good and that he has achieved something, but when Allah judges him on the Day of Resurrection, and brings him to account and examines his deeds, he will find that nothing has been accepted at all, either because of a lack of sincere belief or because he did not follow the proper ways of the <b>Shariah</b>. As Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَدِمْنَأ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَأءً مَّنثُوراً <br /> <br />And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust. (25&#59;23) <br /> <br />And He says here&#59; <br /> <br />وَوَجَدَ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ فَوَفَّاهُ حِسَابَهُ وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but he finds Allah with him, who will pay him his due. And Allah is swift in taking account. <br /> <br />A similar view was also narrated from Ubayy bin Ka`b, Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is reported that on the Day of Resurrection it will be said to the Jews, <br /> <br />&#34;What did you used to worship!&#34; <br /> <br />They will say, &#34;We used to worship <b>`Uzayr</b> the son of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />It will be said to them, &#34;You have lied. Allah has not begotten a son. What do you want!&#34; <br /> <br />They will say, &#34;O Lord, we are thirsty, give us something to drink.&#34; <br /> <br />It will be said to them, &#34;Do you not see!&#34; <br /> <br />Then Hell will be shown to them as if it is a mirage, parts of it consuming other parts, and they will go and fall into it. <br /> <br />This is the parable of one whose ignorance is deep and advanced. <br /> <br />As for those whose ignorance is simple, those who are uneducated and foolish and blindly follow the leaders of disbelief, knowing and understanding nothing, their parable is as Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 38" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-38/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">39</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>39</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 40" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-40/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=24,sura_dir="an-nur",count_ayat=64,number_aya=39;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
