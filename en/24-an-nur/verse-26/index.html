Good statements are for good people and good people for good statements&#59; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Evil words are for evil men, and evil men are for evil words; good words are for good men and good men are for good words. This was revealed concerning A'ishah and the people of the slander.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also narrated from Mujahid, Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan bin Abu Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Habib bin Abi Thabit and Ad-Dahhak, and it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />He interpreted it to mean that evil speech is more suited to evil people, and good speech is more suited to good people. What the hypocrites attributed to A'ishah was more suited to them, and she was most suited to innocence and having nothing to do with them. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ مُبَرَّوُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ <br /> <br />such (good people) are innocent of (every) bad statement which they say; <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, <br /> <br />&#34;Evil women are for evil men and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women.&#34; <br /> <br />This also necessarily refers back to what they said, i.e., Allah would not have made A'ishah the wife of His Messenger unless she had been good, because he is the best of the best of mankind. If she had been evil, she would not have been a suitable partner either according to His Laws or His decree. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ مُبَرَّوُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />such are innocent of (every) bad statement which they say; <br /> <br />meaning, they are remote from what the people of slander and enmity say. <br /> <br />لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ <br /> <br />for them is forgiveness, <br /> <br />means, because of the lies that were told about them, <br /> <br />وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and honored provision. <br /> <br />meaning, with Allah in the Gardens of Delight. <br /> <br />This implies a promise that she will be the wife of the Messenger of Allah in Paradise</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 25" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">26</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>26</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 27" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
