Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />This is another matter of etiquette to which Allah has guided His believing servants. Just as He commanded them to seek permission when entering, He also commanded them to seek permission when leaving, especially when they are doing something together with the Messenger, such as the Friday, <b>`Id</b>, or congregational prayers, or a meeting for the purpose of consultation and so on. <br /> <br />Allah commanded them not to leave him in these situations until they had asked his permission. If they did this, then they were of the true believers. Then Allah commanded His Messenger to give permission when someone asked for it, if he wanted to. <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَن لِّمَن شِيْتَ مِنْهُمْ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمُ اللَّهَ <br /> <br /> <br />give permission to whom you will of them, and ask Allah for their forgiveness. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud reported that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا انْتَهَى أَحَدُكُمْ إِلَى الْمَجْلِسِ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ فَإِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَقُومَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ فَلَيْسَتِ الاُْولَى بِأَحَقَّ مِنَ الاْخِرَةِ <br /> <br />When any of you joins a gathering, let him say <b>Salam</b>, and when he wants to leave, let him say <b>Salam</b>. The former is not more important than the latter. <br /> <br />This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said&#59;&#34;It is a <b>Hasan Hadith</b>.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 61" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">62</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>62</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 63" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-63/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
