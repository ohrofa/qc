before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. There is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for they continually circulate among you - some of you, among others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="ahmedali"><h3>Ahmed Ali</h3><p>O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid-day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you. There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission). God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3>Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>O People who Believe! The slaves you possess and those among you who have not attained adulthood, must seek your permission on three occasions; before the dawn prayer, and when you remove your garments in the afternoon, and after the night prayer; these three times are of privacy for you; other than these three times, it is no sin for you or for them; moving about around you and among each other; and this is how Allah explains the verses for you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3>Ali Ünal</h3><p>O you who believe!

These are your three times of privacy. Beyond these occasions, there is no blame on you nor on them if they come in without permission – they are bound to move about you, some of you attending on others. Thus God makes clear for you (the instructions in) the Revelations. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>O you who believe! it is binding on those whom your right hands possess (domestic servants) and those (of your children) who have not reached the age of puberty to ask your permission (before coming into your private rooms) in three instances, before the morning Prayer, and when you lay aside your clothes due to the heat (in summer) at noon and after the night Prayer. These are three times when your privacy should be respected. At other times no blame shall lie on you or on them (if they come to you without permission), for they have to move about (waiting upon you) some of you (attending) upon others (according to need).

[These are] three periods of privacy for you (read thalthu [`awrtin lakum] with nominative inflection as the predicate of an implied subject followed by a genitive annexation, with the annexed term standing in place thereof [of the predicate], in other words [the implied predicate followed by the annexation is] hiya awqt, `these are times of ...'; or read thaltha [`awrtin lakum] in the accusative, the implication being that awqta is itself in the accusative as a substitute for the [syntactical] status of what precedes it, in place of which stands the annexed term). It is because clothes are taken off that private parts are revealed during such [periods]. Neither you nor they, namely, slaves and young boys, would be at fault, in entering upon you without asking leave, at other times, that is, after the three times of day [specified]; they frequent you, to provide service, [as] some of you [do] with others (this sentence corroborates the preceding one). So, just as He has clarified what has been mentioned, God clarifies for you the signs, the rulings; and God is Knower, of the affairs of His creatures, Wise, in what He has ordained for them. It is said that the `permission' verse (yat al-isti'idhn) was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not [abrogated], but that people thought little of neglecting to seek permission [in such situations].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Times when Servants and Young Children should seek Permission to enter</b> <br /> <br />Allah commands the believers&#59; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا لِيَسْتَأْذِنكُمُ الَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ لَمْ يَبْلُغُوا الْحُلُمَ مِنكُمْ ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ مِن قَبْلِ صَلَاةِ الْفَجْرِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission on three occasions&#59; <br /> <br />before the <b>Fajr</b> prayer, <br /> <br />These <b>Ayat</b> include a discussion of how people who are closely related should seek permission to enter upon one another. <br /> <br />What was mentioned earlier in the <b>Surah</b> had to do with how unrelated people should seek permission to enter upon one another. <br /> <br />Allah commanded the believers to ensure that their servants and their children who have not yet reached puberty should seek permission at three times&#59; <br /> <br />the first is before the <b>Fajr</b> prayer, because people are asleep in their beds at that time. <br /> <br />وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَابَكُم مِّنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ <br /> <br />and while you put off your clothes during the afternoon, <br /> <br />means, at the time of rest, because a man may be in a state of undress with his wife at that time. <br /> <br />وَمِن بَعْدِ صَلَةِ الْعِشَاء <br /> <br />and after the <b>`Isha'</b> prayer. <br /> <br />because this is the time for sleep. <br /> <br />Servants and children are commanded not to enter upon household members at these times, because it is feared that a man may be in an intimate situation with his wife and so on. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ثَلَثُ عَوْرَاتٍ لَّكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَا عَلَيْهِمْ جُنَاحٌ بَعْدَهُنَّ <br /> <br />(These) three (times) are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them, <br /> <br />If they enter at a time other than these, there is no sin on you if you let them enter, and no sin on them if they see something at a time other than these times. <br /> <br />They have been given permission to enter suddenly, because they are those who go around in the house, i.e., to serve you etc., and as such they may be forgiven for things that others will not be forgiven. <br /> <br />Although this <b>Ayah</b> is quite clear and has not been abrogated, people hardly follow it, and Abdullah bin Abbas denounced the people for that. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Most of the people do not follow it, the <b>Ayah</b> that speaks about asking permission, but I tell my servant woman to seek permission to enter.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud said&#59; <br /> <br />Ata' also narrated that Ibn Abbas commanded this. <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri narrated that Musa bin Abi A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked Ash-Sha`bi (about the <b>Ayah</b>)&#59; <br /> لِيَسْتَأْذِنكُمُ الَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ <br /> (Let your slaves and slave-girls ask your permission). <br /> <br />He said, `It has not been abrogated.' <br /> <br />I said&#59;`But the people do not do that.' <br /> <br />He said, `May Allah help them.&#34;' <br /> <br />طَوَّافُونَ عَلَيْكُم بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />to move about, attending to each other. <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الاْيَاتِ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat to you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <br /> <br />Then Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 57" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">58</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>58</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 59" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
