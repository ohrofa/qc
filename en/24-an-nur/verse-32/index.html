Whoever cannot do that, then let him fast, for it is a protection for him. <br /> <br />This was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> from the <b>Hadith</b> of Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />In the <b>Sunan</b>, it was recorded from more than one person that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />تَزَوَّجُوا تَوَالَدُوا تَنَاسَلُوا فَإِنِّي مُبَاهٍ بِكُمُ الاُْمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /> <br /> <br />Marry and have children, for I will be proud of you before the nations on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />The word <b>Al-Ayama</b>, the plural form of <b>Ayyim</b>, is used to describe a woman who has no husband and a man who has no wife, regardless of whether they have been married and then separated, or have never been married at all. Al-Jawhari reported this from the scholars of the (Arabic) language, and the word is applied to men and women alike. <br /> <br />وَالصَّالِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ وَإِمَايِكُمْ <br /> <br />and the pious of your servants and maidservants. <br /> <br />إِن يَكُونُوا فُقَرَاء يُغْنِهِمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> <br />If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Allah encouraged them to get married, commanded both free men and servants to get married, and He promised to enrich them.&#34; <br /> <br />It was recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Seek the richness through marriage, for Allah says&#59; <br />وَالصَّالِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ وَإِمَايِكُمْ <br /> (If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty).&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />Al-Baghawi also recorded something similar from Umar. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Sufficient, All-Knowing. <br /> <br />It was reported from Al-Layth from Muhammad bin Ajlan from Sa`id Al-Maqburi from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />ثَلَثَةٌ حَقٌّ عَلَى اللهِ عَوْنُهُمْ <br /> <br />النَّاكِحُ يُرِيدُ الْعَفَافَ <br /> <br />وَالْمُكَاتَبُ يُرِيدُ الاْاَدَاءَ <br /> <br />وَالْغَازِي فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ <br /> <br />There are three whom it is a right upon Allah to help&#59; <br /> <br />one who gets married seeking chastity; <br /> <br />a slave who makes a contract with his master with the aim of buying his freedom; and <br /> <br />one who fights for the sake of Allah. <br /> <br />This was recorded by Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />The Prophet performed the marriage of a man who owned nothing but his waist wrap, and could not even buy a ring made of iron, but he still married him to that woman, making the <b>Mahr</b> his promise to teach her whatever he knew of the Qur'an. <br /> <br />And it is known from the generosity and kindness of Allah that He provided him with whatever was sufficient for her and for him. <br /><b>The Command to keep Oneself Chaste if One is not able to get Married</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 31" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">32</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>32</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 33" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=24,sura_dir="an-nur",count_ayat=64,number_aya=32;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
