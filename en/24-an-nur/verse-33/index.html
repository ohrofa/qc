Whoever cannot do that, then let him fast, for it is a protection for him. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is general in meaning, and the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b> is more specific, where Allah says&#59; <br /><b> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ <br /></b> (And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women) until His statement; <b> <br />وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ <br /></b> (but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint. <br /> <br />meaning, it is better for you to be patient and refrain from marrying slave-girl, because any child that is born will also be a slave. <br /><b> <br />وَاللّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /></b> (and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).

So he went to Umar (bin Al-Khattab), may Allah be pleased with him, and he said, `Write it for him.' <br /> <br />He refused, so Umar hit him with his whip and recited, <br />فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا <br /> (give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them). <br /> <br />Then he wrote the contract.&#34; <br /> <br />This was mentioned by Al-Bukhari with a disconnected chain of narration. <br /> <br />It was also narrated by Abdur-Razzaq who said Ibn Jurayj told them&#59; <br /> <br />I said to Ata', &#34;If I know that my servant has some money, is it obligatory for me to write him a contract of emancipation.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, `I do not think it can be anything but obligatory.&#34;' <br /> <br />It was also said by Amr bin Dinar who said, <br /> <br />&#34;I said to `Ata', `Are you narrating this from anybody?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Sirin wanted Anas bin Malik to write a contract of emancipation and he delayed, then Umar said to him, <br /> <br />&#34;You should certainly write him a contract of emancipation.&#34; <br />Its chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>. <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا <br /> <br />if you find that there is good and honesty in them. <br /> <br />Some of them said (this means) trustworthiness. <br /> <br />Some said&#59;&#34;Honesty,&#34; <br /> <br />and others said&#59;&#34;A skill and ability to earn.&#34; <br /> <br />وَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي اتَاكُمْ <br /> <br />And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. <br /> <br />This is the share of the wealth of <b>Zakah</b> that Allah stated to be their right. <br /> <br />This is the opinion of Al-Hasan, Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and his father and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />It was also the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />وَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي اتَاكُمْ <br /> <br />And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. <br /> <br />Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is urging the people, their masters and others.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Al-Aslami and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Allah commanded the believers to help in freeing slaves.&#34; <br /><b>The Prohibition of forcing One's Slave-Girls to commit Zina</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> <br />And force not your slave-girls to prostitution... <br /> <br />Among the people of the <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, there were some who, if he had a slave-girl, he would send her out to commit <b>Zina</b> and would charge money for that, which he would take from her every time. <br /> <br />When Islam came, Allah forbade the believers to do that. The reason why this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, according to the reports of a number of earlier and later scholars of <b>Tafsir</b>, had to do with Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. He had slave-girls whom he used to force into prostitution so that he could take their earnings and because he wanted them to have children which would enhance his status, or so he claimed. <br /><b>Reports narrated on this Topic</b> <br /> <br />In his <b>Musnad</b>, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Amr bin Abd Al-Khaliq Al-Bazzar, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Az-Zuhri said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul had a slave-girl whose name was Mu`adhah, whom he forced into prostitution. When Islam came, the <b>Ayah</b> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> (And force not your slave-girls to prostitution...) was revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Sufyan that Jabir said concerning this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;This was revealed about a slave-girl belonging to Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul whose name was Musaykah. He used to force her to commit immoral actions, but there was nothing wrong with her and she refused. Then Allah revealed this Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> (And force not your slave-girls to prostitution), until His saying; <br />وَمَن يُكْرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> (But if anyone compels them, then after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).&#34; <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i also recorded something similar. <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard -- and Allah knows best -- that this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about two men who used to force two slave-girls of theirs (into prostitution). One of them was called Musaykah who belonged to (the Ansari), and Umaymah the mother of Musaykah belonged to Abdullah bin Ubayy. <br /> <br />Mu`adhah and Arwa were in the same situation. Then Musaykah and her mother came to the Prophet and told him about that.
