Whoever cannot do that, then let him fast, for it is a protection for him. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is general in meaning, and the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b> is more specific, where Allah says&#59; <br /><b> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ <br /></b> (And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women) until His statement; <b> <br />وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ <br /></b> (but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint. <br /> <br />meaning, it is better for you to be patient and refrain from marrying slave-girl, because any child that is born will also be a slave. <br /><b> <br />وَاللّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /></b> (and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful). (4&#59;25) <br /> <br />وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ الَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحًا <br /> <br /> <br />And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, <br /> <br />Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This refers to a man who sees a woman and it is as if he feels desire; if he has a wife then let him go to her and fulfill his desire with her, and if he does not have a wife, then let him ponder the kingdom of heaven and earth until Allah grants him means of livelihood.&#34; <br /><b>The Command to grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ الْكِتَابَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا <br /> <br />And such of your servants as seek a writing (of emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them. <br /> <br />This is a command from Allah to slave-owners&#59;if their servants ask them for a contract of emancipation, they should write it for them, provided that the servant has some skill and means of earning so that he can pay his master the money that is stipulated in the contract. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said&#59;&#34;Rawh narrated from Ibn Jurayj&#59; <br /> <br />`I said to Ata', &#34;If I know that my servant has money, is it obligatory for me to write him a contract of emancipation.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I do not think it can be anything but obligatory.&#34; <br /> <br />Amr bin Dinar said&#59;&#34;I said to Ata', `Are you narrating this from anybody?' <br /> <br />He said, `No,' then he told me that Musa bin Anas told him that Sirin, who had a lot of money, asked Anas for a contract of emancipation and he refused. So he went to Umar (bin Al-Khattab), may Allah be pleased with him, and he said, `Write it for him.' <br /> <br />He refused, so Umar hit him with his whip and recited, <br />فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا <br /> (give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them). <br /> <br />Then he wrote the contract.&#34; <br /> <br />This was mentioned by Al-Bukhari with a disconnected chain of narration. <br /> <br />It was also narrated by Abdur-Razzaq who said Ibn Jurayj told them&#59; <br /> <br />I said to Ata', &#34;If I know that my servant has some money, is it obligatory for me to write him a contract of emancipation.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, `I do not think it can be anything but obligatory.&#34;' <br /> <br />It was also said by Amr bin Dinar who said, <br /> <br />&#34;I said to `Ata', `Are you narrating this from anybody?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Sirin wanted Anas bin Malik to write a contract of emancipation and he delayed, then Umar said to him, <br /> <br />&#34;You should certainly write him a contract of emancipation.&#34; <br />Its chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>. <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا <br /> <br />if you find that there is good and honesty in them. <br /> <br />Some of them said (this means) trustworthiness. <br /> <br />Some said&#59;&#34;Honesty,&#34; <br /> <br />and others said&#59;&#34;A skill and ability to earn.&#34; <br /> <br />وَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي اتَاكُمْ <br /> <br />And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. <br /> <br />This is the share of the wealth of <b>Zakah</b> that Allah stated to be their right. <br /> <br />This is the opinion of Al-Hasan, Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and his father and Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />It was also the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />وَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي اتَاكُمْ <br /> <br />And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. <br /> <br />Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is urging the people, their masters and others.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Al-Aslami and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Allah commanded the believers to help in freeing slaves.&#34; <br /><b>The Prohibition of forcing One's Slave-Girls to commit Zina</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> <br />And force not your slave-girls to prostitution... <br /> <br />Among the people of the <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, there were some who, if he had a slave-girl, he would send her out to commit <b>Zina</b> and would charge money for that, which he would take from her every time. <br /> <br />When Islam came, Allah forbade the believers to do that. The reason why this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, according to the reports of a number of earlier and later scholars of <b>Tafsir</b>, had to do with Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. He had slave-girls whom he used to force into prostitution so that he could take their earnings and because he wanted them to have children which would enhance his status, or so he claimed. <br /><b>Reports narrated on this Topic</b> <br /> <br />In his <b>Musnad</b>, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Amr bin Abd Al-Khaliq Al-Bazzar, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Az-Zuhri said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul had a slave-girl whose name was Mu`adhah, whom he forced into prostitution. When Islam came, the <b>Ayah</b> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> (And force not your slave-girls to prostitution...) was revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Sufyan that Jabir said concerning this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;This was revealed about a slave-girl belonging to Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul whose name was Musaykah. He used to force her to commit immoral actions, but there was nothing wrong with her and she refused. Then Allah revealed this Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> (And force not your slave-girls to prostitution), until His saying; <br />وَمَن يُكْرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> (But if anyone compels them, then after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).&#34; <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i also recorded something similar. <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard -- and Allah knows best -- that this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about two men who used to force two slave-girls of theirs (into prostitution). One of them was called Musaykah who belonged to (the Ansari), and Umaymah the mother of Musaykah belonged to Abdullah bin Ubayy. <br /> <br />Mu`adhah and Arwa were in the same situation. Then Musaykah and her mother came to the Prophet and told him about that. Then Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاء <br /> (And force not your slave-girls to prostitution), meaning <b>Zina</b>. <br /> <br />إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّنًا <br /> <br />if they desire chastity, <br /> <br />means, if they want to be chaste, which is the case with the majority of slave-girls. <br /> <br />لِّتَبْتَغُوا عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />in order that you may make a gain in the goods of this worldly life. <br /> <br />meaning, from the money they earn and their children. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah forbade the money earned by&#59; <br /> <br />the cupper, <br /> <br />the prostitute and <br /> <br />the fortune-teller. <br /> <br />According to another report&#59; <br /> <br />مَهْرُ الْبَغِيِّ خَبِيثٌ <br /> <br />وَكَسْبُ الْحَجَّامِ خَبِيثٌ <br /> <br />وَثَمَنُ الْكَلْبِ خَبِيثٌ <br /> <br />The earnings of a prostitute are evil, <br /> <br />the earnings of a cupper are evil, and <br /> <br />the price of a dog is evil. <br /> <br />وَمَن يُكْرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if anyone compels them, then after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <br /> <br />meaning, towards them, as has already been stated in the <b>Hadith</b> narrated from Jabir. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;If you do that, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful, and their sin will be on the one who forced them to do that.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Mujahid, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Al-A`mash and Qatadah. <br /> <br />After explaining these rulings in detail, Allah says</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>And let those who cannot find the means to marry be continent, [those who do not have] the bridal money or the means for financial support needed for marriage, [let them restrain themselves] from fornication, until God enriches them, [until] He improves their means, out of His bounty, and they marry. And those who seek a written contract [of emancipation], from among those whom your right hand owns, of male slaves and female slaves, contract with them accordingly, if you know in them any good, such as trustworthiness and the ability to earn [income] in order to fulfil the amount stated in the written contract, which might be worded for example thus&#59; `I contract you for [the amount of] two thousand to be paid over a period of two months, at one thousand a month, and if you fulfill this, you are a free man', and the other would say, `I accept'; and give them -- this is a command for the [slaves'] owners -- out of the wealth of God which He has given you, in the measure that will help them to fulfill their commitment to you (the action of t', `giving', here suggests that some of the amount to which they have committed themselves should be waived). And do not compel your slave-girls, your handmaidens, to prostitution, fornication, when they desire to be chaste, to abstain therefrom (this `desire' is the cause of the [act of] `compulsion', so that the statement is not properly a conditional), that you may seek, through such compulsion, the transient things of the life of this world -- this was revealed regarding `Abd Allh b. Ubayy, who used to force his slave-girls to earn money through fornication. And should anyone compel them, then surely God, after their compulsion, will be Forgiving, to these [slave-girls], Merciful, to them.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum), give them such a deed if ye know any good in them&#59; yea, give them something yourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them, yet, after such compulsion, is Allah, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to them),</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 32" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> النور <span class="num-ar">24</span> : <span class="num-ar">33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur <span>24</span>:<span>33</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 34" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
