Would you do that, O Umm Ayub!' <br /> <br />She said, `No, by Allah, I would not do that.' <br /> <br />He said, `And by Allah, A'ishah is better than you.' <br /> <br />When the Qur'an was revealed, Allah mentioned those who spoke about the evil deed among the people of the slander, <b> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَاوُوا بِالاِْفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنكُمْ <br /></b> (Verily, those who brought forth the slander are a group among you). (24&#59;11) <br /> <br />This refers to Hassan and his companions who said what they said. <br /> <br />Then Allah said, <br /> <br />لَوْلَا إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ ظَنَّ الْمُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />Why then, did not the believers, men, when you heard it, think... <br /> <br />means, as Abu Ayub and his wife did.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />ظَنَّ الْمُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />the believers, men think... <br /> <br />meaning, `why did they not think good, because the Mother of the believers is his wife and is closer to him.' <br /> <br />This is concerned with innermost feelings; <br /> <br />وَقَالُوا <br /> <br />and say&#59; <br /> <br />means, with their tongues, verbally, <br /> <br />هَذَا إِفْكٌ مُّبِينٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;This (charge) is an obvious lie.&#34; <br /> <br />means, a clear untruth told about the Mother of the believers, may Allah be pleased with her. <br /> <br />What happened should not have been the cause of suspicion. The fact that the Mother of the believers came openly, riding on the camel of Safwan bin Al-Mu`attal at midday, with the entire army watching and the Messenger of Allah among them, should have made it clear that there was no cause for suspicion. If there had been anything suspicious about the matter, they would not have come openly in this manner in front of so many witnesses; they would have come secretly. On this basis, what the people of the slander said accusing the Mother of the believers was an utter lie, false speech and evil foolish talk, by which people who indulged in it lost out. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 11" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 13" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
