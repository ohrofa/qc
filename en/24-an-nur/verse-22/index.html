He was one of those who had migrated for the sake of Allah. He had invented the lies and the slander, but then Allah accepted his repentance from that and the prescribed punishment was carried out on him. <br /> <br />As-Siddiq was known for his generosity and he did favors to his relatives and strangers alike. When this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />Do you not love that Allah should forgive you, <br /> <br />which shows that the reward fits the action, and that `if you forgive others, you will be forgiven,' then As-Siddiq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Of course, by Allah, we love -- O our Lord -- that You should forgive us.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he resumed his spending on Mistah and said, &#34;By Allah I will never stop spending on him.&#34; <br /> <br />This was to counteract what he had said previously, &#34;By Allah I will never spend on him.&#34; <br /> <br />This proves that he deserved to be called As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him and his daughter. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 21" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">22</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>22</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 23" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
