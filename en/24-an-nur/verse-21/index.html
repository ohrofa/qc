And were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy not one of you, O band [of accusers], would ever have grown pure, after the calumny of which you spoke, that is to say, [not one of you] would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will, from sin, by accepting his repentance from him, and God is Hearer, of what you have said, Knower, of your intentions.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>يَاأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا لَاا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Follow not the <b>Khutuwat</b> of <b>Shaytan</b>. <br /> <br />meaning, his ways and paths and what he commands, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاء وَالْمُنكَرِ <br /> <br />And whosoever follows the footsteps of <b>Shaytan</b>, then, verily, he commands immorality and the evil deeds. <br /> <br />This is a warning given in the most concise and eloquent manner. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn Abbas that <br />خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ <br /> (the <b>Khutuwat</b> of <b>Shaytan</b>), <br /> <br />means his deeds. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said that&#59; <br /> <br />it means his evil whispers. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Every sin is one of the footsteps of <b>Shaytan</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Mijlaz said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Vowing to commit sin is one of the footsteps of <b>Shaytan</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا <br /> <br />And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. <br /> <br />meaning, if He did not help whomever He wills to repent and come back to Him and be purified from <b>Shirk</b>, evil and sin, and whatever bad characteristics each person has according to his nature, no one would ever attain purity and goodness. <br /> <br />وَلَكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />But Allah purifies whom He wills, <br /> <br />means, among His creation, and He sends astray whomever He wills, leaving him to be doomed in his misguidance and sin. <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ <br /> <br />and Allah is All-Hearer, <br /> <br />means, He hears what His servants say, <br /> <br />عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Knower. <br /> <br />of who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be misguided</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 20" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>21</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 22" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=24,sura_dir="an-nur",count_ayat=64,number_aya=21;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
