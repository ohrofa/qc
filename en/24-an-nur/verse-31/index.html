The second [of these] is that [even] this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these [parts] will cause temptation -- and this is the preferred opinion, if one must settle this topic [with a definitive opinion]; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms, that is, let them cover up their heads, necks and chests with veils, and not reveal their, hidden, adornment, namely, all that is other than the face and the hands, except to their husbands (bu`l is the plural form of ba`l, `male spouse') or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, all of whom are permitted to look thereat, except for the part from the navel down to the knees, which is unlawful for any other than their husbands to see; `their women', however, excludes disbelieving women, for it is not permitted for Muslim women to reveal themselves to these; `what their right hands own' comprises slaves; or such men who are dependant, on what food may be left over, not (ghayri, read as an adjective, or read ghayra as an exceptive) possessing any sexual desire, [not] those men who are in [sexual] need of women, so for example those whose male member cannot become erect; or children who are not yet aware of women's private parts, in [the context of] sexual intercourse, and so to these they may reveal themselves except for that part from the navel to the knees. And do not let them thump with their feet to make known their hidden ornaments, as in a rattling anklet [and the like]. And rally to God in repentance, O believers, [repenting] of the occasions on which you may have looked at what is forbidden [to look at] of such [parts] and otherwise, so that you might be prosperous, [so that you might] be saved from such [sinful acts] when your repentance thereof is accepted -- in this verse the prevalent address is to males over females.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Rulings of Hijab</b> <br /> <br />This is a command from Allah to the believing women, and jealousy on His part over the wives of His believing servants. It is also to distinguish the believing women from the women of the <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and the deeds of the pagan women. <br /> <br />The reason for the revelation of this <b>Ayah</b> was mentioned by Muqatil bin Hayyan, when he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;We heard -- and Allah knows best -- that Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari narrated that Asma' bint Murshidah was in a house of hers in Bani Harithah, and the women started coming in to her without lower garments so that the anklets on their feet could be seen, along with their chests and forelocks. Asma' said&#59;`How ugly this is!' Then Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />وَقُل لِّلْمُوْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ <br /></b> (And tell the believing women to lower their gaze...).&#34; <br /> <br />And Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَقُل لِّلْمُوْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ <br /> <br />And tell the believing women to lower their gaze, <br /> <br />meaning, from that which Allah has forbidden them to look at, apart from their husbands. <br /> <br />(Some) scholars said that it is permissible for women to look at non-<b>Mahram</b> men without desire, as it was recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that the Messenger of Allah was watching the Ethiopians playing with spears in the <b>Masjid</b> on the day of <b>`Id</b>, and A'ishah the Mother of the believers was watching them from behind him and he was concealing her from them, until she got bored and went away. <br /> <br />وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ <br /> <br />and protect their private parts. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;From immoral actions.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Every <b>Ayah</b> of the Qur'an in which protecting the private parts is mentioned means protecting them from <b>Zina</b>, except for this <b>Ayah</b> -- <br />وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ <br /> (and protect their private parts), which means protecting them from being seen by anybody.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا <br /> <br />and not to show off their adornment except that which is apparent, <br /> <br />means, they should not show anything of their adornment to non-<b>Mahram</b> men except for whatever it is impossible to hide. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Such as clothes and outer garments,&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning what the Arab women used to wear of the veil which covered their clothes and whatever showed from underneath the outer garment. There is no blame on her for this, because this is something that she cannot conceal. Similar to that is what appears of her lower garment and what she cannot conceal. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Abu Al-Jawza', Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and others also had the same view as Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ <br /> <br />and to draw their veils all over their <b>Juyub</b>, <br /> <br />means that they should wear the outer garment in such a way as to cover their chests and ribs, so that they will be different from the women of the <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, who did not do that but would pass in front of men with their chests completely uncovered, and with their necks, forelocks, hair and earrings uncovered. So Allah commanded the believing women to cover themselves, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لاَِّزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاء الْمُوْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ذَلِكَ أَدْنَى أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُوْذَيْنَ <br /> <br />O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies. That will be better, that they should be known, so as not to be annoyed. (33&#59;59) <br /> <br />And in this noble <b>Ayah</b> He said&#59; <br />وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ <br /> (and to draw their (<b>Khumur</b>) veils all over their <b>Juyub</b>. <br /><b>Khumur</b> (veils) is the plural of <b>Khimar</b>, which means something that covers, and is what is used to cover the head. This is what is known among the people as a veil. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ <br />(and to draw), means to pull it around and tie it securely. <br /> <br />بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ <br /> (their veils all over their <b>Juyub</b>), means, over their necks and chests so that nothing can be seen of them. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;May Allah have mercy on the women of the early emigrants, when Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ <br /> (and to draw their veils all over their <b>Juyub</b>), they tore their aprons and <b>Akhtamar</b> themselves with them.&#34; <br /> <br />He also narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, used to say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ <br /> (and to draw their veils all over their <b>Juyub</b>) was revealed, they took their <b>Izars</b> (waist sheets) and tore them at the edges, and <b>Akhtamar</b> themselves with them.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ابَايِهِنَّ أَوْ ابَاء بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَايِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَاء بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِي إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِي أَخَوَاتِهِنَّ <br /> <br />and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers, or their sons, or their husband's sons, or their brothers or their brother's sons, or their sister's sons, <br /> <br />All of these are a woman's close relatives whom she can never marry (<b>Mahram</b>) and it is permissible for her to show her adornments to them, but without making a wanton display of herself. <br /> <br />Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded that Ikrimah commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ابَايِهِنَّ أَوْ ابَاء بُعُولَتِهِنَّ <br /> (and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers...), <br /> <br />&#34;The paternal uncle and maternal uncle are not mentioned here, because they may describe a woman to their sons, so a woman should not remove her <b>Khimar</b> in front of her paternal or maternal uncle.&#34; <br /> <br />With regard to the husband, all of this is for his sake, so she should try her best when adorning herself for him, unlike the way she should appear in front of others. <br /> <br />أَوْ نِسَايِهِنَّ <br /> <br />or their women, <br /> <br />this means that she may also wear her adornment in front of other Muslim women, but not in front of the women of <b>Ahl Adh-Dhimmah</b> (Jewish and Christian women), lest they describe her to their husbands. <br /> <br />This is prohibited for all women, but more so in the case of the women of <b>Ahl Adh-Dhimmah</b>, because there is nothing to prevent them from doing that, but Muslim women know that it is unlawful and so, would be deterred from doing it. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا تُبَاشِرِ الْمَرْأَةُ الْمَرْأَةَ فَتَنْعَتَهَا لِزَوْجِهَا كَأَنَّهُ يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهَا <br /> <br /> <br />No woman should describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he is looking at her. <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> from Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ <br /> <br />or their right hand possessions. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means from among the women of the idolators. It is permissible for a Muslim woman to reveal her adornment before such a woman, even if she is an idolatress, because she is her slave-girl.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib. <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />أَوِ التَّابِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِي الاِْرْبَةِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ <br /><b>Tabi`in</b> among men who do not have desire, <br /> <br />such as hired servants and followers who are not at the same level as the woman and are feeble-minded and have no interest in or desire for women. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is the kind of person who has no desire.&#34; <br /> <br />Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is the hermaphrodite, who does not experience erections.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of others among the <b>Salaf</b>. <br /> <br />It was narrated in the <b>Sahih</b> from A'ishah that a hermaphrodite, used to enter upon the family of the Messenger of Allah and they used to consider him as one of those who do not have desire, but then the Messenger of Allah came in when he was describing a woman with four rolls of fat in front and eight behind. The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَلَا أَرَى هَذَا يَعْلَمُ مَا هَهُنَا لَا يَدْخُلَنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />Lo! I think this person knows what is they are; he should never enter upon you. <br /> <br />He expelled him, and he stayed in Al-Bayda' and only came on Fridays to get food. <br /> <br />أَوِ الطِّفْلِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَى عَوْرَاتِ النِّسَاء <br /> <br />or children who are not aware of the nakedness of women. <br /> <br />Because they are so young they do not understand anything about women or their <b>`Awrah</b> or their soft speech or their enticing ways of walking and moving. <br /> <br />If a child is small and does not understand that, there is nothing wrong with him entering upon women, but if he is an adolescent or approaching adolescence, so that he knows and understands these things, and can make a distinction between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not enter upon women. <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِيَّاكُمْ وَالدُّخُولَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ <br /> <br />Avoid entering upon women. <br /> <br />It was said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the male in-laws!&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الْحَمْوُ الْمَوْتُ <br /> <br />The male in-law is death. <br /><b>The Etiquette of Women walking in the Street</b> <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِينَ مِن زِينَتِهِنَّ <br /> <br />And let them not stamp their feet... <br /> <br />During <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this. <br /> <br />By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِينَ مِن زِينَتِهِنَّ <br /> <br />And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. <br /> <br />From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. <br /> <br />Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />كُلُّ عَيْنٍ زَانِيَةٌ وَالْمَرْأَةُ إِذَا اسْتَعْطَرَتْ فَمَرَّتْ بِالْمَجْلِسِ فَهِيَ كَذَا وَكَذَا <br /> <br />Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such -- (meaning an adulteress). <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />&#34;And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is <b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah, as he was coming out of the <b>Masjid</b> and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women&#59; <br /> <br />اسْتَأْخِرْنَ فَإِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَكُنَّ أَنْ تَحْقُقْنَ الطَّرِيقَ عَلَيْكُنَّ بِحَافَّاتِ الطَّرِيقِ <br /> <br />Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road. <br /> <br />The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls. <br /> <br />وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَا الْمُوْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful. <br /> <br />means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids. <br /> <br />And Allah is the source of strength</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 30" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">31</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>31</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 32" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=24,sura_dir="an-nur",count_ayat=64,number_aya=31;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
