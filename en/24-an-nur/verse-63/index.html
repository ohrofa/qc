If one of them wanted to leave, he would make a gesture to the Prophet with his finger, and the Prophet would give permission without the man speaking. This is because if the Prophet was giving the <b>Khutbah</b> and a man spoke, it would invalidate his Friday prayer.&#34; As-Suddi said, &#34;If they were with him for a congregational prayer, they would hide behind one another so that he could not see them.&#34; <br /><b>The Prohibition of going against the Messenger's Commandment</b> <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ <br /> <br />And let those beware who oppose the Messenger's commandment, <br /> <br />This means going against the commandment of the Prophet, which is his way, methodology and <b>Sunnah</b>. All words and deeds will be measured against his words and deeds; those that are in accordance with his words and deeds will be accepted, and whatever does not match up will be rejected, no matter who the person is who said and did them. <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> and elsewhere that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلً لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ <br /> <br />Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected. <br /> <br />meaning, let those beware who go against the <b>Shariah</b> of the Messenger, in secret and in the open, <br /> <br />أَن تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ <br /> <br />lest some <b>Fitnah</b> should befall them, <br /> <br />i.e., lest some disbelief or hypocrisy or innovation enter their hearts. <br /> <br />أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />or a painful torment be inflicted on them. <br /> <br />means in this world afflicting them with capital punishment, or by law of prescribed punishment, or by confinement in prison, or so on. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهَا جَعَلَ الْفَرَاشُ وَهَذِهِ الدَّوَابُّ اللَّيِي يَقَعْنَ فِي النَّارِ يَقَعْنَ فِيهَا وَجَعَلَ يَحْجُزُهُنَّ وَيَغْلِبْنَهُ فَيَقْتَحِمْنَ فِيهَا قَالَ فَذَلِكَ مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ أَنَا اخِذٌ بِحُجَزِكُمْ عَنِ النَّارِ هَلُمَّ عَنِ النَّارِ فَتَغْلِبُونِي وَتَقْتَحِمُونَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />The parable of me and you is as the example of a man who kindled a fire and when it illuminated all around him, moths and other creatures started falling into the fire, and he was trying to stop them but they overwhelmed him and still kept falling in. This is the parable of me and you. I am trying to restrain you and keep you away from the fire, but you overwhelm me and fall in. <br /> <br />This was also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 62" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-62/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النور<span class="num-ar">24</span> :<span class="num-ar">63</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Nur<span> 24</span>:<span>63</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Nur Verse 64" href="/en/24-an-nur/verse-64/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
