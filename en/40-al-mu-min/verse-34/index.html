He was a Messenger who called his people to Allah with justice, but they did not obey him in matters of worshipping Allah, they only obeyed him in worldly matters that pertained to his position in the government. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَمَا زِلْتُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا جَاءكُم بِهِ حَتَّى إِذَا هَلَكَ قُلْتُمْ لَن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ رَسُولاً <br /> <br />but you ceased not to doubt in that which he brought to you, till when he died, you said&#59;&#34;No Messenger will Allah send after him.&#34; <br /> <br />means, `you despaired, and said by way of wishful thinking,' <br /> <br />لَن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ رَسُولاً <br /> <br />No Messenger will Allah send after him. <br /> <br />This was because of their disbelief and rejection (of the Messengers). <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ اللَّهُ مَنْ هُوَ مُسْرِفٌ مُّرْتَابٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thus Allah leaves astray him who is a transgressor and a skeptic. <br /> <br />means, this is the state of the one whom Allah sends astray because of his sinful actions and the doubts in his heart</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 33" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> غافر<span class="num-ar">40</span> :<span class="num-ar">34</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mu'min<span> 40</span>:<span>34</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ghafir,Al-Fadhl</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 35" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-35/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
