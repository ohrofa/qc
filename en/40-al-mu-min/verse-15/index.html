The angels and the <b>Ruh</b> (Jibril) ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years. (70&#59;3-4) <br /> <br />If Allah wills, we will discuss below which is the most correct view the distance between the Throne and the seventh earth according to a group of earlier and later scholars. More than one scholar said that the Throne is made of red rubies. The width between two corners of it is the distance of a fifty thousand year long journey and its height above the seventh earth is the distance of a fifty thousand years long journey. <br /> <br />يُلْقِي الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَاء مِنْ عِبَادِهِ <br /> <br />He sends the revelation of His command to any of His servants He wills, <br /> <br />This is like the Ayat&#59; <br /> <br />يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـيِكَةَ بِالْرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَأءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنْذِرُواْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَـهَ إِلَا أَنَاْ فَاتَّقُونِ <br /> <br />He sends down the angels with the <b>Ruh</b> (revelation) of His command to whom of His servants He wills (saying)&#59;&#34;Warn mankind that none has the right to be worshipped but I, so have <b>Taqwa</b> of Me.&#34; (16&#59;2) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ <br /> <br />عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ <br /> <br />And truly, this is a revelation from the Lord of all that exits, Which the trustworthy <b>Ruh</b> (Jibril) has brought down Upon your heart that you may be (one) of the warners.
