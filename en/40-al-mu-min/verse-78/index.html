When [the Day] God ordained comes, just judgement will be passed between them: there and then, those who followed falsehood will be lost.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Assuredly We have sent apostlesy before thee, of them are these whose store We have recounted Unto thee and these whose story We have net recounted Unto thee.

So when the commade of Allah cometh, judgment will be given with truth, and then will lose the followers of falsehood.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>We did aforetime send messengers before thee&#59; of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah&#59; but when the Command of Allah issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and there perished, there and then those who stood on Falsehoods.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Indeed We sent many Messengers before you: of them there are some whose account We have narrated to you and there are others whose account We have not narrated to you. It did not lie in any Messenger's power to bring any Sign except with Allah's leave. So when Allah's decree came, the matter was decided with justice, and those steeped in error courted utter loss, then and there.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>Surely We have sent apostles before you, some of whose account We have related to you, and that of some We have not told you.

Of them are those We have recounted to you, and of them are those We have not recounted to you. An apostle may not bring any sign except by Allah’s permission. Hence, when Allah’s edict comes, judgment is made with justice, and it is thence that the falsifiers become losers.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Indeed We sent Messengers before you; among them are those (the exemplary histories of) whom We have already related to you, and among them are those (the exemplary histories of) whom We have not related to you. It is not for a Messenger to bring forth a miracle except by God’s leave. Then, when God’s command is issued, it is judged with truth and justice, and those inventors of vain falsehoods (who associate partners with God and strive to disprove the truth) are brought to loss and ruin.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>And indeed We have already sent (Our) Messengers before you.

Of them are those whom We have recounted to you, and of them are those whom We have not recounted to you&#59; it is reported that God, exalted be He, sent 8,000 prophets, 4,000 prophets [sent] from among the Children of Israel and [the other] 4,000 from among the remainder of mankind. And it was never [permitted] for any messenger, from among them, to bring a sign except with God's permission, for they are [also] servants enthralled [by Him]. Hence when God's command comes, for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers, judgement, between the messengers and their deniers, is passed justly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood become losers, that is to say, [it is thence that] the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind, although such [advocates of falsehood] will have always been losers always before that.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلً مِّن قَبْلِكَ مِنْهُم مَّن قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you, of some of them We have related to you their story. <br /> <br />as Allah also says in Surah <b>An-Nisa</b>', meaning, `We have revealed the stories of some of them and how their people disbelieved in them, but the Messengers ultimately prevailed.' <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّن لَّمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ <br /> <br />And of some We have not related to you their story, <br /> <br />and they are many, many more than those whose stories have been told, as has been stated in Surah <b>An-Nisa</b>'. <br /> <br />Praise and blessings be to Allah. <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِأيَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />and it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a sign except by the leave of Allah. <br /> <br />means, none of the Prophets was able to bring miracles to his people except when Allah granted him permission to do that as a sign of the truth of the message he brought to them. <br /> <br />فَإِذَا جَاء أَمْرُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />But, when comes the commandment of Allah, <br /> <br />means, His punishment and vengeance which will encompass the disbelievers, <br /> <br />قُضِيَ بِالْحَقِّ <br /> <br />the matter will be decided with truth, <br /> <br />so the believers will be saved and the disbelievers will be destroyed. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and the followers of falsehood will then be lost.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 77" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> غافر<span class="num-ar">40</span> :<span class="num-ar">78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mu'min<span> 40</span>:<span>78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ghafir,Al-Fadhl</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 79" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
