Surely You are the One Who is the Mighty, the Wise, in what He does.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدتَّهُم وَمَن صَلَحَ مِنْ ابَايِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ <br /> <br />Our Lord! And make them enter the `Adn (Eternal) Gardens which you have promised them -- and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! <br /> <br />meaning, `bring them together so that they may find delight in one another in neighboring dwellings.' <br /> <br />This is like the Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَأ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ <br /> <br />And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything. (52&#59;21) <br /> <br />This means, `that all of them will be made equal in status. In this way they may delight in one another's company; the one who is in the higher status will not lose anything. On the contrary We will raise the one whose deeds are of a lower status so that they will become equal, as a favor and a blessing from Us.' <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said that; <br /> <br />when the believer enters Paradise, he will ask where his father, son and brother are. It will be said to him, `they did not reach the same level of good deeds as you did'. <br /> <br />He will say, `but I did it for my sake and for theirs.' <br /> <br />Then they will be brought to join him in that higher degree. <br /> <br />Then Sa`id bin Jubayr recited this Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدتَّهُم وَمَن صَلَحَ مِنْ ابَايِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ <br /> <br />إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br />Our Lord! And make them enter the `Adn (Eternal) Gardens which you have promised them -- and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise. <br /> <br />Mutarrif bin Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, <br /> <br />&#34;The most sincere of the servants of Allah towards the believers are the angels.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he recited this Ayah&#59; <br />رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدتَّهُم <br /> (Our Lord! And make them enter the `Adn (Eternal) Paradises which you have promised them...) <br /> <br />He then said, <br /> <br />&#34;The most treacherous of the servants of Allah towards the believers are the <b>Shayatin</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />You are the Almighty, the All-Wise. <br /> <br />means, `the One Whom none can resist or overwhelm; what You will happens and what You do not will does not happen; You are Wise in all that You say and do, in all that You legislate and decree.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 7" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> غافر<span class="num-ar">40</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Mu'min<span> 40</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Ghafir,Al-Fadhl</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Mu&#39;min Verse 9" href="/en/40-al-mu-min/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
