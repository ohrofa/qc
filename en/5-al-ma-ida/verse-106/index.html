When death approaches any of you, and you make a bequest, then take the testimony of two... <br /> <br />meaning that there should be two witnesses in such cases, <br /> <br />ذَوَا عَدْلٍ <br /> <br />just men... <br /> <br />thus, describing them as just, <br /> <br />مِّنكُمْ <br /> <br />of your own folk, (Muslims). <br /> <br />أَوْ اخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ <br /> <br />or two others from outside, <br /> <br />non-Muslims, meaning the People of the Book, according to Ibn Abbas as Ibn Abi Hatim recorded. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />if you are traveling through the land, (on a journey), <br /> <br />فَأَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ الْمَوْتِ <br /> <br />and the calamity of death befalls you. <br /> <br />These are two conditions that permit using non-Muslims from among the <b>Dhimmis</b> for witnesses when there are no Muslims present&#59; <br /> <br />When one is traveling and needs to write a will, as Sharih Al-Qadi said. Ibn Jarir recorded that Sharih said, <br /> <br />&#34;The witness of the Jews and Christians is not allowed except while traveling, and even then only to witness the dictation of the will.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِن بَعْدِ الصَّلَةِ <br /> <br />Detain them both after the <b>Salah</b> (the prayer), <br /> <br />According to Al-Awfi who reported it from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />refers to the <b>`Asr</b> prayer. <br /> <br />This is the same explanation reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Qatadah, Ikrimah and Muhammad bin Sirin. <br /> <br />As for Az-Zuhri, he said that; <br /> <br />they are detained after Muslim prayer (i.e., in congregation). <br /> <br />Therefore, these two witnesses will be detained after a congregational prayer, <br /> <br />فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِاللّهِ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ <br /> <br />let them both swear by Allah if you are in doubt. <br /> <br />meaning, if you are in doubt that they might have committed treachery or theft, then they should swear by Allah, <br /> <br />لَا نَشْتَرِي بِهِ <br /> <br />We wish not in this, <br /> <br />According to Muqatil bin Hayyan, <br /> <br />in our vows. <br /> <br />ثَمَنًا <br /> <br />for any worldly gain, <br /> <br />of this soon to end life. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى <br /> <br />even though he be our near relative. <br /> <br />meaning, if the beneficiary be our near relative, we will still not compromise on the truth. <br /> <br />وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَادَةَ اللّهِ <br /> <br />We shall not hide the testimony of Allah, <br /> <br />thus stating that the testimony is Allah's, as a way of respecting it and valuing its significance. <br /> <br />إِنَّا إِذًا لَّمِنَ الاثِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for then indeed we should be of the sinful.&#34;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 105" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-105/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">106</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>106</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 107" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-107/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=106;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
