Mischief in the land refers to various types of evil. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the <b>Ayat</b>, <br />إِنَّمَا جَزَاء الَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ اللّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ <br /> (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger) until, <br /> أَنَّ اللّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> (Allah is Of-Forgiving, Most Merciful), <br /> <br />&#34;Were revealed about the idolators. Therefore, the <b>Ayah</b> decrees that, whoever among them repents before you apprehend them, then you have no right to punish them. This <b>Ayah</b> does not save a Muslim from punishment if he kills, causes mischief in the land or wages war against Allah and His Messenger and then joins rank with the disbelievers, before the Muslims are able to catch him. He will still be liable for punishment for the crimes he committed.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded that Ikrimah said that Ibn Abbas said that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّمَا جَزَاء الَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ اللّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الَارْضِ فَسَادًا <br /> (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land...), <br /> <br />&#34;Was revealed concerning the idolators, those among them who repent before being apprehended, they will still be liable for punishment for the crimes they committed.&#34; <br /> <br />The correct opinion is that this <b>Ayah</b> is general in meaning and includes the idolators and all others who commit the types of crimes the <b>Ayah</b> mentioned. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Qilabah Abdullah bin Zayd Al-Jarmi, said that Anas bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;Eight people of the Ukl tribe came to the Messenger of Allah and gave him their pledge to follow Islam. Al-Madinah's climate did not suit them and they became sick and complained to Allah's Messenger. So he said, <br /> <br />أَلَا تَخْرُجُونَ مَعَ رَاعِينَا فِي إِبِلِهِ فَتُصِيبُوا مِنْ أَبْوَالِهَا وَأَلْبَانِهَا <br /> <br />Go with our shepherd to be treated by the milk and urine of his camels. <br /> <br />So they went as directed, and after they drank from the camels' milk and urine, they became healthy, and they killed the shepherd and drove away all the camels. The news reached the Prophet and he sent (men) in their pursuit and they were captured. He then ordered that their hands and feet be cut off (and it was done), and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. Next, they were put in the sun until they died.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording of Muslim. <br /> <br />In another narration for this <b>Hadith</b>, it was mentioned that these people were from the tribes of Ukl or Uraynah. <br /> <br />Another narration reported that these people were put in the Harrah area (of Al-Madinah), and when they asked for water, no water was given to them. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَن يُقَتَّلُواْ أَوْ يُصَلَّبُواْ أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم مِّنْ خِلفٍ أَوْ يُنفَوْاْ مِنَ الَارْضِ <br /> <br />they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn Abbas said about this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;He who takes up arms in Muslim land and spreads fear in the fairways and is captured, the Muslim Leader has the choice to either have him killed, crucified or cut off his hands and feet.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Mujahid, Ata, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ibrahim An-Nakhai and Ad-Dahhak, as Abu Jafar Ibn Jarir recorded. <br /> <br />This view is supported by the fact that the word <b>Aw</b> (or), indicates a choice. As Allah said, <br /> <br />فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنْكُمْ هَدْياً بَـلِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَـكِينَ أَو عَدْلُ ذلِكَ صِيَاماً <br /> <br />The penalty is an offering, brought to the <b>Ka`bah</b>, of an eatable animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting. (5&#59;95) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ <br /> <br />And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a ransom of either fasting or giving charity or offering a sacrifice. (2&#59;196) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَـكِينَ مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ <br />for its expiation feed ten of the poor, on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them, or free a slave. (5&#59;89) <br /> <br />All of these <b>Ayat</b> offer a choice, just as the Ayah above. <br /> <br />As for Allah's statement, <br />أَوْ يُنفَوْاْ مِنَ الَارْضِ <br /> (or be exiled from the land). <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Az-Zuhri, Al-Layth bin Sa`d and Malik bin Anas that, <br /> <br />it means, he is actively pursued until he is captured, and thus receives his prescribed punishment, or otherwise he escapes from the land of Islam. <br /> <br />Some said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> means these people are expelled to another land, or to another state by the Muslims authorities. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, Al-Hasan, Az-Zuhri, Ad-Dahhak and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br /> <br />he is expelled, but not outside of the land of Islam, while others said that he is to be imprisoned. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ لَهُمْ خِزْيٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِي الاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />means, the punishment We prescribed, killing these aggressors, crucifying them, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or expelling them from the land is a disgrace for them among mankind in this life, along with the tremendous torment Allah has prepared for them in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />This view supports the opinion that these <b>Ayat</b> were revealed about the idolators. As for Muslims, in his <b>Sahih</b>, Muslim recorded that Ubadah bin As-Samit said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah took the same pledge from us that he also took from women&#59;That we do not associate anything with Allah in worship, we do not steal, commit adultery, or kill our children, and that we do not spread falsehood about each other. <br /> <br />He said that he who keeps this pledge, then his reward will be with Allah. He who falls into shortcomings and was punished, then this will be his expiation. And those whose errors were covered by Allah, then their matter is for Allah&#59;If He wills, He will punish them and If He wills, He will pardon them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَذْنَبَ ذَنْبًا فِي الدُّنْيَا فَعُوقِبَ بِهِ فَاللهُ أَعْدَلُ مِنْ أَنْ يُثَنِّيَ عُقُوبَتَهُ عَلى عَبْدِهِ وَمَنْ أَذْنَبَ ذَنْبًا فِي الدُّنْيَا فَسَتَرهُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَعَفَا عَنْهُ فَاللهُ أَكْرَمُ مِنْ أَنْ يَعُودَ عَلَيْهِ فِي شَيْءٍ قَدْ عَفَا عَنْه <br /> <br />He who sins in this life and was punished for it, then Allah is far more just than to combine two punishments on His servant. He who commits an error in this life and Allah hides this error and pardons him, then Allah is far more generous than to punish the servant for something that He has already pardoned. <br /> <br />Recorded by Ahmad, Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi who said, &#34;<b>Hasan Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Ad-Daraqutni was asked about this <b>Hadith</b>, and he said that it was related to the Prophet in some narrations, and it was related to the Companions in others, and that this narration from the Prophet is Sahih. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement, <br />ذَلِكَ لَهُمْ خِزْيٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا <br /> (That is their disgrace in this world), <br /> <br />&#34;Meaning, shame, humiliation, punishment, contempt and torment in this life, before the Hereafter, <br />وَلَهُمْ فِي الاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> (and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter), if they do not repent from these errors until death overcomes them.

Once they felt well they slew the Prophet's shepherd and stole the herd of camels&#59; Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger, by fighting against Muslims, and hasten about the earth to do corruption there, by waylaying, is that they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, their right hands and left feet, or be banished from the land (the aw, `or', is [used] to indicate the [separate] application of [each of] the cases [listed]; thus, death is for those that have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and stolen property; the cutting off [of limbs on opposite sides] is for those that have stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those that pose a threat -- this was stated by Ibn `Abbs and is the opinion of al-Shfi`; the more sound of his [al-Shfi`'s] two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after [the] death [of the killer], or, it is also said, shortly before [he is killed]; with banishment are included similar punishments, such as imprisonment and the like). That, mentioned requital, is a degradation, a humiliation, for them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement, namely, the chastisement of the Fire.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is&#59; execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land&#59; that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 32" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> المائدة <span class="num-ar">5</span> : <span class="num-ar">33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah <span>5</span>:<span>33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 34" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
