Allah tests His servants with such game during their <b>Ihram</b>, that if they wish, they would be able to catch it with their hands. Allah has commanded them to avoid catching it.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said that, <br /> <br /> تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ <br /> (well within reach of your hands), refers to the young game and chicks, <br /> <br />while <br />وَرِمَاحُكُمْ <br /> (and your lances), refers to mature game. <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed during the <b>Umrah</b> of Al-Hudaybiyyah, when wild game and birds were coming to the Muslim camping area, which they had never seen the likes of before. Allah prohibited them from hunting the game while in the state of <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />لِيَعْلَمَ اللّهُ مَن يَخَافُهُ بِالْغَيْبِ <br /> <br />that Allah may test who fears Him in the unseen. <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah tests His servants with the game that comes near their camping area, for if they wish, they can catch it with their hands and spears in public and secret. This is how the obedience of those who obey Allah in public and secret becomes apparent and tested. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ <br /> <br />Verily! Those who fear their Lord in the unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise). (67&#59;12) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ <br /> <br />Then whoever transgresses thereafter, <br /> <br />According to As-Suddi, <br /> <br />after this warning and threat, then, <br /> <br />فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for him there is a painful torment. <br /> <br />for his defiance of Allah's command and what He has decreed. <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 93" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-93/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">94</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>94</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 95" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-95/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=94;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
