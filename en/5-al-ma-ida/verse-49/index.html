(6&#59;116) <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ka`b bin Asad, Ibn Saluba, Abdullah bin Surya and Shas bin Qays said to each other, `Let us go to Muhammad to try and misguide him from his religion.' <br /> <br />So they went to the Prophet and said, `O Muhammad! You know that we are the scholars, noblemen and chiefs of the Jews. If we follow you, the Jews will follow suit and will not contradict us. But, there is enmity between us and some of our people, so we will refer to you for judgment in this matter, and you should rule in our favor against them and we will believe in you.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah refused the offer and Allah sent down these <b>Ayat</b> about them, <br /> <br />وَأَنِ احْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَأ أَنزَلَ اللّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءهُمْ وَاحْذَرْهُمْ أَن يَفْتِنُوكَ عَن بَعْضِ مَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ إِلَيْكَ <br /> <br />And so judge between them by what Allah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you far away from some of that which Allah has sent down to you.) until, <b> <br />لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ <br /></b> (for a people who have firm faith.)&#34; (5&#59;49-50) <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Allah continues, <br /> <br />أَفَحُكْمَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ يَبْغُونَ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ اللّهِ حُكْمًا لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 48" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-48/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">49</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>49</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 50" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-50/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=49;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
