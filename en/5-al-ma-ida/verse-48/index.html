preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="ahmedali"><h3>Ahmed Ali</h3><p>And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3>Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We have sent down the true Book upon you, confirming the Books preceding it, and a protector and witness over them – therefore judge between them according to what is sent down by Allah, and O listener, do not follow their desires, abandoning the truth which has come to you; We have appointed for you all, a separate (religious) law and a way; and had Allah willed He could have made you one nation, but the purpose (His will) is to test you by what He has given you, therefore seek to surpass one another in good deeds; towards Allah only you will all return, so He will inform you concerning the matter in which you disputed.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3>Ali Ünal</h3><p>We have sent down to you (O Messenger) the Book with the truth (embodying it, and with nothing false in it), confirming (the Divine authorship of and the truths that are still contained by) whatever of the Book was revealed before it, and guarding over (all the true teachings in) it. Judge, then, between them by what God has sent down (to you), and do not follow their desires and caprices away from the truth that has come to you. For each (community to which a Messenger was sent with a Book) have We appointed a clear way of life and a comprehensive system (containing the principles of that way and how to follow it). And if God had so willed, He would surely have made you a single community (following the same way of life and system surrounded by the same conditions throughout all history); but (He willed it otherwise) in order to test you by what He granted to you (and thereby made you subject to a law of progress). Strive, then, together as if competing in good works. To God is the return of all of you, and He will then make you understand (the truth) about what you have differed on.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>And We have revealed to you this perfect Book comprising the truth and wisdom, fulfilling (the prophecies of) the Scripture which was present before it and stands as a guardian over it, then judge between them according to that which Allâh has revealed (of the Qur´ân), and do not deviate from the truth that has come to you in order to follow their low desires. For each one of you did We prescribe a spiritual law and a well-defined way (- a code in secular matters). And if Allâh had so willed He might have made you all one community (by force), but He wishes to show your perfection (the capacities and capabilities) that He has endowed you with. Therefore vie one with another in (doing) good deeds. To Allâh is the return of you all, then He will inform you as to that wherein you were at variance.</p></div><div id="arberry"><h3>  A. J. Arberry</h3><p>And We have sent down to thee the Book with the truth, confirming the Book that was before it, and assuring it. So judge between them according to what God has sent down, and do not follow their caprices, to forsake the truth that has come to thee. To every one of you We have appointed a right way and an open road. If God had willed, He would have made you one nation; but that He may try you in what has come to you. So be you forward in good works; unto God shall you return, all together; and He will tell you of that whereon you were at variance.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3>Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And We have sent down the Book unto thee with truth; and confirming that which hath preceded it of the Book, and a guardian thereof.

Unto each of you We appointed law and a way. And had Allah listed, He would have made you all a single community, but He willed not in order that he may prove you by that which He hath vouchsafed unto you.

If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allah; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3>Talal Itani</h3><p>And We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded it, and superseding it. So judge between them according to what God revealed, and do not follow their desires if they differ from the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have assigned a law and a method. Had God willed, He could have made you a single nation, but He tests you through what He has given you. So compete in righteousness. To God is your return, all of you; then He will inform you of what you had disputed.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3>English Literal</h3><p>And We descended to you The Book with the truth , confirming to what (is) between his hands from The Book , and guarding/protecting on it, so judge/rule between them with what God descended and do not follow their self attractions for desires about what came to you from the truth, to each from you We made/put God`s decreed way of life/method/law and order , and a clear/easy/plain way , and if God wanted/willed, He would have made you one nation/generation, and but to test you in what He gave you, so race/surpass (to) the goodnesses/generosity (good deeds), to God (is) your return altogether, so He informs you with what you were in it differing/disagreeing (P).</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3>Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Then We revealed the Book to you (O Muhammad!) with Truth, confirming whatever of the Book was revealed before, and protecting and guarding over it.

For each of you We have appointed a Law and a way of life. And had Allah so willed, He would surely have made you one single community; instead, (He gave each of you a Law and a way of life) in order to test you by what He gave you.

For each [community] among you We had appointed a code [of law] and a path, and had Allah wished He would have made you one community, but [His purposes required] that He should test you in respect to what He has given you.

It confirms the (original) Bible and has the authority to preserve or abrogate what the Bible contains. Judge among them by what God has revealed to you and do not follow their desires instead of the Truth which has come to you. We have given a law and a way of life to each of you. Had God wanted, He could have made you into one nation, but He wanted to see who are the more pious ones among you. Compete with each other in righteousness. All of you will return to God who will tell you the truth in the matter of your differences.</p></div><div id="shakir"><h3>Mohammad Habib Shakir</h3><p>And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it, therefore judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires (to turn away) from the truth that has come to you; for every one of you did We appoint a law and a way, and if Allah had pleased He would have made you (all) a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you, therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds; to Allah is your return, of all (of you), so He will let you know that in which you differed;</p></div><div id="wahiduddin"><h3>Wahiduddin Khan</h3><p>We have sent down the Book to you with the truth, fulfilling [the predictions] revealed in the previous scriptures and determining what is true therein, and as a guardian over it. Judge, therefore, between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their vain desires turning away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you We have ordained a law and a way, and had God so willed, He would have made you all a single community, but He did not so will, in order that He might try you by what He has given you. Vie, then, with one another in doing good works; to God you shall all return; then He will make clear to you about what you have been disputing.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3>Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety&#59; so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you&#59; so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3>Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur'n, with the truth (bi'l-haqq is semantically connected to anzaln, `We have revealed') confirming the Book that was before it and watching over it, testifying [to it] -- the `Book' means the Scriptures. So judge between them, between the People of the Scripture, if they take their cases before you, according to what God has revealed, to you, and do not follow their whims, deviating, away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you, O communities, We have appointed a divine law and a way, a clear path in religion, for them to proceed along. If God had willed, He would have made you one community, following one Law, but, He separated you one from the other, that He may try you in what He has given to you, of the differing Laws, in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works, strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return, through resurrection, and He will then inform you of that in which you differed, in the matter of religion, and requite each of you according to his deeds.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Praising the Qur'an; the Command to Refer to the Qur'an for Judgment</b> <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the <b>Tawrah</b> that He sent down to His Prophet Musa, the one whom He spoke directly to, praising it, commanding that it should be implemented, before it was abrogated. <br /> <br />Allah then mentioned the <b>Injil</b>, praised it and commanded its people to adhere to it and follow it, as we stated. <br /> <br />He next mentioned the Glorious Qur'an that He sent down to His honorable servant and Messenger. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ <br /> <br />And We have sent down to you the Book in truth..., <br /> <br />meaning, with the truth that, no doubt, is coming from Allah. <br /> <br />مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ <br /> <br />confirming the Scripture that came before it, <br /> <br />meaning, the Divinely Revealed Books that praised the Qur'an and mentioned that it would be sent down from Allah to His servant and Messenger Muhammad. <br /> <br />The Qur'an was revealed as was foretold in the previous Scriptures. This fact increased faith in the previous Scriptures for the sincere who have knowledge of these Scriptures, those who adhered to Allah's commands and Laws and believed in His Messengers. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلْ ءَامِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُوْمِنُواْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلٌّذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَأ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Believe in it or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration.&#34; And they say&#59;&#34;Glory be to our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.&#34; (17&#59;107-108), <br /> <br />meaning that they say, the promise of our Lord, concerning the coming of Muhammad by the words of His previous Messengers, will certainly be fulfilled. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />and <b>Muhayminan</b> over it, <br /> <br />According to Sufyan Ath-Thawri who narrated it from Abu Ishaq from At-Tamimi from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />means entrusted over it. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Muhaymin</b> is, `the Trustworthy'. <br /> <br />Allah says that the Qur'an is trustworthy over every Divine Book that preceded it.&#34; <br /> <br />This was reported from Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Qur'an is trustworthy over the Books that preceded it. Therefore, whatever in these previous Books conforms to the Qur'an is true, and whatever disagrees with the Qur'an is false.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Walibi said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /><b>Muhayminan</b> means, `Witness'. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi said the same. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /><b>Muhayminan</b> means, `dominant over the previous Scriptures'. <br /> <br />These meanings are similar, as the word <b>Muhaymin</b> includes them all. Consequently, the Qur'an is trustworthy, a witness, and dominant over every Scripture that preceded it. This Glorious Book, which Allah revealed as the Last and Final Book, is the most encompassing, glorious and perfect Book of all times. The Qur'an includes all the good aspects of previous Scriptures and even more, which no previous Scripture ever contained. This is why Allah made it trustworthy, a witness and dominant over all Scriptures. Allah promised that He will protect the Qur'an and swore by His Most Honorable Self, <br /> <br />إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ <br /> <br />Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the <b>Dhikr</b> and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). (15&#59;9) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ <br /> <br />So judge between them by what Allah has revealed. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands&#59;O Muhammad! Rule between the people, Arabs and non-Arabs, lettered and unlettered, by what Allah has revealed to you in this Glorious Book and what it approves of for you from the Law of the previous Prophets. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet had the choice to judge between them or to turn away from them and refer them to their own Law. Then this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br />وَأَنِ احْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَأ أَنزَلَ اللّهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءهُمْ <br /> (So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their vain desires...) (5&#59;49) and he was commanded to judge between them by our Book.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement <br /> <br />وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءهُمْ <br /> <br />and follow not their vain desires..., <br /> <br />This means the ideas they promote, because of which they turned away from what Allah revealed to His Messengers. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءهُمْ عَمَّا جَاءكَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ <br /> <br />And follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands&#59;Do not diverge from the truth that Allah has ordained for you, to the vain desires of these miserable, ignorant people. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا <br /> <br />To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. <br /> <br />لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً <br /> (To each among you, We have prescribed a law), <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn Abbas, <br /><b>Shir`at</b> meaning, a clear path. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً <br /> <br />If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation. <br /> <br />This is a general proclamation to all nations informing them of Allah's mighty ability. If Allah wills, He would make all mankind follow one religion and one Law, that would never be abrogated. Allah decided that every Prophet would have his own distinct law that is later abrogated partially or totally with the law of a latter Prophet. Later on, all previous laws were abrogated by the Law that Allah sent with Muhammad, His servant and Messenger, whom Allah sent to the people of earth as the Final Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَأ اتَاكُم <br /> <br />If Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, Allah has instituted different laws to test His servants' obedience to what He legislates for them, thus, He rewards or punishes them according to their actions and what they intend. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Kathir said that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />فِي مَأ اتَاكُم <br /> (In what He has given you), <br /> <br />means, of the Book. <br /> <br />Next, Allah encouraged rushing to perform good deeds, <br /> <br />فَاسْتَبِقُوا الخَيْرَاتِ <br /> <br />so strive as in a race in good deeds. <br /> <br />which are obedience to Allah, following His Law that abrogated the laws that came before it, and believing in His Book, the Qur'an, which is the Final Book that He revealed. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />إِلَى الله مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />The return of you (all) is to Allah; <br /> <br />Therefore, O people, your return and final destination is to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, <br /> <br />فَيُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ. <br /> <br />Allah will inform you about the truth in which you used to differ and will reward the sincere, as compensation for their sincerity, and will punish the disbelieving, rebellious people who rejected the truth and deviated from it to other paths, without proof or evidence to justify their actions. Rather, they have rejected the clear evidences, unequivocal proofs and established signs. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said that, <br />فَاسْتَبِقُوا الخَيْرَاتِ <br /> (So strive as in a race in good deeds), <br /> <br />is directed at the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad, but the first view is more apparent. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 47" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">48</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>48</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 49" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
