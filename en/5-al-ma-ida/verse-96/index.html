Abu Ubaydah ordered us to collect all the food for our journey, and it was collected in two bags of dates. <br /> <br />Abu Ubaydah kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, until it was exhausted. The share of each of us used to be one date only.&#34; <br /> <br />I (one of the narrators from Jabir) said, <br /> <br />&#34;How could one date suffice for you?&#34; <br /> <br />Jabir replied, &#34;We came to know its value when even that finished.&#34; <br /> <br />Jabir added, &#34;When we reached the seashore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu Ubaydah ordered that two of its ribs be affixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden, and it passed under the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Malik recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;A man asked Allah's Messenger, `O Allah's Messenger! We go to sea and carry little water with us. If we use it for <b>Wudu</b>, we get thirsty, so should we use seawater for <b>Wudu</b>?&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />هُوَ الطَّهُورُ مَاوُهُ الْحِلُّ مَيْتَتُه <br /> <br />Its water is pure and its dead are lawful.&#34; <br /> <br />The two Imams, Ash-Shafii and Ahmad bin Hanbal, recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, along with the Four <b>Sunan</b> compilers. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban graded it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also recorded from the Prophet by several other Companions. <br /><b>Hunting Land Game is Prohibited During Ihram</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَحُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَيْدُ الْبَرِّ مَا دُمْتُمْ حُرُمًا <br /> <br />but forbidden is land game as long as you are in a state of <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />Therefore, hunting land game during <b>Ihram</b> is not allowed, and <br /> <br />if someone who is in the state of <b>Ihram</b> hunts, he will have to pay expiation, along with the sin he earns if he does it intentionally. <br /> <br />If he hunts by mistake, he will have to pay the expiation and is not allowed to eat from it, because this type of game is just like dead animals, be he a <b>Muhrim</b> or a non-<b>Muhrim</b>. <br /> <br />If someone who is not in the state of <b>Ihram</b> hunts and gives the food to a <b>Muhrim</b>, the <b>Muhrim</b> is not allowed to eat from its meat if it was killed for him in particular. <br /> <br />As-Sa`b bin Jaththamah said that; <br /> <br />he gave a zebra as a gift to the Prophet in the area of Waddan or Abwa', the Prophet gave it back. When the Prophet saw the effect of his returning the gift on As-Sa`b's face, he said, <br /> <br />إِنَّا لَمْ نَرُدَّهُ عَلَيْكَ إِلاَّ أَنَّا حُرُم <br /> <br />We only gave it back to you because we are in a state of <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet thought that As-Sa`b hunted the zebra for him, and this is why he refused to take it. Otherwise, the <b>Muhrim</b> is allowed to eat from the game if one who is not in <b>Ihram</b> hunts it. <br /> <br />For when Abu Qatadah hunted a zebra when he was not a <b>Muhrim</b> and offered it to those who were in the state of <b>Ihram</b>, they hesitated to eat from it. <br /> <br />They asked the Messenger of Allah and he said, <br /> <br />هَلْ كَانَ مِنْكُمْ أَحَدٌ أَشَارَ إِلَيْهَا أَوْ أَعَانَ فِي قَتْلِهَا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Did any of you point at it or help kill it? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />فَكُلُوا <br /> <br />Then eat, (and he also ate from it). <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is also in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> with various wordings. <br /> <br /><i>(Ibn Kathir only mentioned <b>Ayat</b> 96 to 99 here and explained the better part of <b>Ayah</b> number 96, but he did not mention the explanation of the rest of that <b>Ayah</b> or the other <b>Ayat</b> (97 to 99). This is the case in all of the copies of his Tafsir in existence, and he might have forgotten to do that, for it is less likely that all who copied this book forgot to copy only this part. So we used a summary of the <b>Tafsir</b> of these <b>Ayat</b> from the Imam of <b>Tafsir</b>, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari. We tried to summarize At-Tabari's eloquent words to the best of our ability, by Allah's help and leave).</i> <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ الَّذِيَ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah to Whom you shall be gathered back. <br /> <br />Allah says, fear Allah, O people, and beware of His might, by obeying what He commands you and avoiding what He prohibits for you in these <b>Ayat</b> revealed to your Prophet. <br /> <br />These <b>Ayat</b> forbid <b>Khamr</b>, gambling, <b>Al-Ansab</b> and <b>Al-Azlam</b>, along with hunting land game and killing it while in the state of <b>Ihram</b>. To Allah will be your return and destination, and He will punish you for disobeying Him and will reward you for obeying Him</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>Permitted to you, O people, be you in pilgrimage inviolability or not, is the game of the sea, for consumption, and it is what can only live in the sea, such as fish, but not what is able to live both in the sea and on land, such as crabs; and food from it, what it casts out that is dead, is a provision for you, for you to consume, and for the wayfarers, the travellers among you, to take as their provisions; but forbidden to you is the hunting of game on the land, and this consists of those edible beasts that live on it; do not hunt them, so long as you remain in pilgrimage inviolability&#59; if it is caught by one not in pilgrimage inviolability, then it is permissible for a person in pilgrimage inviolability to consume it, as is clarified in the Sunna; and fear God, to whom you shall be gathered.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food,- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game;- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb.
