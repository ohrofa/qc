(9&#59;74) <br /> <br />In an agreed upon <b>Hadith</b>, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا يَنْقِمُ ابْنُ جَمِيلٍ إِلاَّ أَنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَأَغْنَاهُ الله <br /> <br />What caused Ibn Jamil to <b>Yanqim</b> (refuse to give <b>Zakah</b>), although he was poor and Allah made him rich! <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَأَنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ فَاسِقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and that most of you are rebellious... <br /> <br />is connected to <br />أَنْ امَنَّا بِاللّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> (that we believe in Allah, and in that which has been sent down to us and in that which has been sent down before (us)). Therefore, the meaning of this part of the <b>Ayah</b> is&#59;we also believe that most of you are rebellious and deviated from the straight path. <br /><b>The People of the Scriptures Deserve the Worst Torment on the Day of Resurrection</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 58" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 60" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
