So fear not men, but fear you Me; and sell not My signs for a little price. Whoso judges not according to what God has sent down - they are the unbelievers.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>We revealed the Torah with guidance and light, and the prophets, who had submitted to God, judged according to it for the Jews. So did the rabbis and the scholars in accordance with that part of God’s Scripture which they were entrusted to preserve, and to which they were witnesses. So [rabbis and scholars] do not fear people, fear Me; do not barter away My messages for a small price; those who do not judge according to what God has sent down are rejecting [God’s teachings].</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Verily We sent down the Taurat wherein was a guidance and a light. By it the prophets who submitted themselves judged those who were judaised, and so did the divines and the priests by that wherewith they were entrusted of the Book of Allah and they had become witnesses thereof. Wherefore fear not the mankind but fear Me, and barter not My revelations for a small price, And whosoever judgeth not by that which Allah hath sent down - those then they are the infidels.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>It was We who revealed the law (to Moses)&#59; therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law&#59; for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto&#59; therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Surely We revealed the Torah, wherein there is guidance and light. Thereby did Prophets - who had submitted themselves (to Allah) - judge for the Judaized folk; and so did the scholars and jurists. They judged by the Book of Allah for they had been entrusted to keep it, and bear witness to it. So (O Jews!) do not fear men but fear Me, and do not barter away My signs for a trivial gain. Those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are indeed the unbelievers.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God's writ.

The prophets, who had submitted, judged by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the scribes, as they were charged to preserve the Book of Allah and were witnesses to it. So do not fear the people, but fear Me, and do not sell My signs for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down—it is they who are the faithless.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>Surely We did send down the Torah, in which there was guidance and a light (to illuminate people’s minds, hearts and ways of life). Thereby did the Prophets, who were fully submitted to God, judge for the Jews; and so did the masters (self-dedicated to God and educating people) and the rabbis (teachers of law), as they had been entrusted to keep and observe the part of God’s Book (revealed up to their time); and they were all witnesses to its truth. (Concerning judging by God’s Book and observing It, We warned them saying): Do not hold people in awe, but stand in awe of Me; and do not sell My Revelations for a trifling price. Whoever (declines to confirm and) does not judge by what God has sent down, those are indeed unbelievers.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Verily, it is We Who revealed Torah wherein there was guidance and light. According to it the Prophets, who submitted themselves (to Us), did judge for those who judaised and (so also did) the teachers of Divine knowledge, and those learned (in the Law); (they did it) because they were required to preserve some of the Scripture of Allâh and (because) they stood guardians over it. Hence hold not people in awe but stand in awe of Me and do not barter away My Messages for a trifling gain. And he who does not judge according to that (law) which Allâh has revealed, it is these who are the real disbelievers.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>That We descended the Torah/Old Testament, in it (is) guidance and light, the prophets those who submitted/surrendered , judge/rule with it, to those who guided/Jews , and the knowledgeable Lord worshippers , and the religious scholars with what they memorized/safe kept (learned) from God`s Book , and they were not on it witnessing/present ; so do not fear the people and fear Me, and do not buy/volunteer with My signs/verses a small price, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, they are the disbelievers.</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>Undoubtedly We sent down the Taurat, in which is guidance and light; the Jews were commanded according to it by Our obedient Prophets, and the rabbis and the religious jurists for they were commanded to protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it; so do not fear men, and fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for an abject price; and whoever does not judge according to what is sent down by Allah - it is they who are disbelievers.</p></div><div id="hamid-s-aziz"><h3><span>13</span> Hamid S.

Therefore fear not men but fear Me (O Jews) and sell not My Verses for a miserable price.

So did the godly people and the Jewish scholars who remembered some parts of the Book of God and bore witness to it. Mankind, do not be afraid of people but have fear of Me.

By it the prophets who were obedient to Us judged the Jews, and so did the rabbis and the priests, according to God's Book which had been entrusted to their care; and to which they were witnesses. Have no fear of man; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a paltry sum. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are deniers of truth.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light. The submissive prophets ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rabbis and the scholars, as they were required to protect God’s Book, and were witnesses to it. So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My revelations for a cheap price. Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the unbelievers.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Surely We revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance, from error, and light, that is, an exposition of the rulings, by which the prophets, from the Children of Israel, who had submitted, [who] had been compliant before God, judged for those of Jewry, as did the rabbis, the scholars among them, and the priests, the jurists, according to, because of, that which they were bidden to observe, [that which] was entrusted to them, that is to say, [that which] God bid them to observe, of God's Scripture, lest they change it, and were witnesses to, its truth. So do not fear men, O Jews, in disclosing what you have pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s), the `stoning' verse and otherwise; but fear Me, when you conceal it; and do not sell, do not exchange, My signs for a small price, of this world, which you take in return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed -- such are the disbelievers, in it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ <br /> <br />Verily, We did send down the <b>Tawrah</b> (to Musa), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged the Jews. <br /> <br />and these Prophets did not deviate from the law of the <b>Tawrah</b>, change or alter it, <br /> <br /> وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالَاحْبَارُ <br /> <br />And (also) the <b>Rabbaniyyun</b> and the <b>Ahbar</b>..., <br /> <br />wherein <b>Rabbaniyyun</b> refers to the worshippers who are learned and religious, <br /> <br />and <b>Ahbar</b> refers to the scholars, <br /> <br />بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَابِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, <br /> <br />meaning, they were entrusted with the Book of Allah, and they were commanded to adhere to it and not hide any part of. <br /> <br />وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَاء فَلَ تَخْشَوُاْ النَّاسَ وَاخْشَوْنِ وَلَا تَشْتَرُواْ بِأيَاتِي ثَمَنًا قَلِيلً وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear not men but fear Me and sell not My verses for a miserable price. And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers. <br /> <br />There are two ways to explain this <b>Ayah</b> and we will mention the later. <br /><b>Another Reason Behind Revealing these Honorable Ayat</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah sent down the <b>Ayat</b>, <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ <br /> (And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers), <br />فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ <br /> (Such are the unjust), (5&#59;45) and, <br />فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ <br /> (Such are the rebellious), (5&#59;47) about two groups among the Jews. <br /> <br />During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, one of them had defeated the other. As a result, they made a treaty that they would pay blood money totaling fifty <b>Wasaq</b> (of gold) (each <b>Wasaq</b> approx. 3 kg) for every dead person from the defeated group killed by the victors, and a hundred <b>Wasaq</b> for every dead person the defeated group killed from the victors. <br /> <br />This treaty remained in effect until the Prophet came to Al-Madinah and both of these groups became subservient under the Prophet. Yet, when the mighty group once suffered a casualty at the hands of the weaker group, the mighty group sent a delegation demanding the hundred <b>Wasaq</b>. The weaker group said, `How can two groups who have the same religion, one ancestral lineage and a common land, have a <b>Diyah</b> that for some of them is half of that of the others We only agreed to this because you oppressed us and because we feared you. Now that Muhammad has come, we will not give you what you asked.' <br /> <br />So war was almost rekindled between them, but they agreed to seek Muhammad's judgment in their dispute. The mighty group among them said (among themselves), `By Allah! Muhammad will never give you double the <b>Diyah</b> that you pay to them compared to what they pay to you. They have said the truth anyway, for they only gave us this amount because we oppressed and overpowered them. Therefore, send someone to Muhammad who will sense what his judgment will be. If he agrees to give you what you demand, accept his judgment, and if he does not give you what you seek, do not refer to him for judgment.' <br /> <br />So they sent some hypocrites to the Messenger of Allah to try and find out the Messenger's judgment. When they came to the Messenger, Allah informed him of their matter and of their plot. Allah sent down, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ لَا يَحْزُنكَ الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْكُفْرِ <br /></b>(O Messenger! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you), (5&#59;41) until, <br />الْفَاسِقُونَ <br /> (Such are the rebellious). (5&#59;47) <br /> <br />By Allah! It is because of their problem that Allah sent down these verses and it is they whom Allah meant.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud collected a similar narration for this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Jafar Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>Al-Ma'idah</b>, <br />فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُم أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ <br /> (either judge between them, or turn away from them...) until, <br />الْمُقْسِطِينَ <br /> (Those who act justly), (5&#59;42) was revealed concerning the problem of blood money between Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah. <br /> <br />The dead of Bani An-Nadir were being honored more and they received the full amount of <b>Diyah</b>, while Qurayzah received half the <b>Diyah</b> for their dead. So they referred to the Messenger of Allah for judgment and Allah sent down these verses about them. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah compelled them to adhere to the true judgment in this matter and made the <b>Diyah</b> the same for both groups and Allah knows best about that matter.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded this <b>Hadith</b> from Abu Ishaq. Al-Awfi and Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said that these <b>Ayat</b> were revealed about the two Jews who committed adultery, and we mentioned the <b>Hadiths</b> about this story before. <br /> <br />It appears that both of these were the reasons behind revealing these <b>Ayat</b>, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said afterwards, <br />وَكَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيهَا أَنَّ النَّفْسَ بِالنَّفْسِ وَالْعَيْنَ بِالْعَيْنِ <br />(And We ordained therein for them&#59;Life for life, eye for eye) until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>, (5&#59;45) which strengthens the opinion that the story of the <b>Diyah</b> was behind revealing the <b>Ayat</b> as we explained above. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ <br /> <br />And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers. <br /> <br />Al-Bara' bin Azib, Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, Ibn Abbas, Abu Mijlaz, Abu Raja' Al-Utaridi, Ikrimah, Ubaydullah bin Abdullah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about the People of the Book. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri added that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> also applies to us. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Ath-Thawri said that Mansur said that Ibrahim said that; <br /> <br />these <b>Ayat</b>, &#34;Were revealed about the Children of Israel, and Allah accepted them for this <b>Ummah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded this statement. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah also stated that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ <br /></b> (And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers), <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever rejects what Allah has revealed, will have committed <b>Kufr</b>, and whoever accepts what Allah has revealed, but did not rule by it, is a <b>Zalim</b> (unjust) and a <b>Fasiq</b> (rebellious) and a sinner.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded this statement. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ma`mar narrated to us that Tawus said that Ibn Abbas was asked about Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم <br /></b> (And whosoever does not judge...). <br /> <br />He said, `It is an act of <b>Kufr</b>.' <br /> <br />Ibn Tawus added, <br /> <br />`It is not like those who disbelieve in Allah, His angels, His Books and His Messengers.' <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri narrated that Ibn Jurayj said that Ata said, <br /> <br />`There is <b>Kufr</b> and <b>Kufr</b> less than <b>Kufr</b>, <b>Zulm</b> and <b>Zulm</b> less than <b>Zulm</b>, Fisq and <b>Fisq</b> less than <b>Fisq</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Waki` said that Sa`id Al-Makki said that Tawus said that, <b> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ <br /></b> (And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers), <br /> <br />&#34;This is not the <b>Kufr</b> that annuls one's religion.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 43" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 45" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
