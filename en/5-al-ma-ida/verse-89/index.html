We also mentioned that the <b>Laghw</b> in oaths refers to one's saying, &#34;No by Allah,&#34; or, &#34;Yes, by Allah,&#34; unintentionally. <br /><b>Expiation for Breaking the Oaths</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن يُوَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ الَايْمَانَ <br /> <br />but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths. <br /> <br />in reference to the oaths that you intend in your hearts, <br /> <br />فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَاكِينَ <br /> <br />for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten poor, <br /> <br />who are needy, not able to find necessities of the life. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ <br /> <br />on a scale of the <b>Awsat</b> of that with which you feed your own families; <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ikrimah, <br /> <br />means, &#34;On the average scale of what you feed your families.&#34; <br /> <br />Ata Al-Khurasani commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;From the best of what you feed your families.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ <br /> <br />or clothe them, <br /> <br />refers to clothing each of the ten persons with what is suitable to pray in, whether the poor person was male or female. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> means a robe or garment for each poor person (of the ten). <br /> <br />Mujahid also said that; <br /> <br />the least of clothing, referred to in the <b>Ayah</b>, is a garment, and the most is whatever you wish. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan, Abu Jafar Al-Baqir, Ata, Tawus, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Hammad bin Abi Sulayman and Abu Malik said that; <br /> <br />it means (giving each of the ten poor persons) a garment each. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ <br /> <br />or free a slave, <br /> <br />refers to freeing a believing slave. <br /> <br />In the <b>Muwatta</b> of Malik, the <b>Musnad</b> of Ash-Shafii and the <b>Sahih</b> of Muslim, a lengthy <b>Hadith</b> was recorded that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Al-Hakam As-Sulami said that he once had to free a slave (as atonement) and he brought a black slave girl before the Messenger of Allah, who asked her; <br /> <br />أَيْنَ اللهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Where is Allah? <br /> <br />She said, &#34;Above the heavens.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَنَا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Who am I? <br /> <br />She said, &#34;The Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَعْتِقْهَا فَإِنَّهَا مُوْمِنَة <br /> <br />Free her, for she is a believer. <br /> <br />There are three types of expiation for breaking deliberate oaths, and whichever one chooses, it will suffice, according to the consensus (of the scholars). <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the easiest, then the more difficult options, since feeding is easier than giving away clothes, and giving away clothes is easier than freeing a slave. <br /> <br />If one is unable to fulfill any of these options, then he fasts for three days for expiation, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَثَةِ أَيَّامٍ <br /> <br />But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b and Ibn Mas`ud and his students read this <b>Ayah</b> as follows, <br /> <br />&#34;Then he should fast three consecutive days.&#34; <br /> <br />Even if this statement was not narrated to us as a part of the Qur'an through <b>Mutawatir</b> narration, it would still be an explanation of the Qur'an by the Companions that has the ruling of being related from the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ كَفَّارَةُ أَيْمَانِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ <br /> <br />That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. <br /> <br />means, this is the legal way to atone for deliberate oaths, <br /> <br />وَاحْفَظُواْ أَيْمَانَكُمْ <br /> <br />And protect your oaths. <br /> <br />Do not leave your broken oaths without paying the expiation for them, according to the meaning given by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ ايَاتِهِ <br /> <br />Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat, <br /> <br />and explains them to you, <br /> <br />لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that you may be grateful.</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;idah Verse 88" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-88/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">89</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>89</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;idah Verse 90" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=89;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
