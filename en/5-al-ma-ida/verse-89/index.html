That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn; but keep your oaths.

This is the atonement for breaking your oaths- keep your oaths. In this way God makes clear His revelations to you, so that you may be thankful.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Allah shall not take you to task for the vain in your oaths; but he shall take you to task for that which your oaths make binding. The expiation thereof is the feeding of ten of the needy with the middle sort of that wherewith ye feed your households, or the clothing of them or the freeing of a neck; but whosoever cannot find, far him is a fasting of three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn and bear in mind your oaths. Thus doth Allah expound unto you His commandments, that haply ye may return thanks.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths&#59; for expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs, that ye may be grateful.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>Allah does not take you to task for the oaths you utter vainly, but He will certainly take you to task for the oaths you have sworn in earnest. The expiation (for breaking such oaths) is either to feed ten needy persons with more or less the same food as you are wont to give to your families, or to clothe them, or to set free from bondage the neck of one man; and he who does not find the means shall fast for three days. This shall be the expiation for your oaths whenever you have sworn (and broken them.) But do keep your oaths.

The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths.

If anyone does not find (the means to do that), let him fast for three days. That is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn (and broken them). But be mindful of your oaths (do not make them lightly, and when you have sworn them, fulfill them). Thus God makes clear to you His Revelations (the lights of His way), that you may give thanks (from the heart and in speech, and in action by fulfilling His commandments).</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>Allâh will not call you to account for (such of) your oaths as are vain, but He will call you to account for (breaking) the oaths which you take in earnest (for doing a thing or not doing). The expiation for breaking such an oath is the feeding of ten needy persons (the average food) as you feed your own families with, or provide them with clothes, or liberating of some one (from the yoke of slavery or debt etc.) But whoever does not find (the means to do any of these), then he shall fast for three days. That is how you expiate your oaths when you have sworn them solemnly (and then break them). But do guard your oaths.

The expiation for breaking an oath is to feed ten needy people with food, typical of that which you feed to your own people, to clothe them or to set a slave free. One who cannot pay this, he must fast for three days to expiate his oaths. Keep your oaths.

Thus God makes clear His Revelations to you, that you may be grateful.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>God will not take you to task for a slip, contained, in your oaths, which is what the tongue utters spontaneously, without intending to swear an oath, such as when one says, `No, by God', or `Yes, by God'; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged (read `aqadtum, `aqqadttum or `qadttum) oaths, where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof, of the oath if you break it, is the feeding of ten of the needy, for each needy person one mudd measure, of the midmost food, from which, you feed your families, that is, the closest or the principal [food you consume], neither better, nor worse; or the clothing of them, with what may be [properly] called clothes, such as a shirt, a turban, or a loin cloth -- it is not sufficient that these [items] mentioned be given only to one needy person, according to al-Shfi`; or the setting free of a, believing, slave, as applies in the expiation for slaying or repudiation through zihr, interpreting the general [stipulation] in a restricted sense; and whoever does not find the means, for any one of the [expiations] mentioned, then the fasting of three days, as an expiation for him -- as it appears [in this verse], it is not obligatory to follow the [above] sequence [of alternatives when making an expiation], and this is the opinion of al-Shfi`. That, which is mentioned, is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn, and have broken them; but keep your oaths, do not break them, unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people, as stated in the verse of srat al-Baqara [Q. 2&#59;225]. So, in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear to you His signs, so that you might be thankful, to Him for this.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Unintentional Oaths</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لَا يُوَاخِذُكُمُ اللّهُ بِاللَّغْوِ فِي أَيْمَانِكُمْ <br /> <br />Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, <br /> <br />We mentioned the subject of unintentional oaths in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>, all praise and thanks are due to Allah, and so we do not need to repeat it here. We also mentioned that the <b>Laghw</b> in oaths refers to one's saying, &#34;No by Allah,&#34; or, &#34;Yes, by Allah,&#34; unintentionally. <br /><b>Expiation for Breaking the Oaths</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن يُوَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ الَايْمَانَ <br /> <br />but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths. <br /> <br />in reference to the oaths that you intend in your hearts, <br /> <br />فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَاكِينَ <br /> <br />for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten poor, <br /> <br />who are needy, not able to find necessities of the life. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ <br /> <br />on a scale of the <b>Awsat</b> of that with which you feed your own families; <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ikrimah, <br /> <br />means, &#34;On the average scale of what you feed your families.&#34; <br /> <br />Ata Al-Khurasani commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;From the best of what you feed your families.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ <br /> <br />or clothe them, <br /> <br />refers to clothing each of the ten persons with what is suitable to pray in, whether the poor person was male or female. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> means a robe or garment for each poor person (of the ten). <br /> <br />Mujahid also said that; <br /> <br />the least of clothing, referred to in the <b>Ayah</b>, is a garment, and the most is whatever you wish. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan, Abu Jafar Al-Baqir, Ata, Tawus, Ibrahim An-Nakhai, Hammad bin Abi Sulayman and Abu Malik said that; <br /> <br />it means (giving each of the ten poor persons) a garment each. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ <br /> <br />or free a slave, <br /> <br />refers to freeing a believing slave. <br /> <br />In the <b>Muwatta</b> of Malik, the <b>Musnad</b> of Ash-Shafii and the <b>Sahih</b> of Muslim, a lengthy <b>Hadith</b> was recorded that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Al-Hakam As-Sulami said that he once had to free a slave (as atonement) and he brought a black slave girl before the Messenger of Allah, who asked her; <br /> <br />أَيْنَ اللهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Where is Allah? <br /> <br />She said, &#34;Above the heavens.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَنَا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Who am I? <br /> <br />She said, &#34;The Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَعْتِقْهَا فَإِنَّهَا مُوْمِنَة <br /> <br />Free her, for she is a believer. <br /> <br />There are three types of expiation for breaking deliberate oaths, and whichever one chooses, it will suffice, according to the consensus (of the scholars). <br /> <br />Allah mentioned the easiest, then the more difficult options, since feeding is easier than giving away clothes, and giving away clothes is easier than freeing a slave. <br /> <br />If one is unable to fulfill any of these options, then he fasts for three days for expiation, just as Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَثَةِ أَيَّامٍ <br /> <br />But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b and Ibn Mas`ud and his students read this <b>Ayah</b> as follows, <br /> <br />&#34;Then he should fast three consecutive days.&#34; <br /> <br />Even if this statement was not narrated to us as a part of the Qur'an through <b>Mutawatir</b> narration, it would still be an explanation of the Qur'an by the Companions that has the ruling of being related from the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ كَفَّارَةُ أَيْمَانِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ <br /> <br />That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. <br /> <br />means, this is the legal way to atone for deliberate oaths, <br /> <br />وَاحْفَظُواْ أَيْمَانَكُمْ <br /> <br />And protect your oaths. <br /> <br />Do not leave your broken oaths without paying the expiation for them, according to the meaning given by Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ ايَاتِهِ <br /> <br />Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat, <br /> <br />and explains them to you, <br /> <br />لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that you may be grateful.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 88" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-88/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">89</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>89</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 90" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
