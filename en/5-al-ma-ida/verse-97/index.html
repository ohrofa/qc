Thus, these symbols were just like the chief who is obeyed by his followers, and who upholds harmony and public safety. As for the <b>Ka`bah</b>, it includes the entire sacred boundary. <br /> <br />Allah termed it &#34;<b>Haram</b>&#34; because He prohibited hunting its game and cutting its trees or grass. <br /> <br />Similarly, the <b>Ka`bah</b>, the Sacred Month, the animals of offerings and the garlands were the landmarks of existing Arabs. These symbols were sacred during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and the people's affairs were guided and protected by them. With Islam they became the symbols of their <b>Hajj</b>, their rituals, and the direction of the prayer, i.e., the <b>Ka`bah</b> in Makkah. <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ لِتَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الَارْضِ وَأَنَّ اللّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that you may know that Allah has knowledge of all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and that Allah is the All-Knower of each and everything. <br /> <br />Allah says; O people, I made these symbols an asylum for you, so that you know that He Who made these symbols that benefit your life and provide you with security, also knows everything in the heavens and earth that brings about your immediate or eventual benefit. Know that He has perfect knowledge of everything and that none of your deeds or affairs ever escapes His observation; and He will count them for you so that He rewards those who do good with the same and those who do evil in kind. <br /> <br />اعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ وَأَنَّ اللّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 96" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-96/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">97</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>97</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 98" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-98/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=97;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
