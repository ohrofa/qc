are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], Allah extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and Allah does not like corrupters.</p></div><div id="featured_1" class="featured"></div><div class="translation-wrapper"><div id="arberry"><h3><span>1</span>   A. J. Arberry</h3><p>The Jews have said, 'God's hand is fettered.' Fettered are their hands, and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands are outspread; He expends how He will. And what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred, till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they light a fire for war, God will extinguish it. They hasten about the earth, to do corruption there; and God loves not the workers of corruption.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>The Jews have said, ‘God is tight-fisted,’ but it is they who are tight-fisted, and they are rejected for what they have said. Truly, God’s hands are open wide: He gives as He pleases. What has been sent down to you from your Lord is sure to increase insolence and defiance in many of them. We have sown enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, God will put it out. They try to spread corruption in the land, but God does not love those who corrupt.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>And the Jews say: the hand of God is fettered. Fettered be their own hands, and cursed be they for that which they have said! Aye! His both hands are wide open. He expendeth howsoever He listeth. And surely that which hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord increaseth many of them in exorbitance and infidelity. And We have cast among them enmity and spite till the Day of Judgement: so oft as they kindle the fire of War Allah extinguisheth it, and they strive after corruption in the land, and Allah approveth not the corrupters.</p></div><div id="yusufali"><h3><span>4</span> Abdullah Yusuf Ali</h3><p>The Jews say&#59; &#34;Allah's hand is tied up.&#34; Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched&#59; He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief.</p></div><div id="maududi"><h3><span>5</span> Abul Ala Maududi</h3><p>The Jews say: 'The Hand of Allah is fettered. It is their own hands which are fettered, and they stand cursed for the evil they have uttered. No! His Hands are outspread; He spends as He wills. Surely the message that has been revealed to you from your Lord has increased many of them in their in-surgence and unbelief, and so We have cast enmity and spite among them until the Day of Resurrection. And as often as they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it; and they go about trying to spread mischief on earth, whereas Allah does not love those who spread mischief.</p></div><div id="ahmedali"><h3><span>6</span> Ahmed Ali</h3><p>The Jews say: &#34;Bound are the hands of God.&#34; Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say! In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>And the Jews said, “Allah’s hand is tied&#34;; may their hands be tied – and they are accursed for saying so! In fact, both His hands* are free, He bestows upon whomever He wills; and O dear Prophet, this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; and We have instilled enmity and hatred between them till the Day of Resurrection; whenever they ignite the flame of war, Allah extinguishes it, and they strive to create chaos in the land; and Allah does not love the mischievous. (* This is a metaphor used to express Allah’s power).</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is tied up.’ Tied up be their hands, and cursed be they for what they say! No, His hands are wide open: He bestows as He wishes. Surely many of them will be increased in rebellion and unfaith by what has been sent to you from your Lord, and We have cast enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they ignite the flames of war, Allah puts them out. They seek to cause corruption on the earth, and Allah does not like the agents of corruption.</p></div><div id="ali-unal"><h3><span>9</span> Ali Ünal</h3><p>The Jews say: &#34;God’s Hand is fettered&#34; (thus attributing their humiliation and misery to Him). Be their hands fettered and be they excluded from His mercy for saying so! No indeed! both His Hands are spread out wide in bounty, bestowing as He wills. And (the Revelation and bounties) that are sent down to you from your Lord indeed increase many of them in rebellion and unbelief. However (according to the laws We established for human life in the world), We have cast enmity and hateful rancor among them to last until the Day of Resurrection: as often as they kindle a fire of war (to overcome Islam and put it off), God extinguishes it (without allowing them to attain to their goal). They hasten about the earth causing disorder and corruption, and God does not love those who cause disorder and corruption.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3><span>10</span> Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>And the Jews said, `Allâh´s hand is fettered (from assisting the helpless Muslims).´ Fettered are their own hands (from assisting the enemies of Islam), and they are deprived of blessings of Allâh for what they said. Nay, (the truth of the matter is that) both His hands are wide open (and free). He spends as He pleases. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will most surely increase many of them in inordinate rebellion and in disbelief. And We have kindled enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle a fire for war, Allâh puts it out, but they strive to create disorder in the land, whereas Allâh does not like the creators of disorder.</p></div><div id="literal"><h3><span>11</span> English Literal</h3><p>And the Jews said: &#34;God`s hand (is) chained or tied.&#34; (But) their hands (are) chained or tied, and they were cursed/humiliated because (of) what they said, but His two hands (are) outspread/outstretched , He spends how (as) He wills/wants; and what was descended to you from your Lord increases (E) many of them tyranny/arrogance and disbelief, and We threw between them the animosity and the intense hatred to the Resurrection Day, whenever they ignited a fire to the battle/war , God extinguished it , and they strive/hasten in the earth/Planet Earth (in) corruption , and God does not love/like the corrupting.</p></div><div id="faridul-haque"><h3><span>12</span> Faridul Haque</h3><p>And the Jews said, “Allah’s hand* is tied&#34;; may their hands be tied - and they are accursed for saying so!

God, exalted be He, says&#59; Fettered be, withheld be, their hands, from the performance of good deeds, as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands are extended out wide -- a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity -- the use of [yad] the dual for yad, `hand', is intended to imply abundance, since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will, in giving abundantly or straitening, and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur'n, will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their [very] disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war, that is, for war against the Prophet (s), God extinguishes them, that is, every time they desire it [war], He repels them. And they hasten about the earth in corruption, that is, [they hasten about] corrupting, through acts of disobedience, and God does not love corrupters, meaning that He will punish them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Jews Say That Allah's Hand is Tied up!</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ <br /> <br />The Jews say&#59;&#34;Allah's Hand is tied up.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah states that the Jews, may Allah's continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. <br /> <br />The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ <br /></b> (The Jews say, &#34;Allah's Hand is tied up&#34;). <br /> <br />&#34;They do not mean that Allah's Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#34; Similar was reported from Mujahid, Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. <br /> <br />Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ وَلَا تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ الْبَسْطِ <br /> <br />فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُومًا مَّحْسُورًا <br /> <br /> <br />And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. (17&#59;29) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. <br /> <br />Allah describes stinginess by saying, <br />وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ <br /> (And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck). <br /> <br />Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah's curses be on them. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. <br /> <br />We mentioned before that Finhas said, <b> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَاء <br /></b> &#34;(Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!)&#34; (3&#59;181), and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْ <br /> <br />Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. <br /> <br />What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. <br /> <br />Allah said in other Ayat, <br /> <br />أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذاً لاَّ يُوْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيراً <br /> <br />أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ عَلَى مَأ ءَاتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ فَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَأ ءَالَ إِبْرَهِيمَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ مُّلْكاً عَظِيماً <br /> <br />Or have they a share in the dominion! Then in that case they would not give mankind even a <b>Naqir</b>. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty! Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the <b>Hikmah</b>, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. (4&#59;53-54) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ <br /> <br />Indignity is put over them. (3&#59;112) <br /><b>Allah's Hands are Widely Outstretched</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاء <br /> <br />Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills. <br /> <br />Allah's favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا إِنَّ الانْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ <br /> <br />And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate. (13&#59;34) <br /> <br />There are many other <b>Ayat</b> on this subject. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ يَمِينَ اللهِ مَلَْى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَات وَالاَْرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ قال وَعَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ وَفِي يَدِهِ الاَْخُرى الْقَبْضُ يَرْفَعُ وَيَخْفِض <br /> <br />Allah's Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers. <br /> <br />He also said that Allah said, <br /> <br />أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك <br /> <br />`Spend and I will spend on you.&#34;' <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /><b>The Revelation to the Muslims only Adds to the Transgression and Disbelief of the Jews</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم مَّا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا <br /> <br />Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. <br /> <br />meaning, the bounty that comes to you, O Muhammad, is a calamity for your enemies, the Jews and their kind. The more the revelation increases the believers in faith, good works, and beneficial knowledge, the more the disbelievers increase in envy for you and your <b>Ummah</b>, the more they increase in <b>Tughyan</b> -- which is to exceed the ordained limits for things -- and in disbelief -- meaning denial of you. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَأءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُوْلَـيِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away.&#34; (41&#59;44) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَأءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُوْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا <br /> <br />And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases wrongdoers in nothing but loss. (17&#59;82) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاء إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /> <br />We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Therefore, their hearts are never united. Rather, their various groups and sects will always have enmity and hatred for each other, because they do not agree on the truth, and because they opposed you and denied you. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كُلَّمَا أَوْقَدُواْ نَارًا لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا اللّهُ <br /> <br />Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; <br /> <br />means, every time they try to plot against you and kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it and makes their plots turn against them. Therefore, their evil plots will return to harm them. <br /> <br />وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الَارْضِ فَسَادًا وَاللّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they (ever) strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers. <br /> <br />It is their habit to always strive to cause mischief on the earth, and Allah does not like those with such behavior. <br /><b>Had the People of the Book Adhered to their Book, they Would Have Acquired the Good of this Life and the Hereafter</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 63" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-63/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">64</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>64</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 65" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-65/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=64;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
