The interposing of the wiping of the head between [the mention of] the hands and the feet, which are washed, is intended to show the requirement of [a specific] order during the purification of these limbs, as al-Shfi` asserts. In addition, the requirement of making intention (niyya) in this [ablution], as in the other rituals of worship, is taken from the Sunna. If you are defiled, purify, wash, yourselves; but if you are sick, with an illness made worse by water, or on a journey, travelling, or if any of you comes from the privy, that is, [if] he has defecated, or you have touched women (as mentioned already in the verse in [srat] al-Nis' [Q. 4&#59;43]), and you cannot find water, having made the effort to look for it, then head for, seek, wholesome dust, that is, clean earth, and wipe your faces and your hands, including the elbows, with it, using two strikes (the b' of bi-wujhikum, `your faces', denotes `adherence'; it is explained in the Sunna that the requirement here is for the wiping to encompass the whole of these two parts. God does not desire to make any hardship for you, any constraint, in the obligations He has imposed on you with regard to ablution, washing and purification with dust; but He desires to purify you, of filth and sins, and that He may perfect His grace upon you, through Islam, by explaining the laws of the religion; so that you might give thanks, for His graces.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>The Order to Perform Wudu</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلةِ <br /> <br />When you stand for (intend to offer) the <b>Salah</b>, <br /> <br />Allah commanded performing <b>Wudu</b> for the prayer. This is a command of obligation in the case of impurity, and in the case of purity, it is merely a recommendation. <br /> <br />It was said that in the beginning of Islam, Muslims had to perform <b>Wudu</b> for every prayer, but later on, this ruling was abrogated. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Sulayman bin Buraydah said that his father said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet used to perform <b>Wudu</b> before every prayer. On the Day of Victory, he performed <b>Wudu</b> and wiped on his <b>Khuffs</b> and prayed the five prayers with one <b>Wudu</b>. <br /> <br />Umar said to him, `O Messenger of Allah! You did something new that you never did before.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />إني عمدا فعلته يا عمر <br /> <br />`I did that intentionally O Umar!&#34;' <br /> <br />Muslim and the collectors of the <b>Sunan</b> also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Fadl bin Al-Mubashshir said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Jabir bin Abdullah perform several prayers with only one <b>Wudu</b>. When he would answer the call of nature, he performed <b>Wudu</b> and wiped the top of his <b>Khuffs</b> with his wet hand. I said, `O Abu Abdullah! Do you do this according to your own opinion?' <br /> <br />He said, `Rather, I saw the Prophet do the same thing. So, I do what I saw the Messenger of Allah doing.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Majah also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded that; <br /> <br />Ubaydullah bin Abdullah bin Umar was asked; &#34;Did you see Abdullah bin Umar perform <b>Wudu</b> for every prayer, whether he was in a state of purity or not,&#34; <br /> <br />So he replied, &#34;Asma bint Zayd bin Al-Khattab told him that Abdullah bin Hanzalah bin Abi `Amir Al-Ghasil told her that the Messenger of Allah was earlier commanded to perform <b>Wudu</b> for every prayer, whether he needed it or not. When that became hard on him, he was commanded to use <b>Siwak</b> for every prayer, and to perform <b>Wudu</b> when <b>Hadath</b> (impurity) occurs. Abdullah (Ibn Umar) thought that he was able to do that (perform <b>Wudu</b> for every prayer) and he kept doing that until he died.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud also collected this narration. <br /> <br />This practice by Ibn Umar demonstrates that it is encouraged, not obligatory, to perform <b>Wudu</b> for every prayer, and this is also the opinion of the majority of scholars. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Abbas said that when the Messenger of Allah once left the area where he answered the call of nature, he was brought something to eat. They said, &#34;Should we bring you your water for <b>Wudu</b>?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />إنَّمَا أُمِرْتُ بِالْوُضُوءِ إِذَا قُمْتُ إِلَى الصَّلَة <br /> <br />I was commanded to perform <b>Wudu</b> when I stand up for prayer. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this <b>Hadith</b> and At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were with the Prophet when he went to answer the call of nature and when he came back, he was brought some food. He was asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Do you want to perform <b>Wudu</b>?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />لِمَ <br /> <br /> <br />أَأُصَلِي فَأَتَوَضَّأ <br /> <br />`Why? Am I about to pray so that I have to make <b>Wudu</b>.&#34;' <br /><b>The Intention and Mentioning Allah's Name for Wudu</b> <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ <br /> <br />then wash your faces..., <br /> <br />The obligation for the intention before <b>Wudu</b> is proven by this <b>Ayah</b>; <b> <br />إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ <br /></b> (When you stand (intend) to offer the Salah then wash your faces...). This is because it is just like the Arabs saying; &#34;When you see the leader, then stand.&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning stand for him. <br /> <br />And the Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded the <b>Hadith</b>, <br /> <br />الاَْعْمَالُ بِالنِّــيَّاتِ وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مَانَوَى <br /> <br />Actions are judged by their intentions, and each person will earn what he intended. <br /> <br />It is also recommended before washing the face that one mentions Allah's Name for the <b>Wudu</b>. <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> that was narrated by several Companions states that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا وُضْوءَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ اسْمَ اللهِ عَلَيْه <br /> <br />There is no <b>Wudu</b> for he who does not mention Allah's Name over it. <br /> <br />It is also recommended that one washes his hands before he puts his hands in the vessel of water, especially after one wakes up from sleep, for the Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا اسْتَيْقَظَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ فَلَ يُدْخِلْ يَدَهُ فِي الاِْنَاءِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَغْسِلَهَا ثَلَثًا فَإِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ لَا يَدْرِي أَيْنَ بَاتَتْ يَدُه <br /> <br />If one of you wakes up from his sleep, let him not put his hand in the pot until he washes it thrice, for one of you does not know where his hand spent the night. <br /> <br />The face according to the scholars of <b>Fiqh</b> starts where the hair line on the head starts, regardless of one's lack or abundance of hair, until the end of the cheeks and chin, and from ear to ear. <br /><b>Passing the Fingers through the Beard While Performing Wudu</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Wa'il said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Uthman when he was performing <b>Wudu</b>... When he washed his face, he passed his fingers through his beard three times. He said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah do what you saw me doing.&#34;' <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; while Al-Bukhari graded it <b>Hasan</b>. <br /><b>How to Perform Wudu</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas once performed <b>Wudu</b> and took a handful of water and rinsed his mouth and nose with it. He took another handful of water and joined both hands and washed his face. He took another handful of water and washed his right hand, and another handful and washed his left hand with it. He next wiped his head. Next, he took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his right foot and washed it and took another handful of water and washed his left foot. When he finished, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is how I saw the Messenger of Allah (performing <b>Wudu</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded it. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ <br /> <br />and your hands (forearms) up to (<b>Ila</b>) the elbows..., <br /> <br />meaning, including the elbows. <br /> <br />Allah said in another Ayah (using <b>Ila</b>) <br /> <br />وَلَا تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَى أَمْوَالِكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوبًا كَبِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br />And devour not their substance to (<b>Ila</b>) your substance (by adding or including it in your property). Surely, this is a great sin. (4&#59;2) <br /> <br />It is recommended that those who perform <b>Wudu</b> should wash a part of the upper arm with the elbow. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ أُمَّتِي يُدْعَوْنَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ غُرًّا مُحَجَّلِينَ مِنْ اثَارِ الْوُضُوءِ فَمَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمْ أَنْ يُطِيلَ غُرَّتَهُ فَلْيَفْعَل <br /> <br />On the Day of Resurrection, my <b>Ummah</b> will be called &#34;those with the radiant appendages&#34; because of the traces of <b>Wudu</b>. Therefore, whoever can increase the area of his radiance should do so. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard my intimate friend (the Messenger) saying, <br /> <br />تَبْلُغُ الْحِلْيَةُ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِ حَيْثُ يَبْلُغُ الْوَضُوء <br /> <br />The radiance of the believer reaches the areas that the water of (his) <b>Wudu</b> reaches.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَامْسَحُواْ بِرُوُوسِكُمْ <br /> <br />Rub your heads. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that; <br /> <br />Malik bin `Amr bin Yahya Al-Mazini said that his father said that a man said to Abdullah bin Zayd bin Asim, the grandfather of `Amr bin Yahya and one of the Companions of the Messenger, <br /> <br />&#34;Can you show me how the Messenger of Allah used to perform <b>Wudu</b>?&#34;' <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Zayd said, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />He then asked for a pot of water. He poured from it on his hands and washed them twice, then he rinsed his mouth and washed his nose (with water) thrice (by putting water in it and blowing it out). He washed his face thrice and after that he washed his forearms up to the elbows twice. He then passed his wet hands over his head from its front to its back and vice versa, beginning from the front and taking them to the back of his head up to the nape of the neck and then brought them to the front again from where he had started. He next washed his feet. <br /> <br />A similar description of the <b>Wudu</b> of the Messenger of Allah was performed by Ali in the <b>Hadith</b> by Abdu Khayr. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that; <br /> <br />Mu`awiyah and Al-Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib narrated similar descriptions of the <b>Wudu</b> of the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />These <b>Hadiths</b> indicate that it is necessary to wipe the entire head. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Humran bin Aban said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw Uthman bin Affan performing <b>Wudu</b>, and he poured water over his hands and washed them thrice, and then rinsed his mouth and washed his nose (by putting water in it, and then blowing it out). Then he washed his face thrice, and then his right forearm up to the elbows thrice, and washed the left forearm thrice. Then he passed his wet hands over his head, then he washed his right foot thrice, and next his left foot thrice. After that Uthman said, `I saw the Prophet performing <b>Wudu</b> like this, and said, <br /> <br />مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ نَحْوَ وُضُويِي هَذَا ثُمَّ صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ لَا يُحَدِّثُ فِيهِمَا نَفْسَهُ غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه <br /> <br />If anyone performs <b>Wudu</b> like that of mine and offers a two-<b>Rak`ah</b> prayer during which he does not think of anything else, then his past sins will be forgiven.&#34;' <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this <b>Hadith</b> in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />In his <b>Sunan</b>, Abu Dawud also recorded it from Uthman, under the description of <b>Wudu</b>, and in it, that he wiped his head one time. <br /><b>The Necessity of Washing the Feet</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَينِ <br /> <br />and your feet up to ankles. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas stated that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to washing (the feet). <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Urwah, Ata, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Ibrahim, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Az-Zuhri and Ibrahim At-Taymi said similarly. <br /> <br />This clearly indicates the necessity of washing the feet, just as the <b>Salaf</b> have said, and not only wiping over the top of the bare foot. <br /><b>The Hadiths that Indicate the Necessity of Washing the Feet</b> <br /> <br />We mentioned the <b>Hadiths</b> by the two Leaders of the Faithful, Uthman and Ali, and also by Ibn Abbas, Mu`awiyah, Abdullah bin Zayd bin Asim and Al-Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib, that the Messenger of Allah washed his feet for <b>Wudu</b>, either once, twice or thrice. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abdullah bin `Amr said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah was once late during a trip we were taking, and he caught up with us when the time remaining for the <b>Asr</b> prayer was short. We were still performing <b>Wudu</b> (in a rush) and we were wiping our feet. He shouted at the top of his voice, <br /> <br />أَسْبِغُوا الْوُضُوءَ وَيْلٌ لِلَْعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّار <br /> <br />Perform <b>Wudu</b> thoroughly. Save your heels from the Fire.&#34; <br /> <br />The same narration was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> from Abu Hurayrah. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Aishah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />أَسْبِغُوا الْوُضُوءَ وَيْلٌ لِلَْعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّار <br /> <br />Perform <b>Wudu</b> thoroughly. Save your heels from the Fire. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Jaz said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying, <br /> <br />وَيْلٌ لِلَْعْقَابِ وَبُطُونِ الاَْقْدَامِ مِنَ النَّار <br /> <br />Save your heels and the bottom of the feet from the Fire. <br /> <br />It was recorded by Al-Bayhaqi and Al-Hakim, and this chain is <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Umar bin Al-Khattab said that; <br /> <br />a man once performed <b>Wudu</b> and left a dry spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. The Prophet saw that and he said to him, <br /> <br />ارْجِعْ فَأَحْسِنْ وُضُوءَك <br /> <br />Go back and perform proper <b>Wudu</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi also recorded that; <br /> <br />Anas bin Malik said that a man came to the Prophet, after he performed Wudu' and left a dry spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. The Messenger of Allah said to him, <br /> <br />ارْجِعْ فَأَحْسِنْ وُضُوءَك <br /> <br />Go back and perform proper <b>Wudu</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that some of the wives of the Prophet said that; <br /> <br />the Prophet saw a man praying, but noticed a dry spot on his foot, the size of a Dirham. The Messenger of Allah ordered that man to perform <b>Wudu</b> again. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected by Abu Dawud from Baqiyyah, who added in his narration, <br /> <br />&#34;And (the Prophet ordered him) to repeat the prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has a strong, reasonably good chain of narrators. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /><b>The Necessity of Washing Between the Fingers</b> <br /> <br />In the <b>Hadith</b> that Humran narrated, <br /> <br />Uthman washed between his fingers when he was describing the <b>Wudu</b> of the Prophet. <br /> <br />The collectors of the Sunan recorded that Laqit bin Sabrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Tell me about <b>Wudu</b>.' <br /> <br />The Messenger replied, <br /> <br />أَسْبِغِ الْوُضُوءَ وَخَلِّلْ بَيْنَ الاَْصَابِعِ وَبَالِغْ فِي الاِسْتِنْشَاقِ إِلاَّ أَنْ تَكُونَ صَايِمًا <br /> <br />Perform <b>Wudu</b> thoroughly, wash between the fingers and exaggerate in rinsing your nose, unless you are fasting.&#34; <br /><b>Wiping Over the Khuffs is an Established Sunnah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Aws bin Abi Aws said, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw the Messenger of Allah perform <b>Wudu</b> and wipe over his <b>Khuffs</b>. He then stood up for prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded this <b>Hadith</b> by Aws bin Abi Aws, who said in this narration, <br /> <br />&#34;I saw the Messenger of Allah, after he answered the call of nature, perform <b>Wudu</b> and wipe over his <b>Khuffs</b> and feet.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali said, <br /> <br />&#34;I embraced Islam after Surah <b>Al-Ma'idah</b> was revealed and I saw the Messenger of Allah wipe over his <b>Khuffs</b> after I became Muslim.&#34; <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Hammam said, <br /> <br />&#34;Jarir answered the call of nature and then performed <b>Wudu</b> and wiped over his <b>Khuffs</b>. <br /> <br />He was asked, `Do you do this?' <br /> <br />He said, `Yes. I saw the Messenger of Allah, after he answered the call of nature, perform <b>Wudu</b> and wipe on his <b>Khuffs</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Al-Amash commented that Ibrahim said, <br /> <br />&#34;They liked this <b>Hadith</b> because Jarir embraced Islam after Surah <b>Al-Ma'idah</b> was revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording collected by Muslim. <br /> <br />The subject of the Messenger of Allah wiping over his <b>Khuffs</b>, instead of washing the feet, if he had worn his <b>Khuffs</b> while having <b>Wudu</b>, reaches the <b>Mutawatir</b> grade of narration, and they describe this practice by his words and actions. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنتُمْ جُنُبًا فَاطَّهَّرُواْ <br /> <br />If you are in a state of <b>Janaba</b>, purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). <br /><b>Performing Tayammum with Clean earth When There is no Water and When One is Ill</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاء أَحَدٌ مَّنكُم مِّنَ الْغَايِطِ أَوْ لَامَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَاء فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُم مِّنْهُ <br /> <br />But if you are ill or on a journey or any of you come from the <b>Gha'it</b> (toilet), or you have touched women and you find no water, then perform <b>Tayammum</b> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. <br /> <br />We discussed all of this in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b>, and thus we do not need to repeat it here. <br /> <br />We also mentioned the reason behind revealing this <b>Ayah</b>. Yet, Al-Bukhari mentioned an honorable <b>Hadith</b> here specifically about the Tafsir of this noble <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />He recorded that Aishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Upon returning to Al-Madinah, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost) in Al-Bayda' area. Allah's Messenger stayed there and went to sleep with his head on my lap. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr (Aishah's father) came and hit me on my flank with his hand saying, `You have detained the people because of a necklace!' So I wished I were dead because (I could not move) the Messenger was sleeping on my lap and because of the pain Abu Bakr caused me. <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed, <b> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلةِ فاغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ <br /></b> (O you who believe! When you stand (intend) to offer <b>As-Salah</b> (the prayer), then wash your faces) until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Usayd bin Al-Hudayr said, `O the family of Abu Bakr! Allah has blessed the people because of you. Therefore, you are only a blessing for the people.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />مَا يُرِيدُ اللّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ <br /> <br />Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, <br /> <br />This is why He made things easy and lenient for you. This is why He allowed you to use <b>Tayammum</b> when you are ill and when you do not find water, to make things comfortable for you and as mercy for you. Allah made <b>Tayammum</b> in place of <b>Wudu</b>, and Allah made it the same as ablution with water for the one who it is legitimate for, except for certain things, as we mentioned before. For example; <b>Tayammum</b> only involves one strike with the hand on the sand and wiping the face and hands. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهَّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but He wants to purify you, and to complete His favor on you that you may be thankful. <br /> <br />for His bounties on you, such as His easy, kind, merciful, comfortable and lenient legislation. <br /><b>Supplicating to Allah after Wudu</b> <br /> <br />The <b>Sunnah</b> encourages supplicating to Allah after <b>Wudu</b> and states that those who do so are among those who seek to purify themselves, as the <b>Ayah</b> above states. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad, Muslim and the collectors of <b>Sunan</b> narrated that Uqbah bin `Amir said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were on watch, guarding camels, and when my turn to guard came, I took the camels back at night. I found that the Messenger of Allah was giving a speech to the people. I heard these words from that speech&#59; <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُحْسِنُ وُضُوءهُ ثُمَّ يَقُومُ فَيُصَلِّي رَكْعَتَيْنِ مُقْبلًا عَلَيْهِمَا بِقَلْبِهِ وَوَجْهِهِ إِلاَّ وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّة <br /> <br />Any Muslim who performs <b>Wudu</b> properly, then stands up and prays a two <b>Rak`ah</b> prayer with full attention in his heart and face, will earn Paradise. <br /> <br />I said, `What a good statement this is!' <br /> <br />A person who was close by said, `The statement he said before it is even better.' <br /> <br />When I looked, I found that it was Umar, who said, `I saw that you just came. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُبْلِغُ أَوْفَيُسْبِغُ الْوُضُوءَ يَقُولُ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَاا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلاَّ فُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةِ يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاء <br /> <br />When any of you performs <b>Wudu</b> properly and says, `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger', the eight doors of Paradise will be opened for him so that he can enter from any door he wishes.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the wording collected by Muslim. <br /><b>The Virtue of Wudu</b> <br /> <br />Malik recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِذَا تَوَضَّأَ الْعَبْدُ الْمُسْلِمُ أَوِ الْمُوْمِنُ فَغَسَلَ وَجْهَهُ خَرَجَ مِنْ وَجْهِهِ كُلُّ خَطِييَةٍ نَظَرَ إِلَيْهَا بِعَيْنَيْهِ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ اخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ فَإِذَا غَسَلَ يَدَيهِ خَرَجَ مِنْ يَدَيْهِ كُلُّ خَطِييَةٍ بَطَشَتْهَا يَدَاهُ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ اخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ فَإِذَا غَسَلَ رِجْلَيْهِ خَرَجَتْ كُلُّ خَطِييةٍ مَشَتْهَا رِجْلَهُ مَعَ الْمَاءِ أَوْ مَعَ اخِرِ قَطْرِ الْمَاءِ حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ نَقِيًّا مِنَ الذُّنُوب <br /> <br />When the Muslim or the believing servant performs <b>Wudu</b> and washes his face, every sin that he looked at with his eyes will depart from his face with the water, or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed will depart from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water. When he washes his feet, every sin to which his feet took him will depart with the water, or with the last drop of water. Until, he ends up sinless. <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded it. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ashari said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الطُّهُور شَطْرُ الاِْيمَانِ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ تَمْلَُ الْمِيزَانَ وَسُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ تَمْلَُ مَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالاَْرْضِ <br /> <br />وَالصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ وَالصَّبْرُ ضِيَاءٌ وَالصدَقَةُ بُرْهَانٌ وَالقُرْانُ حُجَّةٌ لَكَ أَوْ عَلَيْكَ كُلُّ النَّاسِ يَغْدُو فَبَايِعٌ نَفْسَهُ فَمُعْتِقُهَا أَوْ مُوبِقُهَا <br /> <br />Purity is half of faith and <b>Al-Hamdu Lillah</b> (all the thanks are due to Allah) fills the <b>Mizan</b> (the Scale). And <b>Subhan Allah</b> and <b>Allahu Akbar</b> (all praise is due to Allah, and Allah is the Most Great) fills what is between the heaven and earth. <br /><b>As-Sawm</b> (the fast) is a <b>Junnah</b> (a shield), <b>Sabr</b> (patience) is a light, <b>Sadaqah</b> (charity) is evidence (of faith) and the Qur'an is proof for, or against you. <br /> <br />Every person goes out in the morning and ends up selling himself, he either frees his soul or destroys it. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا يَقْبَلُ اللهُ صَدَقَةً مِنْ غُلُولٍ وَلَاا صَلَاةً بِغَيْرِ طُهُور <br /> <br />Allah does not accept charity from one who commits <b>Ghulul</b>, or prayer without purity</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 5" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 7" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=6;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
