Some of them, a group [among them], are a just community, implementing it [the Torah], and they are the ones who believed in the Prophet (s), the likes of `Abd Allh b.

These Books testify to the Prophet's truth and command that he must be followed. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />لاأكَلُواْ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم <br /></b> (they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet), <br /> <br />refers to the tremendous provision that would have descended to them from the sky and grown for them on the earth. Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَى ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّقَوْاْ لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَـتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَأءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ <br /> <br />And if the people of the towns had believed and had <b>Taqwa</b>, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth. (7&#59;96) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِّنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُّقْتَصِدَةٌ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ سَاء مَا يَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And among them is a <b>Muqtasid</b> <b>Ummah</b>, but for most of them; evil is their work. <br /> <br />is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ <br /> <br />And of the people of Musa there is a community who lead (the men) with truth and establish justice therewith. (7&#59;159) <br /> <br />and His statement about the followers of `Isa, peace be upon him, <br /> <br />فَـَاتَيْنَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ <br /> <br />So We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward. (57&#59;67) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah gave them the highest grade of <b>Iqtisad</b>, which is the middle course, given to this <b>Ummah</b>. Above them there is the grade of <b>Sabiqun</b>, as Allah described in His statement; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ <br /> <br />جَنَّـتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُوْلُواً وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ <br /> <br />Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who, by Allah's permission, are <b>Sabiq</b> (foremost) in good deeds. That itself is indeed a great grace. <b>`Adn</b> (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) will they enter, therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments there will be of silk.
