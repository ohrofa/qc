They strive in the way of God, and do not fear the blame of the critic. That is the grace of God; He bestows it upon whomever He wills. God is Embracing and Knowing.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>O you who believe, whoever of you apostatises (read either yartadid, with separation [of the two dl letters], or yartadd, with assimilation [of one of the dl letters with the other]), turns back, from his religion, to disbelief -- this is a notification of what God knew would happen, for some of them apostatised upon the death of the Prophet (s) -- God will assuredly bring, in their place, a people whom He loves and who love Him&#59; the Prophet (s) said, `They are people like him', and he pointed to Ab Ms al-Ash`ar, as reported by al-Hkim [al-Naysbr] in his Sahh; humble, sympathetic, towards believers, stern, severe, towards disbelievers, struggling in the way of God, and fearing not the reproach of any reproacher, therein, in the way that the hypocrites fear the reproach of the disbelievers. That, description mentioned, is God's bounty; He gives it to whom He will; and God is Embracing, of abundant bounty, Knowing, of those who deserve it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Threatening to Replace the Believers With Another People if They Revert from Islam</b> <br /> <br />Allah emphasizes His mighty ability and states that whoever reverts from supporting His religion and establishing His Law, then Allah will replace them with whomever is better, mightier and more righteous in Allah's religion and Law. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْاْ يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُونُواْ أَمْثَـلَكُم <br /> <br />And if you turn away, He will exchange you for some other people and they will not be your likes. (47&#59;38) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالَارْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ <br /> <br /> <br />وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ <br /> <br /> <br />Do you not see that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth If He will, He can remove you and bring (in your place) a new creation! And for Allah that is not hard or difficult. (14&#59;19-20) <br /> <br />Verily this is not difficult or hard on Allah. <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ مَن يَرْتَدَّ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion..., <br /> <br />and turns back from the truth to falsehood, from now until the commencement of the Last Hour. <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِي اللّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ <br /> <br />Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ <br /> <br />humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers. <br /> <br />These are the qualities of perfect believers, as they are humble with their believing brothers and allies, stern with their enemies and adversaries. In another Ayah, Allah said, <br /> <br />مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَأءُ بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. (48;29) <br /> <br />The Prophet is described as the smiling fighter, smiling to his allies and fighting his enemies. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لايِمٍ <br /> <br />Fighting in the way of Allah, and never fearing the blame of the blamers. <br /> <br />Nothing prevents them from obeying Allah, establishing His Law, fighting His enemies, enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Certainly, nothing prevents them from taking this path, neither someone who seeks to hinder them, nor one who blames or chastises them. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, <br /> <br />&#34;My Khalil (intimate friend, the Messenger) has commanded me to do seven deeds. <br /> <br />He commanded me to love the poor and to be close to them. <br /> <br />He commanded me to look at those who are less than me and not those who are above me. <br /> <br />He commanded me to keep the relations of the womb, even if they cut it. <br /> <br />He commanded me not to ask anyone for anything, <br /> <br />to say the truth even if it was bitter, and <br /> <br />to not fear the blame of anyone for the sake of Allah. <br /> <br />He commanded me to often repeat, <b>La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah</b> (There is no strength or power except from Allah)', for these words are from a treasure under the Throne (of Allah).&#34; <br /> <br />It is confirmed in the <b>Sahih</b>; <br /> <br />مَا يَنْبَغِي لِلْمُوْمِنِ أَنْ يُذِلَّ نَفْسَه <br /> <br />The believer is not required to humiliate himself. <br /> <br />He was asked; &#34;How does one humiliate himself, O Messenger of Allah?&#34; <br /> <br />So he replied; <br /> <br />يَتَحَمَّلُ مِنَ الْبَلَءِ مَا لَا يُطِيق <br /> <br />He takes on tests that he cannot bear. <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللّهِ يُوْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills. <br /> <br />meaning, those who have these qualities, acquired it by Allah's bounty and favor and because He granted them these qualities. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower. <br /> <br />His favor is ever extending, and He has perfect knowledge of those who deserve or do not deserve His favor and bounty. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 53" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-53/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">54</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>54</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 55" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-55/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=54;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
