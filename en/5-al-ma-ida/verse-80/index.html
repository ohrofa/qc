Evil indeed is what they themselves send ahead for themselves (for their future and for the life hereafter), so that God will condemn them, and they will abide in the punishment.</p></div><div id="amatul-rahman-omar"><h3>Amatul Rahman Omar</h3><p>You will find many of them allying (themselves) with those who disbelieve.

This evil act caused them to have hypocrisy in their hearts and brought them the anger of Allah, that will remain with them until the Day of Return. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />أَن سَخِطَ اللّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />for that (reason) Allah is wrath with them. <br /> <br />because of what they did. <br /> <br />Allah next said that, <br /> <br />وَفِي الْعَذَابِ هُمْ خَالِدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in torment they will abide. <br /> <br />on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 79" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">80</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>80</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 81" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-81/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
