Then they returned to An-Najashi and told him what happened. <br /> <br />Ata bin Abi Rabah commented, <br /> <br />&#34;They were Ethiopians who embraced Islam when the Muslims who migrated to Ethiopia resided among them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;They were some followers of the religion of `Isa, son of Maryam, who when they saw Muslims and heard the Qur'an, they became Muslims without hesitation.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said that; <br /> <br />these <b>Ayat</b> were revealed concerning some people who fit this description, whether they were from Ethiopia or otherwise. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ النَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ امَنُواْ الْيَهُودَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ <br /> <br />Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers the Jews and those who commit <b>Shirk</b>, <br /> <br />This describes the Jews, since their disbelief is that of rebellion, defiance, opposing the truth, belittling other, people and degrading the scholars. This is why the Jews - may Allah's continued curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection - killed many of their Prophets and tried to kill the Messenger of Allah several times, as well as, performing magic spells against him and poisoning him. They also incited their likes among the polytheists against the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ امَنُواْ الَّذِينَ قَالُوَاْ إِنَّا نَصَارَى <br /> <br />and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say&#59;&#34;We are Christians.&#34; <br /> <br />refers to those who call themselves Christians, who follow the religion of the <b>Messiah</b> and the teachings of his <b>Injil</b>. These people are generally more tolerant of Islam and its people, because of the mercy and kindness that their hearts acquired through part of the <b>Messiah's</b> religion. In another Ayah, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا فِى قُلُوبِ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ رَأْفَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً <br /> <br />And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion, mercy, and monasticism... (57&#59;27) <br /> <br />In their book is the saying; &#34;He who strikes you on the right cheek, then turn the left cheek for him.&#34; <br /> <br />And fighting was prohibited in their creed, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا وَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That is because among them are <b>Qissisin</b> (priests) and <b>Ruhban</b> (monks), and they are not proud. <br /> <br />This means that among them are <b>Qissisin</b> (priests). <br /> <br />The word <b>Ruhban</b> refers to one dedicated to worship. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَانًا وَأَنَّهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ <br /> <br />That is because among them are priests and monks, and they are not proud. <br /> <br />This describes them with knowledge, worship and humbleness, along with following the truth and fairness</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 81" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-81/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">82</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>82</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 83" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-83/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
