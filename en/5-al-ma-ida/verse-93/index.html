(5&#59;93) until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَوْ حُرِّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَتَرَكُوهُ كَمَا تَرَكْتُم <br /> <br />Had they been made impermissible for them, they would have abandoned them as you have abandoned them. <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah! Explain the verdict about <b>Khamr</b> to us clearly.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ قُلْ فِيهِمَأ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ <br /> <br />They ask you about alcoholic drink and gambling. <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;In them is a great sin.&#34; (2&#59;219) <br /> <br />Umar was summoned and this <b>Ayah</b> was recited to him, but he still said, &#34;O Allah! Make the verdict of <b>Khamr</b> clear to us.&#34; <br /> <br />Then the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تَقْرَبُواْ الصَّلَوةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَـرَى <br /> <br />O you who believe! Do not approach the <b>Salah</b> when you are in a drunken state. (4&#59;43) <br /> <br />Thereafter, the Prophet had someone herald when it was time to pray, &#34;Those in a drunken state are not to approach the prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar was again summoned and the <b>Ayah</b> was recited to him, but he still said, &#34;O Allah! Make the verdict concerning <b>Khamr</b> clear to us.&#34; <br /> <br />Then, the <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>Al-Ma'idah</b> (5&#59;91) was revealed, and Umar was summoned and it was recited to him. <br /> <br />When he reached the part of the <b>Ayah</b> that reads, <br />فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّنتَهُونَ <br /> (So, will you not then abstain). ( 5&#59;91) Umar said, &#34;We abstained, we abstained.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi graded it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, that Umar bin Al-Khattab said in a speech; while standing on the <b>Minbar</b> of the Messenger of Allah (in the Prophet's <b>Masjid</b> in Al-Madinah), <br /> <br />&#34;O people! The prohibition of <b>Khamr</b> was revealed; and <b>Khamr</b> was extracted from five things&#59;From grapes, dates, honey, wheat and barley. <b>Khamr</b> is what intoxicates the mind.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Umar said, &#34;The prohibition of Khamr was revealed when there were five kinds of intoxicants in Al-Madinah, besides what was produced from grapes.&#34; <br /><b>Another Hadith</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said, <br /> <br />&#34;I once was giving an alcoholic beverage to Abu Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Suhayl bin Bayda' and several of their friends meeting at Abu Talhah's house. When they were almost intoxicated, some Muslims came and said, `Did you not know that <b>Khamr</b> has been prohibited?' <br /> <br />They said, `We'll wait and ask.' They then said, `O Anas! Spill the remaining alcohol out of your container.' <br /> <br />By Allah! They never drank it again, and their <b>Khamr</b> at that time was made from unripe and normal dates.&#34;' <br /> <br />This is also recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />In another narration by Anas, <br /> <br />&#34;I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talhah when <b>Khamr</b> was prohibited, and in those days alcohol was made from unripe and normal dates. A caller then heralded, and Abu Talhah ordered me to see what it was about. So I found that a person was announcing that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talhah ordered me to go out and spill the wine. <br /> <br />I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets of Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />Some people said, `Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs.' Later on, Allah's revelation came, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُواْ <br /> <br />Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate... (5&#59;93)&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was serving Abu Talhah, Abu Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah, Abu Dujanah, Mu`adh bin Jabal and Suhayl bin Bayda, until they became intoxicated from an alcoholic drink made of mixed unripe and normal dates. Then I heard someone herald, <b>`Khamr</b> has been made illegal.' So no one went in or out until we spilled the alcohol and broke its barrels. Some of us then performed ablution and others took a shower, and we wore some perfume. We then went out to the <b>Masjid</b> while the Messenger of Allah was reciting, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالَانصَابُ وَالَازْلَامُ <br /> <br />رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ <br /> <br /> <br />O you who believe! Khamr, Maysir, Ansab, and Azlam are only an abomination of Shaytan's handiwork. So avoid that...), (5&#59;90), until, <br />فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّنتَهُونَ <br /> (So, will you not then abstain). (5&#59;91) <br /> <br />A man asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What about those who died drinking it?' Allah sent down the verse, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُواْ <br /> <br />Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate. (5&#59;93)&#34; <br /><b>Another Hadith</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لُعِنَتِ الْخَمْرُ عَلى عَشْرَةِ أَوْجُهٍ <br /> <br />لُعِنَتِ الْخَمْرُ بِعَيْنِهَا <br /> <br />وَشَارِبُهَا <br /> <br />وَسَاقِيهَا <br /> <br />وَبَايِعُهَا <br /> <br />وَمُبْتَاعُهَا <br /> <br />وَعَاصِرُهَا <br /> <br />وَمُعْتَصِرُهَا <br /> <br />وَحَامِلُها <br /> <br />وَالْمَحْمُولَةُ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br />وَاكِلُ ثَمَنِهَا <br /> <br />Ten matters related to <b>Khamr</b> were cursed. <br /><b>Khamr</b> itself was cursed, <br /> <br />whoever drinks it, <br /> <br />its server, <br /> <br />seller, <br /> <br />buyer, <br /> <br />brewer, <br /> <br />who asks for it to be brewed, <br /> <br />whoever carries it, <br /> <br />whomever it is carried to and <br /> <br />whoever consumes its price. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;Once, the Messenger of Allah went out and I went out with him. I walked to his right, but Abu Bakr came along and I gave way to him, and Abu Bakr was walking on the Prophet's right, while I was walking on his left. Then Umar came along and he was walking on the Prophet's left, since I gave way to him. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah then found a leather skin hanging containing alcohol, so he asked for a knife and ordered that the skin be cut open. He then said, <br /> <br />لُعِنَتِ الْخَمْرُ وَشَارِبُهَا وَسَاقِيهَا وَبَايِعُهَا وَمُبْتَاعُهَا وَحَامِلُهَا وَالْمَحْمُولَةُ إِلَيْهِ وَعَاصِرُهَا وَمُعْتَصِرُهَا وَاكِلُ ثَمَنِهَا <br /><b>Khamr</b> was cursed, and so are those who drink it, serve it, sell it, buy it, carry it, have it carried to them, brew it, have it brewed and consume its price.&#34; <br /><b>Another Hadith</b> <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Sa`d said, <br /> <br />&#34;There were four <b>Ayat</b> revealed about <b>Khamr</b>...&#34; <br /> <br />He then said, &#34;A man from Al-Ansar made some food and invited us. We drank <b>Khamr</b> before it was prohibited and became intoxicated, and thus started to boast about our status. The Ansar said that they were better, while Quraysh (the Muhajirin) said that they were better. So a man from the Ansar took a bone and struck Sa`d's nose with it and made a flesh wound on it. Ever since that happened, Sa`d's nose had a scar from that wound. The <b>Ayah</b>, <br />إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ <br /> (Intoxicants, gambling,) until, <br />فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّنتَهُونَ <br /> (So, will you not then abstain) was later revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /><b>Another Hadith</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> in the Qur'an, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالَانصَا <br />بُ وَالَازْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ <br /> <br />فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />O you who believe! <b>Khamr</b>, <b>Maysir</b>, <b>Ansab</b>, and <b>Azlam</b> are only an abomination of <b>Shaytan's</b> handiwork. So avoid that in order that you may be successful. (5&#59;90) <br /> <br />was also in the <b>Tawrah</b>; <br /> <br />`Allah has sent down truth to eradicate falsehood, joyful play, flute or wind instruments, <b>Zafan</b> (dances) and <b>Kibarat</b> (referring to cabarets using the lute and bagpipe), tambourine, guitar, harp and lyric and love poetry. And <b>Khamr</b> is bitter for those who taste it. Allah has vowed by His grace and power, `Whoever drinks it after I prohibited it, I will make him thirsty on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever abandons it after I prohibited it, I will let him taste it in the residence of Grace (Paradise).&#34;' <br /> <br />Its chain of narration is <b>Sahih</b> <br /><b>Another Hadith</b> <br /> <br />Ash-Shafii narrated that Malik narrated that Nafi` said that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ شَرِبَ الْخَمْرَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُبْ مِنْهَا حُرِمَهَا فِي الاخِرَة <br /> <br />Whoever drinks <b>Khamr</b> in the life of this world and does not repent from it, will be deprived of it in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُّ مُسْكِرٍ خَمْرٌ وَكُلُّ مُسْكِرٍ حَرَامٌ <br /> <br />وَمَنْ شَرِبَ الْخَمْرَ فَمَاتَ وَهُوَ يُدْمِنُهَا وَلَمْ يَتُبْ مِنْهَا لَمْ يَشْرَبْهَا فِي الاْخِرَة <br /> <br />Every intoxicant is <b>Khamr</b>, and every intoxicant is unlawful. <br /> <br />Whoever drinks <b>Khamr</b> and dies while addicted to it, without repenting from drinking it, will not drink it in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham said that he heard Uthman bin Affan saying, <br /> <br />&#34;Avoid <b>Khamr</b>, for it is the mother of all sins. <br /> <br />There was a man before your time who used to worship Allah secluded from the people. Later, an evil woman loved him and sent her female servant to him saying that they wanted him to witness something. So he went with the servant. Whenever they went through the door, she locked it behind them, until he reached a beautiful woman with a young servant boy and some alcohol. She said to him, `By Allah! I did not invite you to be a witness for anything, but called you to have sex with me, kill this boy or drink this alcohol.' <br /> <br />So she gave him some alcohol, and he kept asking for more until he (became intoxicated and) had sex with her and killed the boy. <br /> <br />Therefore, avoid <b>Khamr</b>, because it is never combined with faith, but one of them is bound to expel the other (from the heart).&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bayhaqi. <br /> <br />This statement has an authentic chain of narration. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr bin Abi Ad-Dunya recorded this statement in his book on the prohibition of intoxicants, but he related it from the Prophet. <br /> <br />Relating it from Uthman is more authentic, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When <b>Khamr</b> was prohibited, some people said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about our brethren who died while still drinking <b>Khamr</b>?' <br /> <br />Allah sent down the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُواْ <br /> (Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate), until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />When the <b>Qiblah</b> (direction of the prayer) was changed (from Jerusalem to Makkah), some people asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What about our brethren who died while still praying toward Jerusalem' <br /> <br />Allah sent down, <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ <br /> <br />And Allah would never make your faith to be lost.&#34; (2&#59;143) <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />when the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُواْ إِذَا مَا اتَّقَواْ وَّامَنُواْ <br /> (Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate, if they have <b>Taqwa</b>, and believe...) was revealed, <br /> <br />قِيلَ لِي أَنْتَ مِنْهُم <br /> <br />I was told, that you are among them. <br /> <br />This is the narration that Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected. <br /> <br />إِذَا مَا اتَّقَواْ وَّامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَّامَنُواْ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَّأَحْسَنُواْ وَاللّهُ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />if they have <b>Taqwa</b> and believe and do righteous good deeds, and they (again) have <b>Taqwa</b> and believe, and then (once again) have <b>Taqwa</b> and perform good. And Allah loves the good-doers</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 92" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">93</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>93</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 94" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-94/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
