God, exalted be He, says&#59; But it may be that God will bring victory, by assisting His Prophet and making His religion prevail; or some commandment from Him, that will reveal the secrets of the hypocrites, disgracing them; and then they will end up, for what they kept secret within themselves, in the way of doubt and affiliating with disbelievers, remorseful.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَتَرَى الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ <br /> <br />And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease..., <br /> <br />A disease of doubt, hesitation and hypocrisy. <br /> <br />يُسَارِعُونَ فِيهِمْ <br /> <br />they hurry to their friendship, <br /> <br />meaning, they rush to offer them their friendship and allegiances in secret and in public. <br /> <br />يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَى أَن تُصِيبَنَا دَايِرَةٌ <br /> <br />saying&#59;&#34;We fear lest some misfortune of a disaster may befall us.&#34; <br /> <br />They thus offer this excuse for their friendship and allegiances to the disbelievers, saying that they fear that the disbelievers might defeat the Muslims, so they want to be in favor with the Jews and Christians, to use this favor for their benefit in that eventuality! <br /> <br />Allah replied, <br /> <br />فَعَسَى اللّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَ بِالْفَتْحِ <br /> <br />Perhaps Allah may bring a victory..., <br /> <br />According to As-Suddi, <br /> <br />referring to the conquering of Makkah. <br /> <br />أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ <br /> <br />or a decision according to His will, <br /> <br />As-Suddi stated, <br /> <br />means, requiring the Jews and Christians to pay the <b>Jizyah</b>. <br /> <br />فَيُصْبِحُواْ <br /> <br />Then they will become, <br /> <br />meaning, the hypocrites who gave their friendship to the Jews and Christians, will become, <br /> <br />عَلَى مَا أَسَرُّواْ فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves, <br /> <br />of allegiances, <br /> <br />نَادِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />regretful. <br /> <br />for their friendship with the Jews and Christians which did not benefit them or protect them from any harm. Rather, it was nothing but harm, as Allah exposed their true reality to His faithful servants in this life, although they tried to conceal it. <br /> <br />When the signs that exposed their hypocrisy were compiled against them, their matter became clear to Allah's faithful servants. So the believers were amazed at these hypocrites who pretended to be believers, swearing to their faithfulness, yet their claims were all lies and deceit. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ أَهَـوُلاء الَّذِينَ أَقْسَمُواْ بِاللّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ إِنَّهُمْ لَمَعَكُمْ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَأَصْبَحُواْ خَاسِرِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 51" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-51/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">52</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>52</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 53" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-53/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
