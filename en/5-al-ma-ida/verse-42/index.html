If they come to you, to judge between them, then judge between them or turn away from them&#59; the [second] option given here was abrogated by His saying, So judge between them [to the end of] the verse [Q. 5&#59;48]. Therefore, we [Muslims] are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us -- and this is the more sound of al-Shfi`'s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim, however, then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus [of legal scholars and not just al- Shfi`]); if you turn away from them, they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge, between them, then judge justly between them; God loves the just, those that judge fairly, meaning that He will reward them.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ أَكَّالُونَ لِلسُّحْتِ <br /> <br />And whomsoever Allah wants to put in <b>Fitnah</b>, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify; for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment. They (like to) listen to falsehood, to devour <b>Suht</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud and others stated that; <br /> <br />`<b>Suht</b>' refers to bribes. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> states that if one is like this, how can Allah cleanse his heart and accept his supplication. <br /> <br />Allah said to His Prophet, <br /> <br />فَإِن جَأوُوكَ <br /> <br />So if they come to you..., <br /> <br />so that you judge between them, <br /> <br />فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُم أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَإِن تُعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ فَلَن يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />either judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt you in the least. <br /> <br />meaning, there is no harm if you do not judge between them. This is because when they came to you to judge between them, they did not seek to follow the truth, but only what conformed to their lusts. <br /> <br />We should mention here that Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, Ata Al-Khurasani, and several others said that; <br /> <br />this part of the <b>Ayah</b> was abrogated by Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَأَنِ احْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَأ أَنزَلَ اللّهُ <br /> <br />And so judge among them by what Allah has revealed. (5&#59;49) <br /> <br />وَإِنْ حَكَمْتَ فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ <br /> <br />And if you judge, judge with justice between them. <br /> <br />and with fairness, even if the Jews were unjust and outcasts from the path of fairness, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah loves those who act justly. <br /><b>Chastising the Jews for Their Evil Lusts and Desires, While Praising the Tawrah</b> <br /> <br />Allah then chastises the Jews for their false ideas and deviant desires to abandon what they believe is true in their Book, and which they claim is their eternal Law that they are always commanded to adhere to. Yet, they do not adhere to the <b>Tawrah</b>, but they prefer other laws over it, although they believe that these other laws are not correct and do not apply to them. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَيْفَ يُحَكِّمُونَكَ وَعِندَهُمُ التَّوْرَاةُ فِيهَا حُكْمُ اللّهِ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَمَا أُوْلَـيِكَ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 41" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-41/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">42</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>42</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 43" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
