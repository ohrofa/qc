Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ <br /> <br />He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

Therefore, they are just servants like other servants, not gods as ignorant Christian sects claim, may Allah's continued curses cover them until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />انظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ الايَاتِ <br /> <br />Look how We make the <b>Ayat</b> clear to them. <br /> <br />making them unequivocal and plain, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ انظُرْ أَنَّى يُوْفَكُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth). <br /> <br />look at the opinions, misguided ideas, and claims they cling to, even after Our clarification and plain, unequivocal explanation</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 74" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">75</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>75</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 76" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-76/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=75;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
