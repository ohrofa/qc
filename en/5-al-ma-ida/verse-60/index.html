They are worse situated (maknan is for specification), for their abode shall be the Fire, and further astray from the even way', from the path of truth (al-saw' originally means al-wasat, `middle'); the use of sharrun, `worse', and adallu, `further astray', is intended to counter their saying, `We know of no religion worse [sharrun] than yours'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>قُلْ هَلْ أُنَبِّيُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذَلِكَ مَثُوبَةً عِندَ اللّهِ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands the Prophet to say&#59;Shall I inform you about a worse people with Allah on the Day of Resurrection than what you think of us! <br /> <br />They are you, with these characteristics, <br /> <br />مَن لَّعَنَهُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />those who incurred the curse of Allah, <br /> <br />were expelled from His mercy, <br /> <br />وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />and who incurred His wrath, <br /> <br />and anger, after which He will never be pleased with them, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ مِنْهُمُ الْقِرَدَةَ وَالْخَنَازِيرَ <br /> <br />those of whom He transformed into monkeys and swine, <br /> <br />as we mentioned in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b> and as we will mention in Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b>. <br /> <br />Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that Ibn Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger was asked if the current monkeys and swine were those whom Allah transformed. He said, <br /> <br />إنَّ اللهَ لَمْ يُهْلِكْ قَوْمًا أَوْ لَمْ يَمْسَخْ قَوْمًا فَيَجْعَلَ لَهُمْ نَسْلً وَلَا عَقِبًا وَإِنَّ الْقِرَدَةَ وَالْخَنَازِيرَ كَانَتْ قَبْلَ ذلِك <br /> <br />Allah never destroyed a people by transforming them and making offspring or descendants for them. The monkeys and swine existed before that.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَعَبَدَ الطَّاغُوتَ <br /> <br />Those who worshipped <b>Taghut</b>..., <br /> <br />and served them, becoming their servants. <br /> <br />The meaning of this <b>Ayah</b> is&#59; <br /> <br />you, O People of the Scriptures, who mock our religion, which consists of Allah's <b>Tawhid</b>, and singling Him out in worship without others, how can you mock us while these are your characteristics! <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً <br /> <br />such are worse in rank..., <br /> <br />than what you -- People of the Scriptures -- think of us Muslims, <br /> <br />وَأَضَلُّ عَن سَوَاء السَّبِيلِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and far more astray from the straight path. <br /> <br />`More' in the <b>Ayah</b> does not mean that the other party is `less' astray, but it means that the People of the Scriptures are far astray. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَيِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلً <br /> <br />The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose. (25&#59;24) <br /><b>The Hypocrites Pretend to be Believers but Hide their Kufr</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 59" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 61" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
