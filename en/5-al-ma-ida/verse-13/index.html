Yet pardon them, and forgive; surely God loves the good-doers.</p></div><div id="haleem"><h3><span>2</span> Abdul Haleem</h3><p>But they broke their pledge, so We distanced them [from Us] and hardened their hearts.

Overlook this and pardon them: God loves those who do good.</p></div><div id="daryabadi"><h3><span>3</span> Abdul Majid Daryabadi</h3><p>Wherefore for their breach of their bond We accursed them and We made their hearts hard. They pervert the words from the meanings thereof and have abandoned a good portion of that wherewith they were admonished.
