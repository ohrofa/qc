Violate not the sanctity of <b>Sha'a'ir</b> Allah (the symbols of Allah), <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Sha`a'ir</b> Allah means the rituals of <b>Hajj</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>As-Safa</b> and <b>Al-Marwah</b>, and the sacrificial animal are the symbols of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also stated that; <br /><b>Sha`a'ir</b> Allah is what He prohibited. Therefore, it means, do not violate what Allah prohibited. <br /> <br />Allah said afterwards, <br /> <br />وَلَا الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ <br /> <br />nor of the Sacred Month, <br /> <br />for you are required to respect and honor the Sacred Month and to refrain from what Allah forbade during it, such as fighting. This also lays emphasis on avoiding sins during that time. <br /> <br />As Allah said; <br /> <br />يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Month. Say, &#34;Fighting therein is a great (transgression).&#34; (2&#59;217) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />إِنَّ عِدَّةَ الشُّهُورِ عِندَ اللّهِ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا <br /> <br /> <br />(Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year). (9&#59;36) <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that Abu Bakrah said that the Messenger of Allah said during the Farewell <b>Hajj</b>, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الزَّمَانَ قَدِ اسْتَدَارَ كَهَيْيَتِهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ اللهُ السَّمَواتِ وَالاَْرْضَ السَّنَةُ اثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا مِنْهَا أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ثَلَثٌ مُتَوَالِيَاتٌ ذُو الْقَعْدَةِ وَذُو الْحِجَّةِ وَالْمُحَرَّمُ وَرَجَبُ مُضَرَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ جُمَادَى وَشَعْبَان <br /> <br />The division of time has returned as it was when Allah created the Heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred&#59;Three are in succession, (they are&#59;) <b>Dhul-Qa'dah</b>, <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b> and <b>Muharram</b>, and (the fourth is) <b>Rajab</b> of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between <b>Jumada</b> (<b>Ath-Thaniyah</b>) and <b>Sha'ban</b>.) <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> testifies to the continued sanctity of these months until the end of time. <br /><b>Taking the Hady to the Sacred House of Allah, Al-Ka`bah</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا الْهَدْيَ وَلَا الْقَليِدَ <br /> <br />nor of the <b>Hady</b> brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands, <br /> <br />means, do not abandon the practice of bringing the <b>Hady</b> (sacrificial animals) to the Sacred House, as this ritual is a form of honoring the symbols of Allah. <br /> <br />Do not abandon the practice of garlanding these animals on their necks, so that they are distinguished from other cattle. This way, it will be known that these animals are intended to be offered as <b>Hady</b> at the <b>Ka`bah</b>, and thus those who might intend some harm to them would refrain from doing so. Those who see the <b>Hady</b> might be encouraged to imitate this ritual, and indeed, he who calls to a type of guidance, will earn rewards equal to the rewards of those who follow his lead, without decrease in their own rewards. <br /> <br />When the Messenger of Allah intended to perform <b>Hajj</b>, he spent the night at Dhul-Hulayfah, which is also called Wadi Al-Aqiq. In the morning, the Prophet made rounds with his wives, who were nine at that time, performed <b>Ghusl</b> (bath), applied some perfume and performed a two <b>Rak`ah</b> prayer. He then garlanded the <b>Hady</b> and announced aloud his intention to perform <b>Hajj</b> and <b>Umrah</b>. The Prophet's <b>Hady</b> at the time consisted of plenty of camels, more than sixty, and they were among the best animals, the healthiest and most physically acceptable, just as Allah's statement proclaims, <br /> <br />ذلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَـيِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ <br /> <br />Thus it is, and whosoever honors the symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts. (22&#59;32) <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said that Allah's statement, <br />وَلَا الْقَليِدَ <br /> (nor the garlands) means, <br /> <br />&#34;Do not breach their sanctity.&#34; <br /> <br />During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, the people used to garland themselves with animal hair and pelts when they left their areas in months other than the Sacred Months. The idolators of the Sacred House Area used to garland themselves with the tree-stems of the Sacred Area, so that they were granted safe passage.&#34; <br /> <br />This statement was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;There are two <b>Ayat</b> in this Surah (<b>Al-Ma'idah</b>) that were abrogated, the <b>Ayah</b> about the garlands (5&#59;2), and <b> <br />فَإِن جَأوُوكَ فَاحْكُم بَيْنَهُم أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ <br /></b>(So if they come to you (O Muhammad), either judge between them, or turn away from them).&#34; (5&#59;42) <br /><b>The Necessity of Preserving the Sanctity and Safety of those who Intend to Travel to the Sacred House</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلا امِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> <br />nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands&#59;Do not fight people who are heading towards the Sacred House of Allah, which if anyone enters it, he must be granted safe refuge. Likewise, those who are heading towards the Sacred House seeking the bounty and good pleasure of Allah, must not be stopped, prevented, or frightened away from entering the Sacred House. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Ata, Abu Al-Aliyah, Mutarrif bin Abdullah, Abdullah bin Ubayd bin Umayr, Ar-Rabi bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and several others said that, <br />يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ <br /> (seeking the bounty of their Lord), <br /> <br />refers to trading. <br /> <br />A similar discussion preceded concerning the <b>Ayah</b>; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading). (2&#59;198) <br /> <br />Allah said; <br />وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> (and pleasure). <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that the word `pleasure' in the <b>Ayah</b> refers to, &#34;seeking Allah's pleasure by their <b>Hajj</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir mentioned that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed concerning Al-Hutam bin Hind Al-Bakri, who had raided the cattle belonging to the people of Al-Madinah. The following year, he wanted to perform <b>Umrah</b> to the House of Allah and some of the Companions wanted to attack him on his way to the House. Allah revealed, <br />وَلا امِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> (nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord). <br /><b>Hunting Game is Permissible After Ihram Ends</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَادُواْ <br /> <br />But when you finish the <b>Ihram</b>, then hunt, <br /> <br />When you end your <b>Ihram</b>, it is permitted for you to hunt game, which was prohibited for you during <b>Ihram</b>. <br /> <br />Although this <b>Ayah</b> contains a command that takes effect after the end of a state of prohibition (during Ihram in this case), the <b>Ayah</b>, in fact, brings back the ruling that was previously in effect. If the previous ruling was an obligation, the new command will uphold that obligation, and such is the case with recommended and permissible matters. There are many <b>Ayat</b> that deny that the ruling in such cases is always an obligation. Such is also the case against those who say that it is always merely allowed. What we mentioned here is the correct opinion that employs the available evidence, and Allah knows best. <br /><b>Justice is Always Necessary</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَأنُ قَوْمٍ أَن صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَن تَعْتَدُواْ <br /> <br />and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b> (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). <br /> <br />The meaning of this <b>Ayah</b> is apparent, as it commands&#59;Let not the hatred for some people, who prevented you from reaching the Sacred House in the year of Hudaybiyyah, make you transgress Allah's Law and commit injustice against them in retaliation. Rather, rule as Allah has commanded you, being just with every one. We will explain a similar <b>Ayah</b> later on, <br /> <br />وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَأنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى <br /> <br />And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just&#59;that is nearer to piety, (5&#59;8) <br /> <br />which commands&#59;do not be driven by your hatred for some people into abandoning justice, for justice is ordained for everyone, in all situations. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah and his Companions were in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the idolators prevented them from visiting the House, and that was especially hard on them. Later on, some idolators passed by them from the east intending to perform <b>Umrah</b>. So the Companions of the Prophet said, `Let us prevent those (from <b>Umrah</b>) just as their fellow idolators prevented us.' Thereafter, Allah sent down this <b>Ayah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and others said that; <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Shana'an</b>&#34; refers to enmity and hate. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الاِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ <br /> <br />Help you one another in <b>Al-Birr</b> and <b>At-Taqwa</b>; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. <br /> <br />Allah commands His believing servants to help one another perform righteous, good deeds, which is the meaning of `<b>Al-Birr</b>', and to avoid sins, which is the meaning of `<b>At-Taqwa</b>'. <br /> <br />Allah forbids His servants from helping one another in sin, `<b>Ithm</b>' and committing the prohibitions. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said that, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Ithm</b> means abandoning what Allah has ordained, while transgression means overstepping the limits that Allah set in your religion, along with overstepping what Allah has ordered concerning yourselves and others.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />انْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمًا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا <br /> <br />Support your brother whether he was unjust or the victim of injustice. <br /> <br />He was asked, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! We know about helping him when he suffers injustice, so what about helping him when he commits injustice?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />تَحْجُزُهُ وَتَمْنَعُهُ مِنَ الظُّلْمِ فَذَاكَ نَصْرُه <br /> <br />Prevent and stop him from committing injustice, and this represents giving support to him. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith through Hushaym. <br /> <br />Ahmad recorded that one of the Companions of the Prophet narrated the <b>Hadith</b>, <br /> <br />الْمُوْمِنُ الَّذِي يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَيَصْبِرُ عَلَى أَذَاهُمْ أَعْظَمُ أَجْرًا مِنَ الَّذِي لَا يُخَالِطُ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَصْبِرُ عَلى أَذَاهُم <br /> <br />The believer who mingles with people and is patient with their annoyance, earns more reward than the believer who does not mingle with people and does not observe patience with their annoyance. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded a <b>Hadith</b> that states, <br /> <br />مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الاَْجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْيًا <br /> <br /> <br />وَمَنْ دَعَا إِلَى ضَلَلَةٍ كَانَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الاِْثْمِ مِثْلُ اثَامِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ ذلِكَ مِنْ اثَامِهِمْ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />He who calls to a guidance, will earn a reward similar to the rewards of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their rewards. <br /> <br />Whoever calls to a heresy, will carry a burden similar to the burdens of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their own burdens. <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ إِنَّ اللّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in punishment</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-Ma&#39;idah Verse 1" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-1/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-Ma&#39;idah Verse 3" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=2;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
