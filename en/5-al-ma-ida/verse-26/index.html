It is reported that they would travel throughout the night earnestly, but in the morning would find themselves back where they had started. And they would travel all day, with the same result, until they all perished, except those under twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600,000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness, and this was a mercy for them, and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death, he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land, to within a stone's throw, and He did, as related in hadth. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight against the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought against them; it was a Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour, until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad the [following] hadth, `The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>قَالَ فَإِنَّهَا مُحَرَّمَةٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً يَتِيهُونَ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />Therefore it is forbidden to them for forty years; in distraction they will wander through the land. <br /> <br />When Musa supplicated against the Jews for refusing to fight in <b>Jihad</b>, Allah forbade them from entering the land for forty years. They wandered about lost in the land of At-Tih, unable to find their way out. <br /> <br />During this time, tremendous miracles occurred, such as the clouds that shaded them and the manna and quails Allah sent down for them. Allah brought forth water springs from solid rock, and the other miracles that He aided Musa bin Imran with. <br /> <br />During this time, the <b>Tawrah</b> was revealed and the Law was established for the Children of Israel and the Tabernacle of the Covenant was erected. <br /><b>Conquering Jerusalem</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً <br /> (for forty years), <br /> <br />defines, <br />يَتِيهُونَ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> (in distraction they will wander through the land). <br /> <br />When these years ended, Yuwsha bin Nun led those who remained among them and the second generation, and laid siege to Jerusalem, conquering it on a Friday afternoon. When the sun was about to set and Yuwsha feared that the Sabbath would begin, he said (to the sun), <br /> <br />&#34;You are commanded and I am commanded, as well. O Allah! Make it stop setting for me.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah made the sun stop setting until Yuwsha bin Nun conquered Jerusalem. <br /> <br />Next, Allah commanded Yuwsha to order the Children of Israel to enter Jerusalem from its gate while bowing and saying <b>Hittah</b>, meaning, `remove our sins.' Yet, they changed what they were commanded and entered it while dragging themselves on their behinds and saying, <b>`Habbah</b> (a seed) in <b>Sha`rah</b> (a hair).&#34; <br /> <br />We mentioned all of this in the <b>Tafsir</b> of Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas commented, <b> <br />قَالَ فَإِنَّهَا مُحَرَّمَةٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً يَتِيهُونَ فِي الَارْضِ <br /></b> (Therefore it is forbidden to them for forty years; in distraction they will wander through the land). <br /> <br />&#34;They wandered in the land for forty years, during which Musa and Harun died, as well as everyone above forty years of age. When the forty years ended, Yuwsha son of Nun assumed their leadership and later conquered Jerusalem. <br /> <br />When Yuwsha was reminded that the day was Friday and the sun was about to set, while they were still attacking Jerusalem, he feared that the Sabbath might begin. Therefore, he said to the sun, `I am commanded and you are commanded.' <br /> <br />Allah made the sun stop setting and the Jews conquered Jerusalem and found wealth unseen before. They wanted to let the fire consume the booty, but the fire would not do that. Yuwsha said, `Some of you have committed theft from the booty.' So he summoned the twelve leaders of the twelve tribes and took the pledge from them. Then, the hand of one of them became stuck to the hand of Yuwsha and Yuwsha said, `You committed the theft, so bring it forth.' So, that man brought a cow's head made of gold with two eyes made of precious stones and a set of teeth made of pearls. When Yuwsha added it to the booty, the fire consumed it, as they were prohibited to keep the booty.&#34; <br /> <br />There is evidence supporting all of this in the <b>Sahih</b>. <br /><b>Allah Comforts Musa</b> <br /> <br />Comforting Musa, Allah said <br /> <br />فَلَ تَأْسَ عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْفَاسِقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So do not grieve for the rebellious people. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59;Do not feel sorrow or sadness over My judgment against them, for they deserve such judgment. This story chastises the Jews, exposes their defiance of Allah and His Messenger, and their refusal to obey the order for <b>Jihad</b>. They were weak and could not bear the thought of fighting their enemy, being patient, and enduring this way. <br /> <br />This occurred although they had the Messenger of Allah and the one whom He spoke to among them, the best of Allah's creation that time. Their Prophet promised them triumph and victory against their enemies. <br /> <br />They also witnessed the torment and punishment of drowning with which Allah punished their enemy Fir`awn and his soldiers, so that their eyes were pleased and comforted. All this did not happen too long ago, yet they refused to perform Jihad against people who had less than a tenth of the power and strength than the people of Egypt had. Therefore, the evil works of the Jews were exposed to everyone, and the exposure was such an enormous one that the night, or the tail, can never cover its tracks. <br /> <br />They were also blinded by their ignorance and transgression. Thus, they became hated by Allah, and they became His enemies. Yet, they claim that they are Allah's children and His loved ones! May Allah curse their faces that were transformed to the shape of swine and apes, and may Allah's curse accompany them to the raging Fire. May Allah make them abide in the Fire for eternity, and He did; all thanks are due to Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 25" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">26</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>26</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 27" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
