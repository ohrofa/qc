[They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you. They distort words beyond their [proper] places [i.e., usages], saying, &#34;If you are given this, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.&#34; But he for whom Allah intends fitnah – never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against Allah.

They are listeners to the fallacy, listeners to other people who did not come to you. They distort the words after they had been properly placed. They say, “If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, then avoid it.” The one whom Allah wills to put to trial, you cannot do anything for him against Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend to purify. For them there is humiliation in this world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter.</p></div></div></article><article id="clear-quran" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#clear-quran"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>2</span> Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p>O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you.

Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, <br /> <br />These honorable <b>Ayat</b> were revealed about those who rush into disbelief, deviating from the obedience of Allah, His Messenger, preferring their opinions and lusts to what Allah has legislated. <br /> <br />مِنَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ امَنَّا بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَلَمْ تُوْمِن قُلُوبُهُمْ <br /> <br />of such who say, &#34;We believe&#34; with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. <br /> <br />These people pretend to be faithful with their words, but their hearts are empty from faith, and they are the hypocrites. <br /> <br />وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ هِادُواْ <br /> <br />And of the Jews..., <br /> <br />the enemies of Islam and its people, they and the hypocrites all. <br /> <br />سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ <br /> <br />listen much and eagerly to lies..., <br /> <br />and they accept and react to it positively. <br /> <br /> <br />سَمَّاعُونَ لِقَوْمٍ اخَرِينَ لَمْ يَأْتُوكَ <br /> <br />listening to others who have not come to you, <br /> <br />meaning, they listen to some people who do not attend your meetings, O Muhammad. <br /> <br />Or, the <b>Ayah</b> might mean, they listen to what you say and convey it to your enemies who do not attend your audience. <br /><b>The Jews Alter and Change the Law, Such As Stoning the Adulterer</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوَاضِعِهِ <br /> <br />They change the words from their places&#59; <br /> <br />by altering their meanings and knowingly distorting them after they comprehended them. <br /> <br />يَقُولُونَ إِنْ أُوتِيتُمْ هَـذَا فَخُذُوهُ وَإِن لَّمْ تُوْتَوْهُ فَاحْذَرُواْ <br /> <br />they say, &#34;If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!&#34; <br /> <br />It was reported that; <br /> <br />this part of the <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about some Jews who committed murder and who said to each other, &#34;Let us ask Muhammad to judge between us, and if he decides that we pay the <b>Diyah</b>, accept his judgment. If he decides on capital punishment, do not accept his judgment.&#34; <br /> <br />The correct opinion is that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about the two Jews who committed adultery. The Jews changed the law they had in their Book from Allah on the matter of punishment for adultery, from stoning to death, to a hundred flogs and making the offenders ride a donkey facing the back of the donkey. <br /> <br />When this incident of adultery occurred after the <b>Hijrah</b>, they said to each other, &#34;Let us go to Muhammad and seek his judgment. If he gives a ruling of flogging, then implement his decision and make it a proof for you with Allah. This way, one of Allah's Prophets will have upheld this ruling amongst you. But if he decides that the punishment should be stoning to death, then do not accept his decision.&#34; <br /> <br />There are several <b>Hadiths</b> mentioning this story. <br /> <br />Malik reported that Nafi said that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews came to Allah's Messenger and mentioned that a man and a woman from them committed adultery. Allah's Messenger said to them, <br /> <br />مَا تَجِدُونَ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ فِي شَأْنِ الرَّجْمِ <br /> <br /> <br />What do find of the ruling about stoning in the <b>Tawrah</b>? <br /> <br />They said, `We only find that they should be exposed and flogged.' <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Salam said, `You lie. The <b>Tawrah</b> mentions stoning, so bring the <b>Tawrah</b>.' <br /> <br />They brought the <b>Tawrah</b> and opened it but one of them hid the verse about stoning with his hand and recited what is before and after that verse. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Salam said to him, `Remove your hand,' and he removed it, thus uncovering the verse about stoning. So they said, He (Abdullah bin Salam) has said the truth, O Muhammad! It is the verse about stoning.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah decided that the adulterers be stoned to death and his command was carried out. <br /> <br />I saw that man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this <b>Hadith</b> and this is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. <br /> <br />In another narration by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet said to the Jews, <br /> <br />مَا تَصْنَعُون بِهِمَا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What would you do in this case? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;We would humiliate and expose them.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet recited, <br /> <br />قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِالتَّوْرَاةِ فَاتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />Bring here the <b>Tawrah</b> and recite it, if you are truthful. (3&#59;93) <br /> <br />So they brought a man who was blind in one eye and who was respected among them and said to him, &#34;Read (from the <b>Tawrah</b>).&#34; <br /> <br />So he read until he reached a certain verse and then covered it with his hand. He was told, &#34;Remove your hand,&#34; and it was the verse about stoning. <br /> <br />So that man said, &#34;O Muhammad! This is the verse about stoning, and we had hid its knowledge among us.&#34; <br /> <br />So the Messenger ordered that the two adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that; <br /> <br />a Jewish man and a Jewish woman were brought before Allah's Messenger because they committed adultery. The Messenger of Allah went to the Jews and asked them, <br /> <br />مَا تَجِدُونَ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ عَلى مَنْ زَنَى <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What is the ruling that you find in the <b>Tawrah</b> for adultery? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;We expose them, carry them (on donkeys) backwards and parade them in public.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet recited; <br /> <br />قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِالتَّوْرَاةِ فَاتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />Bring here the <b>Tawrah</b> and recite it, if you are truthful. (3&#59;93) <br /> <br />So they brought the <b>Tawrah</b> and read from it until the reader reached the verse about stoning. Then he placed his hand on that verse and read what was before and after it. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Salam, who was with the Messenger of Allah, said, &#34;Order him to remove his hand,&#34; and he removed his hand and under it was the verse about stoning. <br /> <br />So the Messenger of Allah commanded that the adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Umar said, &#34;I was among those who stoned them and I saw the man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some Jews came to the Messenger of Allah and invited him to go to the Quff area. So he went to the house of Al-Midras and they said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! A man from us committed adultery with a woman, so decide on their matter.' <br /> <br />They arranged a pillow for the Messenger of Allah and he sat on it and said, <br /> <br />ايْتُونِي بِالتَّوْرَاة <br /> <br />Bring the <b>Tawrah</b> to me. <br /> <br />He was brought the <b>Tawrah</b> and he removed the pillow from under him and placed the T<b>a</b>wrah on it, saying, <br /> <br />امَنْتُ بِكِ وَبِمَنْ أَنْزَلَك <br /> <br />I trust you and He Who revealed it to you. <br /> <br />He then said, <br /> <br />ايْتُونِي بِأَعْلَمِكُم <br /> <br />Bring me your most knowledgeable person. <br /> <br />So he was brought a young man... &#34; <br /> <br />and then he mentioned the rest of the story that Malik narrated from Nafi. <br /> <br />These <b>Hadiths</b> state that the Messenger of Allah issued a decision that conforms with the ruling in the <b>Tawrah</b>, not to honor the Jews in what they believe in, for the Jews were commanded to follow the Law of Muhammad only. Rather, the Prophet did this because Allah commanded him to do so. He asked them about the ruling of stoning in the <b>Tawrah</b> to make them admit to what the <b>Tawrah</b> contains and what they collaborated to hide, deny and exclude from implementing for all that time. They had to admit to what they did, although they did it while having knowledge of the correct ruling. <br /> <br />What made them go to the Prophet for judgment in this matter was their lusts and desires, hoping that the Prophet would agree with their opinion, not that they believed in the correctness of his judgment. This is why they said, <br />إِنْ أُوتِيتُمْ هَـذَا <br /> (If you are given this), referring to flogging, then take it, <br />وَإِن لَّمْ تُوْتَوْهُ فَاحْذَرُواْ <br /> (but if you are not given this, then beware!) and do not accept or implement it. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَمَن يُرِدِ اللّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ اللّهِ شَيْيًا أُوْلَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُرِدِ اللّهُ أَن يُطَهِّرَ قُلُوبَهُمْ لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي الاخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 40" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-40/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">41</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>41</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 42" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-42/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=41;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
