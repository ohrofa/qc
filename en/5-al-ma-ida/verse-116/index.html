If I indeed had said it, You would have known it. You know what is, hidden by me, in my self, but I do not know what is within Your Self, that is, what You keep hidden of Your knowledge&#59; You are the Knower of things unseen.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>`Isa Rejects Shirk and Affirms Tawhid</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قَالَ اللّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection)&#59; <br /> <br />Allah will also speak to His servant and Messenger, `Isa son of Maryam, peace be upon him, saying to him on the Day of Resurrection in the presence of those who worshipped `Isa and his mother as gods besides Allah, <br /> <br />يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />O `Isa, son of Maryam! Did you say unto men&#59;`Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah!' <br /> <br />This is a threat and a warning to Christians, chastising them in public, as Qatadah and others said, and Qatadah mentioned this <b>Ayah</b> as evidence, <br /> <br />هَذَا يَوْمُ يَنفَعُ الصَّادِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.&#34; (5&#59;119) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِحَقٍّ <br /> <br />He will say&#59;&#34;Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say)... <br /> <br />contains Allah's direction for `Isa to utter the perfect answer. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;`Isa will be taught his argument in reply to what Allah will ask him, <b> <br />وَإِذْ قَالَ اللّهُ <br /> <br />يَاعِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ <br /></b> (And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection)&#59;&#34;O `Isa, son of Maryam! Did you say unto men&#59;`Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah!').&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah then narrated that the Prophet said that Allah taught `Isa to say, <br /> <br />سُبْحَانَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِحَقٍّ <br /> <br />Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say)... <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri narrated this <b>Hadith</b> from Ma`mar from Ibn Tawus from Tawus. <br /> <br />`Isa's statement, <br /> <br />إِن كُنتُ قُلْتُهُ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُ <br /> <br />Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. <br /> <br />means, had I said it, You, my Lord, would have known it, for nothing escapes Your knowledge. Rather, I have not said these words nor did the thought even cross my mind, this why he said, <br /> <br />تَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِي وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِكَ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّمُ الْغُيُوبِ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 115" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-115/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">116</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>116</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 117" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-117/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
