He also reminds them of the covenant and pledges that He took from them to follow the Messenger, support and aid him, implement his Law and convey it on his behalf, while accepting it themselves. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَاقَهُ الَّذِي وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا <br /> <br />And remember Allah's favor upon you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said, &#34;We hear and we obey.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the pledge that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah when they embraced Islam. They used to say, &#34;We gave our pledge of obedience to the Messenger of Allah to hear and obey, in times when we are active and otherwise, even if we were passed on for rights, and not to dispute leadership with its rightful people.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />وَمَا لَكُمْ لَا تُوْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ <br /> <br />وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُوْمِنُوا بِرَبِّكُمْ وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَاقَكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord; and He has indeed taken your covenant, if you are real believers. (57&#59;8) <br /> <br />It was also said that this <b>Ayah</b> (5&#59;7) reminds the Jews of the pledges and promises Allah took from them to follow Muhammad and adhere to his Law, as Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas stated. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br /> <br />And have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah. <br /> <br />in all times and situations. <br /> <br />Allah says that He knows the secrets and thoughts that the hearts conceal, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is All-Knower of the secrets of (your) breasts. <br /><b>The Necessity of Observing Justice</b> <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 6" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> المائدة<span class="num-ar">5</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ma'idah<span> 5</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Al-Maidah</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ma&#39;ida Verse 8" href="/en/5-al-ma-ida/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=5,sura_dir="al-ma-ida",count_ayat=120,number_aya=7;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
