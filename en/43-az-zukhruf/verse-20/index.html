This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. <br /> <br />Fourth&#59;Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ <br /> <br />And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming)&#59;&#34;Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.&#34; <br /> <br />Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. <br /> <br />So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied. (16&#59;36) <br /> <br />وَاسْيلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَأ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ <br /> <br />And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you&#59;&#34;Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious&#34; (43&#59;45) <br /> <br />And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs&#59; <br /> <br />مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ <br /> <br />They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. <br /> <br />meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward. <br /> <br />إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They do nothing but lie! <br /> <br />means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths. <br /> <br />Mujahid said about <br />مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّا يَخْرُصُونَ <br /> (They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!), <br /> <br />&#34;They do not appreciate the power of Allah.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Az-Zukhruf Verse 19" href="/en/43-az-zukhruf/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الزخرف<span class="num-ar">43</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Az-Zukhruf<span> 43</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Az-Zukhruf Verse 21" href="/en/43-az-zukhruf/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
