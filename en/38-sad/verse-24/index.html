As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other, `He has certainly passed judgement on himself!' David was thus alerted [to his deed]. God, exalted be He, says&#59; And David thought, in other words, he became certain, that We had indeed tried him, that We had caused him to fall into a trial, that is, a test, through his love for that woman.
