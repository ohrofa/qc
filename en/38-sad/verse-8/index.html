(43&#59;32) <br /> <br />When they said this, it indicated their ignorance and lack of understanding since they thought it was unlikely that the Qur'an would be revealed to the Messenger and not to somebody else. <br /> <br />بَلْ هُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِّن ذِكْرِي <br /> <br />Nay, but they are in doubt about My Reminder! <br /> <br />بَلْ لَمَّا يَذُوقُوا عَذَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nay, but they have not tasted (My) torment! <br /> <br />means, they say this because they have not yet tasted the punishment and vengeance of Allah. But they will come to know the consequences of what they say and what they rejected on the Day when they are herded into the fire of Hell. <br /> <br />Then Allah points out that He is the One Who is in control of His Creation and Who does whatever He wills, Who gives whatever He wants to whomever He wants, and honors whomever He wants and humiliates whomever He wants, and guides whomever He wants and misguides whomever He wants, and sends the <b>Ruh</b> (Jibril) by His command upon whomsoever He wants among His servants, and seals the hearts of whomever He wants, so no one can guide him apart from Allah. His servants do not possess any power and have no control over His dominion, not even a speck of dust's weight; they do not possess even a thin membrane over a date stone. <br /> <br />Allah says, denouncing them&#59; <br /> <br />أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَايِنُ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّكَ الْعَزِيزِ الْوَهَّابِ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Sad Verse 7" href="/en/38-sad/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> ص<span class="num-ar">38</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Sad<span> 38</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Dawood</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Sad Verse 9" href="/en/38-sad/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=38,sura_dir="sad",count_ayat=88,number_aya=8;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
