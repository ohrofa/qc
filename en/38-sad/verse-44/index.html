When Allah healed him, how could her service, mercy, compassion and kindness be repaid with a beating? So Allah showed him a way out, which was to take a bundle of thin grass, with one hundred stems, and hit her with it once. Thus he fulfilled his oath and avoided breaking his vow. This was the solution and way out for one who had <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah and turned to Him in repentance. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّا وَجَدْنَاهُ صَابِرًا نِعْمَ الْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, We found him patient. How excellent a servant! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)! <br /> <br />Allah praised and commanded him, saying, <b> <br />نِعْمَ الْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ <br /></b> (How excellent a servant! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!) <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا <br /> <br />وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْرًا <br /> <br /> And whosoever has <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.
