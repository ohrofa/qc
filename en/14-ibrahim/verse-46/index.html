plot was with Allah, though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places. <br /> <br />Shu`bah narrated that Abu Ishaq said that Abdur-Rahman bin Dabil said that Ali bin Abi Talib commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ <br /></b>(though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places), <br /> <br />&#34;He who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, took two eaglets and raised them until they became adult eagles. Then he tied each eagle's leg to a wooden box with ropes and left them go hungry. He and another man sat inside the wooden box and raised a staff with a piece of meat on its tip. So, the two eagles started flying. The king asked his companion to tell him what he was seeing, and he described the scenes to him, until he said that he saw the earth as a fly. So, the king brought the staff closer to the eagles and they started landing slowly. This is why Allah said, <b> <br />وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ <br /></b> `though their plot was hardly one to remove the mountains from their places.&#34;' <br /> <br />Mujahid also mentioned that; <br /> <br />this story was about Nebuchadnezzar, and that when the king's sight was far away from earth and its people, he was called, `O tyrant one! Where are you headed to!' He became afraid and brought the staff closer to the eagles, which flew faster with such haste that the mountains almost shook from the noise they made. The mountains were almost moved from their places, so Allah said, <b> <br />وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ <br /></b>(though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places).&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj narrated that Mujahid recited this <b>Ayah</b> in a way that means, <br /> <br />&#34;though their plot was such as to remove the mountains from their places.&#34; <br /> <br />However, Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said that, <b> <br />وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ <br /></b> (though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places), <br /> <br />indicates that their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places. <br /> <br />Similar was said by Al-Hasan Al-Basri. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reasoned that, <br /> <br />&#34;Associating others with Allah and disbelieving in Him, which they brought upon themselves, did not bother the mountains nor other creatures. Rather, the harm of their actions came to haunt them.&#34; <br /> <br />I (Ibn Kathir) said, this meaning is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَمْشِ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَرَحًا إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ الاٌّرْضَ وَلَن تَبْلُغَ الْجِبَالَ طُولاً <br /> <br />And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height. (17&#59;37) <br /> <br />There is another way of explaining this <b>Ayah</b>; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said that, <b> <br />وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ الْجِبَالُ <br /></b>(though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places), <br /> <br />refers to their <b>Shirk</b>, for Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />Whereby the heavens are almost torn. (19&#59;90) <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said similarly</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>And verily they plotted, against the Prophet (s), their plot -- when they desired to kill him, or detain him [in his house] or banish him -- but their plotting is with God, that is to say, knowledge or the requital thereof [is with God], and their plotting, even though it be great, was not such whereby mountains should be moved, meaning that it is not of any importance, but that they are only harming themselves thereby. It is said that the use of `mountains' here is meant to be literal; alternatively, it is also said [to be a reference to] the laws of Islam, which are likened to these [mountains] in the way that they are established and fixed (a variant reading has la-tazlu [instead of li-tazla], with in softened [from inna, `verily'], in which case the intended meaning is that [the extent of] their plotting is great. It is said that `plotting' here is [actually a reference to] their unbelief. This second [reading] is consonant with [God's saying]&#59; Whereby the heavens are almost torn and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall crashing [Q. 19&#59;90]; according to the former [reading], however, one should read it as [if it were] wa-m kna, and [their plotting] was not such ...).</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Mighty indeed were the plots which they made, but their plots were (well) within the sight of Allah, even though they were such as to shake the hills!</p></div></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ibrahim Verse 45" href="/en/14-ibrahim/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> - <span lang="ar"> ابراهيم <span class="num-ar">14</span> : <span class="num-ar">46</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ibrahim <span>14</span>:<span>46</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ibrahim Verse 47" href="/en/14-ibrahim/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div></main><div id="features"></div><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Make a donation</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>Copyright &copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <strong>QuranO</strong>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/bundle.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
