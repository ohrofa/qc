Muhammad bin Abdullah, Allah's Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, was sent to all people. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي <br /> <br />نُصِرْتُ بِالرُّعْبِ مَسِيرَةَ شَهْرٍ <br /> <br />وَجُعِلَتِ لِيَ الاَْرْضُ مَسْجِدًا وَطَهُورًا <br /> <br />وَأُحِلَّتْ لِيَ الْغَنَايِمُ وَلَمْ تُحَلَّ لاِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي <br /> <br />وَأُعْطِيتُ الشَّفَاعَةَ <br /> <br />وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة <br /> <br />I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me. <br /> <br />Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month's journey. <br /> <br />The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for worship and a purifier. <br /> <br />The war booty has been made lawful for me and it was not lawful for anyone else before me. <br /> <br />I have been given the right of Intercession (on the Day of Resurrection). <br /> <br />Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only, but I have been sent to all mankind. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah...
