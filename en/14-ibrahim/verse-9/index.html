Their messengers brought them clear signs, with lucid arguments demonstrating their truthfulness; but they, that is, the communities, thrust their hands into their mouths, to bite on them, out of extreme spite, and said, `Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent, according to what you claim, and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us', [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Earlier Nations disbelieved in Their Prophets</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَالَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللّهُ <br /> <br />Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of <b>Nuh</b>, <b>`Ad</b>, and <b>Thamud</b>, and those after them! None knows them but Allah. <br /> <br />Allah narrated to this <b>Ummah</b> (followers of Muhammad) the stories of the people of Prophet <b>Nuh</b>, <b>`Ad</b> and <b>Thamud</b>, and other ancient nations that belied their Messengers. Only Allah knows the count of these nations, <br /> <br />جَاءتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ <br /> <br />To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, <br /> <br />they brought them evidences and plain, tremendous proofs and signs. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq reported that Amr bin Maymun said that Abdullah said about Allah's statement, <br />لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلااَّ اللّهُ <br /> (None knows them but Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;The genealogists utter lies.&#34; <br /> <br />This is why Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;We did not find anyone who knows the forefathers of Ma`dd bin Adnan.&#34; <br /><b>Meaning of, &#34;They put Their Hands in Their Mouths&#34;</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَرَدُّواْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِي أَفْوَاهِهِمْ <br /> <br />but they put their hands in their mouths, <br /> <br />It is said that they pointed to the Messengers' mouths asking them to stop calling them to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />It is also said that it means, they placed their hands on their mouths in denial of the Messengers. <br /> <br />It was also said that it means that they did not answer the call of the Messengers, or they were biting their hands in rage. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Qatadah said that; <br /> <br />they belied the Messengers and refuted their call with their mouths. <br /> <br />I (Ibn Kathir) say that Mujahid's <b>Tafsir</b> is supported by the completion of the narrative, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَا أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِ وَإِنَّا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَنَا إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and said&#59;&#34;Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When they heard Allah's Word, they were amazed and placed their hands on their mouths,&#34; <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَا أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِ <br /> <br />and said&#59;&#34;Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.&#34; <br /> <br />They said, We do not believe what you brought us, and have strong doubt in its authenticity.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ibrahim Verse 8" href="/en/14-ibrahim/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> ابراهيم<span class="num-ar">14</span> :<span class="num-ar">9</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ibrahim<span> 14</span>:<span>9</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ibrahim Verse 10" href="/en/14-ibrahim/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
