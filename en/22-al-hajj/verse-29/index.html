The end of rituals is the <b>Tawaf</b> around the <b>`Atiq</b> House.&#34;' <br /> <br />I say, this is what the Messenger of Allah did. When he came back from Mina on the day of Sacrifice, he began with stoning the <b>Jamrah</b>, stoning it with seven pebbles, then he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head, then he departed and circumambulated the House.&#34; <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b> it was recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The people were commanded to end their visit to the <b>Ka`bah</b> by circumambulating the House, but menstruating women are exempt from this. <br /> <br />بِالْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ <br />(the <b>`Atiq</b> House) the area from behind <b>Al-Hijr</b>, because this was originally part of the <b>Ka`bah</b> built by Ibrahim, but the Quraysh excluded it from the House (when they had to rebuild it) because they were short of funds. The Messenger of Allah included it in his <b>Tawaf</b> and said that it is part of the House. He did not acknowledge the two <b>Shami</b> corners, because they were not built precisely upon the original foundations of Ibrahim. <br /> <br />Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />وَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا بِالْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ <br /></b> (and circumambulate the <b>`Atiq</b> House), <br /> <br />&#34;Because it is the first House established for mankind.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />It was recorded that Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was called <b>Al-Bayt Al-`Atiq</b> because it survived (<b>U`tiqa</b>) from the flood at the time of Nuh.&#34; <br /> <br />Khusayf said, <br /> <br />&#34;It was called <b>Al-Bayt Al-`Atiq</b> because it was never conquered by any tyrant.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 28" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 30" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
