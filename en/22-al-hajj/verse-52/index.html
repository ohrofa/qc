Then Allah establishes His revelations. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise&#59; <br /> <br />At this point many of the scholars of <b>Tafsir</b> mentioned the story of the <b>Gharaniq</b> and how many of those who had migrated to Ethiopia came back when they thought that the idolators of the Quraysh had become Muslims, but these reports all come through <b>Mursal</b> chains of narration and I do not think that any of them may be regarded as <b>Sahih</b>. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari narrated that Ibn Abbas said, <br />فِي أُمْنِيَّتِهِ <br /> (in his recitation (of the revelation), <br /> <br />&#34;When he spoke, the <b>Shaytan</b> threw (some falsehood) into his speech, but Allah abolished that which the <b>Shaytan</b> threw in.&#34; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ اللَّهُ ايَاتِهِ <br /> <br />Then Allah establishes His revelations. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br />إِذَا تَمَنَّى أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي أُمْنِيَّتِهِ <br /> (when he did recite (the revelation), <b>Shaytan</b> threw (some falsehood) in it). <br /> <br />&#34;When he spoke, the <b>Shaytan</b> threw (some falsehood) into his speech.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said&#59; <br />إِذَا تَمَنَّى <br /> (when he did recite), <br /> <br />&#34;When he spoke.&#34; <br /> <br />It was said that it refers to his recitation, whereas, <br />إِلاَّ أَمَانِىَّ <br /> (but they trust upon <b>Amani</b>), <br /> <br />means they speak but they do not write. <br /> <br />Al-Baghawi and the majority of the scholars of <b>Tafsir</b> said&#59; <br />تَمَنَّى <br /> (he did recite), <br /> <br />&#34;Reciting the Book of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي أُمْنِيَّتِهِ <br /> (<b>Shaytan</b> threw (some falsehood) in it), <br /> <br />&#34;In his recitation.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said&#59; <br />إِذَا تَمَنَّى <br /> (when he did recite), <br /> <br />&#34;When he recited.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;This comment is more akin to interpretation.&#34; <br /> <br />فَيَنسَخُ اللَّهُ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ <br /> <br />But <b>Yansakh</b> Allah that which <b>Shaytan</b> throws in. <br /> <br />The meaning of the word <b>Naskh</b> in Arabic is to remove or lift away. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means, Allah cancels out that which the <b>Shaytan</b> throws in.&#34; <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Knower, <br /> <br />means, He knows all matters and events that will happen, and nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him. <br /> <br />حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Wise. <br /> <br />means, in His decree, creation and command, He has perfect wisdom and absolute proof, hence He says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 51" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-51/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">52</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>52</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 53" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-53/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
