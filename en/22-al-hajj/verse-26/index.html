(2&#59;125) <br /> <br />And Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْيًا <br /> <br />Associate not anything with Me, <br /> <br />meaning, `Build it in My Name Alone.' <br /> <br />وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ <br /> <br />and sanctify My House, <br /> <br />Qatadah and Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;And purify it from <b>Shirk</b>. <br /> <br />لِلطَّايِفِينَ وَالْقَايِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up, and those who bow, and make prostration (in prayer). <br /> <br />means, `and make it purely for those who worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate.' <br /> <br />What is meant by &#34;those who circumambulate it&#34; is obvious, since this is an act of worship that is done only at the <b>Ka`bah</b> and not at any other spot on earth. <br /> <br />وَالْقَايِمِينَ <br />(and those who stand up), means, in prayer. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ <br /> <br /> <br />and those who bow, and make prostration. <br /><b>Tawaf</b> and prayer are mentioned together because they are not prescribed together anywhere except in relation to the House. <br /><b>Tawaf</b> is done around the <b>Ka`bah</b> and prayer is offered facing its direction in the majority of cases, with a few exceptions, such as when one is uncertain of the direction of the <b>Qiblah</b>, during battle and when praying optional prayers while traveling. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 25" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">26</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>26</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 27" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=22,sura_dir="al-hajj",count_ayat=78,number_aya=26;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
