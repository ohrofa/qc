The exceptive clause [above] is a discontinuous one; but it could also be [taken as] continuous, so that the prohibition is of that which has died and so on. So avoid the abomination of idols (mina'l-awthn&#59; min here is explicative [as opposed to partitive], in other words, `[avoid abomination], namely, idols'), and avoid false speech, that is to say, ascribing partners to God in your [uttering of the] talbiya, or [avoid] bearing false witness;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Reward for avoiding Sin</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ <br /> <br />Such (is the Pilgrimage)&#59; <br /> <br />`This is what We have commanded you to do in the rituals (of <b>Hajj</b>), and this is the great reward that the person who does that will gain.' <br /> <br />وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />and whoever honors the sacred things of Allah, <br /> <br />means, whoever avoids disobeying Him and does not transgress that which is sacred, and regards committing sin as a very serious matter, <br /> <br />فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ <br /> <br />then that is better for him with his Lord. <br /> <br />means, he will attain much good and a great reward for doing that. Just as the one who does acts of obedience will earn a great reward, so too, the one who avoids sin will earn a great reward. <br /><b>Cattle are Lawful</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الاْأَنْعَامُ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />The cattle are lawful to you, except those (that will be) mentioned to you. <br /> <br />means, `We have made permissible for you all the <b>An`am</b> (cattle etc.),' and Allah has not instituted things like <b>Bahirah</b> or a <b>Sa'ibah</b> or a <b>Wasilah</b> or a <b>Ham</b>. <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />except those mentioned to you. <br /> <br />the prohibition of; <br /><b>Al-Maytah</b>, <br /> <br />blood, <br /> <br />the flesh of swine, <br /> <br />and that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) <br /> <br />and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns -- <br /> <br />and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal -- unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - <br /> <br />and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on <b>An-Nusub</b>. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Jarir, who recorded it from Qatadah. <br /><b>The Command to shun Shirk and Lying</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاْاَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So shun the <b>Rijis</b> of the idols, and shun false speech. <br /> <br />From this it is clear what <b>Ar-Rijs</b> means, i.e., avoid the abomination, which means idols. <b>Shirk</b> is mentioned in conjunction with false speech, as in the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالاِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are; <br /><b>Al-Fawahish</b> (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, <br /> <br />sins (of all kinds), <br /> <br />unrighteous oppression, <br /> <br />joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, and <br /> <br />saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge&#34;. (7&#59;33) <br /> <br />This includes bearing false witness. <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b> it was reported from Abu Bakrah that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَا أُنَبِّــيُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَايِرِ <br /> <br />Shall I not tell you about the worst of major sins? <br /> <br />We said, &#34;Yes, O Messenger of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الاِْشْرَاكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ <br /> <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> <br />&#59; <br /> <br /> أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور <br /> <br />and indeed giving false statements, and indeed bearing false witness... <br /> <br />and he kept on repeating it until we wished that he would stop.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Khuraym bin Fatik Al-Asadi said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah prayed <b>As-Subh</b> (<b>Al-Fajr</b>), and when he had finished, he stood up and said&#59; <br /> <br />عَدَلَتْ شَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ الاِْشْرَاكَ بِاللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل <br /> <br />Bearing false witness is on a par with the association of others with Allah. <br /> <br />Then he recited this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاْاَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />حُنَفَاء لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ <br /> <br />So shun the <b>Rijs</b> of the idols, and shun lying speech. <b>Hunafa'</b> <b>Lillah</b>, not associating partners unto Him; <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 29" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">30</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>30</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 31" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-31/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
