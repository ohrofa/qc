Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; surely they are doomed.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, &#34;Then Allah revealed the words&#59; <br /> <br />أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />Permission (to fight) is given to those (believers) fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#34;Then I knew that there would be fighting.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad added&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Ibn Abbas said, `This was the first <b>Ayah</b> to be revealed concerning fighting.&#34;' <br /> <br />This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the Book of <b>Tafsir</b> of their <b>Sunans</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said&#59;&#34;It is a <b>Hasan Hadith</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />.. <br />وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />and surely, Allah is able to give them victory. <br /> <br />means, He is able to grant victory to His believing servants without any fighting taking place, but He wants His servants to strive their utmost in obeying Him, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَاءً حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَأءُ اللَّهُ لَانْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ <br /> <br /> سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ <br /> <br />وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ <br /> <br />So, when you meet those who disbelieve, strike necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly. Thereafter either for generosity, or ransom, until war lays down its burden. Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them. But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. <br /> <br />But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them. (47&#59;4-6) <br /> <br />قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَأءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br />Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people, and remove the anger of their (believers') hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. (9&#59;14-15) <br /> <br />وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّى نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّـبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَـرَكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard and the patient, and We shall test your facts. (47&#59;31). <br /> <br />And there are many similar <b>Ayat</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ <br /></b> (and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory), <br /> <br />&#34;And this is what He did.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah prescribed <b>Jihad</b> at an appropriate time, because when they were in Makkah, the idolators outnumbered them by more than ten to one. Were they to engage in fighting at that time, the results would have been disastrous. When the idolators went to extremes to persecute Muslims, to expel the Prophet and resolving to kill him; when they sent his Companions into exile here and there, so that some went to Ethiopia and others went to Al-Madinah; when they settled in Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah joined them there, and they gathered around him and lent him their support, and they had a place where Islam prevailed, and a stronghold to which they could retreat; then Allah prescribed <b>Jihad</b> against the enemy, and this was the first <b>Ayah</b> to be revealed for it. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ <br /></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 38" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-38/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">39</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>39</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 40" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-40/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=22,sura_dir="al-hajj",count_ayat=78,number_aya=39;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
