For the believers want to support the religion of Allah, while the disbelievers want to extinguish the light of faith and to defeat the truth and cause falsehood to prevail. <br /> <br />This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is good. <br /><b>The Punishment of the Disbelievers</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ <br /> <br />then as for those who disbelieved, garments of fire will be cut out for them, <br /> <br />meaning, pieces of fire will be prepared for them. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Of copper, for it is the hottest of things when it is heated.&#34; <br /> <br />يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُوُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 18" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 20" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=22,sura_dir="al-hajj",count_ayat=78,number_aya=19;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
