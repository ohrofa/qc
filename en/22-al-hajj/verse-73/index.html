And if a fly should take away something from them, [such as a drop] of the scents or the saffron in which they drench themselves, they would not be able to recover that from it, because of their [complete] incapacity&#59; so how can they worship those [whom they suppose to be] partners of God, exalted be He? An odd thing -- which He has expressed by striking a similitude. Feeble is the seeker, the worshipper, and the [thing] sought, the [thing] worshipped!</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The insignificance of the Idols and the foolishness of their Worshippers</b> <br /> <br />Here Allah points out the insignificance of the idols and the foolishness of those who worship them. <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ضُرِبَ مَثَلٌ <br /> <br />O mankind! A parable has been made, <br /> <br />meaning, a parable of that which is worshipped by those who are ignorant of Allah and who join others as partners with Him. <br /> <br />فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ <br /> <br />so listen to it, <br /> <br />pay attention and understand. <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ <br /> <br />Verily, those on whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. <br /> <br />Even if all the idols and false gods whom you worship were to come together to create a single fly, they would not be able to do that. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah recorded the <b>Marfu`</b> report&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ خَلْقًا كَخَلْقِي فَلْيَخْلُقُوا مِثْلَ خَلْقِي ذَرَّةً أَوْ ذُبَابَةً أَوْ حَبَّة <br /> <br />&#34;Who does more wrong than one who tries to create something like My creation! Let them create an ant or a fly or a seed like My creation!&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by the authors of the Two <b>Sahihs</b> via `Umarah from Abu Zur`ah from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ ذَهَبَ يَخْلُقُ كَخَلْقِي فَلْيَخْلُقُوا ذَرَّةً فَلْيَخْلُقُوا شَعِيرَة <br /> <br />Allah says&#59;&#34;Who does more wrong than one who tries to create (something) like My creation! Let them create an ant, let them create a grain of barley.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ الذُّبَابُ شَيْيًا لاَّ يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly. <br /> <br />They are unable to create a single fly and, moreover, they are unable to resist it or take revenge against it if it were to take anything from the good and perfumed thing on which it lands. If they wanted to recover that, they would not be able to, even though the fly is the weakest and most insignificant of Allah's creatures. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ضَعُفَ الطَّالِبُ وَالْمَطْلُوبُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So weak are the seeker and the sought. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The seeker is the idol and the sought is the fly.&#34; <br /> <br />This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is what is apparent from the context. <br /> <br />As-Suddi and others said, <br /> <br />&#34;The seeker is the worshipper, and the sought is the idol.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 72" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">73</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>73</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 74" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
