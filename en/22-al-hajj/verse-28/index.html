Material benefits in this world include sacrificial animals and trade. <br /> <br />This was also the view of Mujahid and others, that the benefits come in this world and in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord. (2&#59;198) <br /> <br />وَيَذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللَّهِ فِي أَيَّامٍ مَّعْلُومَاتٍ عَلَى مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّن بَهِيمَةِ الاَْنْعَامِ <br /> <br />and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice). <br /> <br />Shu`bah and Hushaym narrated from Abu Bishr from Sa`id from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />&#34;The appointed days are the ten days (of <b>Dhul-Hijjah</b>). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari narrated this with a disconnected chain in a manner denoting his approval of it. <br /> <br />Something similar was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibrahim An-Nakhai. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn Abbas that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا الْعَمَلُ فِي أَيَّامٍ أَفْضَلَ مِنْهَا فِي هَذِه <br /> <br />No deeds are more virtuous than deeds done on these days. <br /> <br />They said, &#34;Not even <b>Jihad</b> for the sake of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />وَلَا الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ يَخْرُجُ يُخَاطِرُ بِنَفْسِهِ وَمَالِهِ فَلَمْ يَرْجِعْ بِشَيْء <br /> <br />Not even <b>Jihad</b> for the sake of Allah, unless a man goes out risking himself and his wealth for the sake of Allah, and does not come back with anything. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أَعْظَمَ عِنْدَ اللهِ وَلَاا أَحَبُّ إِلَيْهِ الْعَمَلُ فِيهِنَّ مِنْ هَذِهِ الاْاَيَّامِ الْعَشْرِ فَأَكْثِرُوا فِيهِنَّ مِنَ التَّهْلِيلِ وَالتَّكْبِيرِ وَالتَّحْمِيد <br /> <br />There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so increase your <b>Tahlil</b>, <b>Takbir</b>, and <b>Tahmid</b> during these days. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ibn Umar and Abu Hurayrah used to go out in the marketplace during the ten days and say <b>Takbir</b>, and the people would say <b>Takbir</b> when they said <b>Takbir</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />These ten days include the day of <b>`Arafah</b>. <br /> <br />It was recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah was asked about fasting on the day of <b>`Arafah</b>, and he said, <br /> <br />أَحْتَسِبُ عَلَى اللهِ أَنْ يُكَفِّرَ السَّنَةَ الْمَاضِيَةَ وَالاْتِيَة <br /> <br />I hope by Allah that it will be an expiation for the previous year and the coming year. <br /> <br />These ten days include the day of <b>An-Nahr</b> (Sacrifice), which is the greatest day of <b>Hajj</b>, and it was recorded in a <b>Hadith</b> that it is the most virtuous day to Allah. <br /> <br />عَلَى مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّن بَهِيمَةِ الاَْنْعَامِ <br /> <br />over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them. <br /> <br />means, camels, cattle and sheep, as Allah explained in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b>&#59; <br />ثَمَـنِيَةَ أَزْوَجٍ <br /> (eight pairs). (6&#59;143) <br /> <br />فَكُلُوا مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُوا الْبَايِسَ الْفَقِيرَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time. <br /> <br />It was recorded that when the Messenger of Allah offered his sacrifice, he commanded that part of each animal should be taken and cooked, and he ate some of the meat and drank some of the broth. <br /> <br />فَكُلُوا مِنْهَا <br /> (Then eat thereof), <br /> <br />Hushaym narrated from Husayn, from Mujahid, <br /> <br />&#34;This is like the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَـدُواْ <br /> <br />But when you finish the Ihram, you may hunt. (5&#59;2) <br /> <br />فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَوةُ فَانتَشِرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ <br /> <br />Then when the (<b>Jumu`ah</b>) <b>Salah</b> (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land.&#34; (62&#59;10) <br /> <br />This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir in his <b>Tafsir</b>. <br /> <br />الْبَايِسَ الْفَقِيرَ <br /> (the poor having a hard time). <br /> <br />Ikrimah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means the one who is in desperate need whose poverty is apparent, and the poor person who is too proud to ask others for help.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;The one who does not stretch forth his hand (to ask for help).&#34;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 27" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">28</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>28</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 29" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
