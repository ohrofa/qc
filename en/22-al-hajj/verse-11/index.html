If he remained healthy there, and his mare foaled and his wife gave birth to a boy, he would be content, and would say, `I have not experienced anything but good since I started to follow this religion.&#34; <br /> <br />وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ <br /> <br />but if a <b>Fitnah</b> strikes him, <br /><b>Fitnah</b> here means affliction, i.e., if the disease of Al-Madinah befalls him, and his wife gives birth to a babe girl and charity is delayed in coming to him, the <b>Shaytan</b> comes to him and says&#59;&#34;By Allah, since you started to follow this religion of yours, you have experienced nothing but bad things,&#34; and this is the <b>Fitnah</b>. <br /> <br />This was also mentioned by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Jurayj and others among the <b>Salaf</b> when explaining this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Mujahid said, concerning the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />انقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ <br /> <br />he turns back on his face. <br /> <br />&#34;(This means), he becomes an apostate and a disbeliever.&#34; <br /> <br />خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالاْخِرَةَ <br /> <br />He loses both this world and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />means, he does not gain anything in this world. As for the Hereafter, he has disbelieved in Allah the Almighty, so he will be utterly doomed and humiliated. <br /> <br />So Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That is the evident loss. <br /> <br />i.e., the greatest loss and the losing deal.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 10" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الحج<span class="num-ar">22</span> :<span class="num-ar">11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Hajj<span> 22</span>:<span>11</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Hajj Verse 12" href="/en/22-al-hajj/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
