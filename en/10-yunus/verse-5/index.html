He made the rays that come forth from the bright sun as the source of light, and made the beams that come forth from the moon as light. He made them of two different natures so they would not be confused with one another. Allah made the dominion of the sun in the daytime and the moon in the night. He ordained phases for the moon, where it starts small then its light increases until it completes a full moon. Then it begins to decrease until it returns to its first phase at the conclusion of the month. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَالْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَـهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّى عَادَ كَالعُرجُونِ الْقَدِيمِ <br /> <br />لَا الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَأ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلَا الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ <br /> <br />And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit. (36&#59;39-40) <br /> <br />And He said&#59; <br /> <br />وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً <br /> <br />And the sun and the moon for counting. (6&#59;96) <br /> <br />And in this <b>Ayah</b> He said&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَدَّرَهُ <br /> <br />and measured, <br /> <br />that is the moon, <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَدَّرَهُ <br /> <br />مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُواْ عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ <br /> <br />And measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. <br /> <br />The days are revealed by the action of the sun, and the months and the years by the moon. <br /> <br />Allah then stated <br /> <br />مَا خَلَقَ اللّهُ ذَلِكَ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ <br /> .. <br /> <br />Allah did not create this but in truth. <br /> <br />He didn't create that for amusement but with great wisdom and perfect reasoning. <br /> <br />With a similar meaning, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَأءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ <br /> <br /> <br />And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire! (38&#59;27) <br /> <br />He also said&#59; <br /> <br />أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ <br /> <br />فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لَا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ <br /> <br />&#34;Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us!&#34; <br /> <br />So Exalted be Allah, the True King&#59;None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne! (23&#59;115-116) <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br />. <br />يُفَصِّلُ الايَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He explains the <b>Ayat</b> in detail for people who have knowledge. <br /> <br />In other words, He explained the signs and proofs for people who know. <br /> <br />Allah further stated</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yunus Verse 4" href="/en/10-yunus/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يونس<span class="num-ar">10</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yunus<span> 10</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yunus Verse 6" href="/en/10-yunus/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=10,sura_dir="yunus",count_ayat=109,number_aya=5;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
