(18&#59;47) <br /> <br />ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَأوُ <br /> <br />كُمْ <br /> <br />then We shall say to those who did associate partners&#59;&#34;Stop at your place! You and your partners.&#34; <br /> <br />He then will command the idolators to stay where they are and not to move from their destined places so they would be separated from the place of the believers. <br /> <br />فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />Then We shall separate them, <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَامْتَازُواْ الْيَوْمَ أَيُّهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ <br /> <br />(It will be said)&#59;&#34;And O you the criminals! Get you apart this Day (from the believers). (36&#59;59) <br /> <br />Allah also said&#59; <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يَوْمَيِذٍ يَتَفَرَّقُونَ <br /> <br />And on the Day when the Hour will be established - that Day shall (all men) be separated (the believers will be separated from the disbelievers). (30&#59;14) <br /> <br />In the same <b>Surah</b> Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />يَوْمَيِذٍ يَصَّدَّعُونَ <br /> <br />On that Day men shall be divided. (30&#59;43) <br /> <br />means, they shall be divided in two. <br /> <br />This is what will take place when Allah Almighty will come for Final Judgement. The believers intercede to Allah so the Final Judgement may come and they get rid of that state. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />نَحْنُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلَى كُومٍ فَوْقَ النَّاس <br /> <br />On the Day of Resurrection, we will be in a visible place above the (other) people. <br /> <br />Allah tells us here what He is going to command the idolators and their idols to do on the Day of Resurrection <br /> <br />مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَأوُ <br /> <br />كُمْ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />&#34;Stop at your place! You and your partners.&#34; Then We shall separate them, <br /> <br />and that they would deny their worship and claim their innocence from them. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />كَلَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ <br /> <br />Nay, but they will deny their worship of them. (19&#59;82) <br /> <br />إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ <br /> <br />When those who were followed declare themselves innocent of those who followed (them). (2&#59;166) <br /> <br />and; <br /> <br />وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَأيِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ <br /> <br />وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَاءً <br /> <br />And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them. And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies. (46&#59;5-6) <br /> <br />This refers to the partners responding to those who worshipped them, <br /> <br />وَقَالَ شُرَكَأوُهُم مَّا كُنتُمْ إِيَّانَا تَعْبُدُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and their partners shall say&#59;&#34;It was not us that you used to worship.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَكَفَى بِاللّهِ شَهِيدًا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِن كُنَّا عَنْ عِبَادَتِكُمْ لَغَافِلِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yunus Verse 27" href="/en/10-yunus/verse-27/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يونس<span class="num-ar">10</span> :<span class="num-ar">28</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yunus<span> 10</span>:<span>28</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yunus Verse 29" href="/en/10-yunus/verse-29/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=10,sura_dir="yunus",count_ayat=109,number_aya=28;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
