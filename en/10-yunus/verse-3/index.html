He tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in six days. <br /> <br />It was said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Like these days (meaning our worldly days).&#34; <br /> <br />It was also said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Every day is like a thousand years of what we reckon.&#34; <br /> <br />Later, this will be discussed further. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ <br /> <br />and then rose over (<b>Istawa</b>) the Throne.&#34; <br /> <br />The Throne is the greatest of the creatures and is like a ceiling for them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />يُدَبِّرُ الَامْرَ <br /> <br />arranging the affair (of all things). <br /> <br />means that He controls the affairs of the creatures. <br /> <br />لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَلَا فِى الااٌّرْضِ <br /> <br />Not even the weight of a speck of dust escapes His Knowledge in the heavens or in the earth. (34&#59;3) <br /> <br />No affair distract' Him from other affairs. No matter troubles Him. The persistent requests of His creatures do not annoy Him. He governs big things as He governs small things everywhere, on the mountains, in the oceans, in populated areas, or in wastelands. <br /> <br />وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا <br /> <br />And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. (11&#59;6) <br /> <br />وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> <br />Not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record. (6&#59;59) <br /> <br />Ad-Darawardi narrated from Sa`d bin Ishaq bin Ka`b bin Ujrah that he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br />إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالَارْضَ <br /> (Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth), they met a great caravan whom they thought should be Arabs. They said to them&#59;`Who are you?' <br /> <br />They replied&#59;`We are Jinns. We left Al-Madinah because of this <b>Ayah</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا مِن شَفِيعٍ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِ <br /> <br />No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after He permits. <br /> <br />This is similar to what is in the following <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ <br /> <br />Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission. (2&#59;255) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لَا تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْياً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَأءُ وَيَرْضَى <br /> <br />And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with. (53&#59;26) <br /> <br />and; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ <br /> <br />Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. (34&#59;23) <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمُ اللّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ أَفَلَ تَذَكَّرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That is Allah, your Lord; so worship Him (alone).
