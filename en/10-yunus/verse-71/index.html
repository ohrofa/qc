Let this be a lesson for your people, lest they will be destroyed like them. <br /> <br />إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ يَا قَوْمِ إِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُم مَّقَامِي وَتَذْكِيرِي بِأيَاتِ اللّهِ فَعَلَى اللّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ <br /> <br />When he said to his people&#59;&#34;O my people, if my stay (with you), and my reminding (you) of the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah is hard on you, then I put my trust in Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning, `if you find that it is too much of an offense that I should live among you and preach to you the revelation of Allah and His signs and proofs, then I do not care what you think, and I will not stop inviting you.' <br /> <br />فَأَجْمِعُواْ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَاءكُمْ <br /> <br />So devise your plot, you and your partners, <br /> <br />`get together with all of your deities (idols and statues) that you call upon beside Allah,' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ لَا يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً <br /> <br />and let not your plot be in confusion for you, <br /> <br />meaning, and do not be confused about this, rather come and let us settle this together if you claim that you are truthful,' <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اقْضُواْ إِلَيَّ <br /> <br />Then pass your sentence on me, <br /> <br />وَلَا تُنظِرُونِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and give me no respite. <br /> <br />`Do not give me respite even for one hour. Whatever you can do, go ahead and do it. I do not care, and I do not fear you, because you are not standing on anything.' <br /> <br />This is similar to what <b>Hud</b> said to his people, <br /> <br />إِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّى أُشْهِدُ اللَّهِ وَاشْهَدُواْ أَنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ <br /> <br />مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />I call Allah to witness, and you bear witness, that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship with Him (Allah). So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord!
