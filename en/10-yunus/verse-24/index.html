This plant grows from the water that comes down from the sky. These plants are food for people, such as fruits and other different types and kinds of foods. Some other kinds are food for cattle such as clover plants (i.e. green fodder for the cattle) and herbage etc. <br /> <br /> حَتَّىَ إِذَا أَخَذَتِ الَارْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا <br /> <br />until when the earth is clad in its adornments, <br /> <br />وَازَّيَّنَتْ <br /> <br />and is beautified, <br /> <br />meaning, it became good by what grows on its hills such as blooming flowers of different shapes and colors. <br /> <br />وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَا <br /> <br />and its people think... <br /> <br />those who planted it and put it in the ground, <br /> <br />أَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَأ <br /> <br />that they have all the powers of disposal over it, <br /> <br />to cultivate it and harvest it. But while they were in that frame of mind, a thunderbolt or a severe, cold storm came to it. It dried its leaves and spoiled its fruits. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَتَاهَا أَمْرُنَا لَيْلً أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيدًا <br /> <br />Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, <br /> <br />it became dry after it was green and flourishing. <br /> <br />كَأَن لَّمْ تَغْنَ بِالَامْسِ <br /> <br />as if it had not flourished yesterday! <br /> <br />as if nothing existed there before. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;As if it had not flourished; as if it was never blessed.&#34; <br /> <br />Such are things after they perish, they are as if they had never existed. <br /> <br />Similarly, the <b>Hadith</b>, <br /> <br />يُوْتَى بِأَنْعَمِ أَهْلِ الدُّنْيَا فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّارِ غَمْسَةً فَيُقَالُ لَهُ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ خَيْرًا قَطُّ <br /> <br /> هَلْ مَرَّ بِكَ نَعِيمٌ قَطُّ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ لَا <br /> <br />وَيُوْتَى بِأَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا فِي الدُّنْيَا فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّعِيمِ غَمْسَةً ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ هَلْ رَأَيْتَ بُوْسًا قَطُّ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ لَا <br /> <br />A person who led the most prosperous life in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the Fire.

Then he will be asked&#59;'Did you ever face any hardship or misery!' <br /> <br />He will reply&#59;`No.' <br /> <br />Allah said about those who were destroyed&#59; <br /> <br />فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَكَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَأ <br /> <br />So they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes; as if they had never lived there.
