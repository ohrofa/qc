The sweet water is like that in rivers, springs and wells, which is fresh, sweet, palatable water. <br /> <br />This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and of Ibn Jarir, and this is the meaning without a doubt, for nowhere in creation is there a sea which is fresh and sweet. <br /> <br />Allah has told us about reality so that His servants may realize His blessings to them and give thanks to Him. The sweet water is that which flows amidst people. Allah has portioned it out among His creatures according to their needs; rivers and springs in every land, according to what they need for themselves and their lands. <br /> <br />وَهَذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ <br /> <br /> <br />and that is salty and bitter; <br /> <br />meaning that it is salty, bitter and not easy to swallow. <br /> <br />This is like the seas that are known in the east and the west, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits that lead to it, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and so on, all the seas that are stable and do not flow, but they swell and surge in the winter and when the winds are strong, and they have tides that ebb and flow. At the beginning of each month the tides ebb and flood, and when the month starts to wane they retreat until they go back to where they started. When the crescent of the following month appears, the tide begins to ebb again until the fourteenth of the month, then it decreases. <br /> <br />Allah, may He be glorified, the One Whose power is absolute, has set these laws in motion, so all of these seas are stationary, and He has made their water salty lest the air turn putrid because of them and the whole earth turn rotten as a result, and lest the earth spoil because of the animals dying on it. Because its water is salty, its air is healthy and its dead are good (to eat), hence when the Messenger of Allah was asked whether sea water can be used for <b>Wudu</b>', he said&#59; <br /> <br />هُوَ الطَّهُورُ مَاوُهُ الْحِلُّ مَيْتَتُه <br /> <br />Its water is pure and its dead are lawful. <br /> <br />This was recorded by Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and by the scholars of <b>Sunan</b> with a good (Jayyid) chain of narration. <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them. <br /> <br />meaning, between the sweet water and the saltwater. <br /> <br />بَرْزَخًا <br /> (a barrier), <br /> <br />means a partition, which is dry land. <br /> <br />وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا <br /> (and a complete partition), <br /> <br />means, a barrier, to prevent one of them from reaching the other. <br /> <br />This is like the <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ <br /> <br />بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لاَّ يَبْغِيَانِ <br /> <br />فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ <br /> <br />He has let loose the two seas meeting together. Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny! (55&#59;19-21) <br /> <br />أَمَّن جَعَلَ الاٌّرْضَ قَرَاراً وَجَعَلَ خِلَلَهَأ أَنْهَاراً وَجَعَلَ لَهَا رَوَاسِىَ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ حَاجِزاً أَءِلـهٌ مَّعَ اللهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br />Is not He Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and placed firm mountains therein, and set a barrier between the two seas! Is there any god with Allah! Nay, but most of them know not! (27&#59;61) <br /> <br />And Allah says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 52" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفرقان<span class="num-ar">25</span> :<span class="num-ar">53</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Furqan<span> 25</span>:<span>53</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 54" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-54/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=25,sura_dir="al-furqan",count_ayat=77,number_aya=53;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
