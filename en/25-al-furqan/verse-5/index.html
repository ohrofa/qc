It is known through <b>Mutawatir</b> reports and is a common fact that Muhammad the Messenger of Allah never learned to read or write, either at the beginning or the end of his life. He grew up among them for approximately forty years, from the time he was born until the time when his mission began. They knew all about him, and about his honest and sound character and how he would never lie or do anything immoral or bad. They even used to call him <b>Al-Amin</b> (the Trustworthy One) from a young age, until his mission began, because they saw how truthful and honest he was. When Allah honored him with that which He honored him, they declared their enmity towards him and came up with all these accusations which any reasonable person would know he was innocent of. They were not sure what to accuse him of. <br /> <br />Sometimes they said that he was a sorcerer, at other times they would say he was a poet, or crazy, or a liar. <br /> <br />So Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلً <br /> <br />See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way. (17&#59;48) <br />In response to their stubbornness, Allah says here</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 4" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفرقان<span class="num-ar">25</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Furqan<span> 25</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 6" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=25,sura_dir="al-furqan",count_ayat=77,number_aya=5;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
