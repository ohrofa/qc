This was the principal town of the towns inhabited by the people of Lot; God destroyed its inhabitants for their committing acts of lewdness. Can it be that they have not seen it?, on their journeys to Syria, and so take heed thereof? (the interrogative is affirmative). Nay, but it is that they do not expect, they have [no] fear of [any], resurrection, and so they do not believe.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِي أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السَّوْءِ <br /> <br />And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained the evil rain. <br /> <br />refers to the town of the people of Lut, which was called Sodom, and the way in which Allah dealt with it, when He destroyed it by turning it upside down and by sending upon it the rain of stones of baked clay, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَأءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ <br /> <br />And We rained on them a rain. And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned! (26&#59;176) <br /> <br />وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ <br /> <br />وَبِالَّيْلِ أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br />Verily, you pass by them in the morning. And at night; will you not then reflect! (37&#59;137-138) <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٍ مُّقِيمٍ <br /> <br />And verily, they were right on the highroad. (15&#59;76) <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> <br />They are both on an open highway, plain to see. (15&#59;79) <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَفَلَمْ يَكُونُوا يَرَوْنَهَا <br /> <br />Did they not then see it! <br /> <br />meaning, so that they might learn a lesson from what happened to its inhabitants of punishment for denying the Messenger and going against the commands of Allah. <br /> <br />بَلْ كَانُوا لَا يَرْجُونَ نُشُورًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nay! But they used not to expect any resurrection. <br /> <br />means, the disbelievers who passed by it did not learn any lesson, because they did not expect any resurrection, i.e., on the Day of Judgement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 39" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-39/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفرقان<span class="num-ar">25</span> :<span class="num-ar">40</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Furqan<span> 25</span>:<span>40</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 41" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-41/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
