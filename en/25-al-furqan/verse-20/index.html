They used to go around in the marketplaces seeking to engage in trade and earn a livelihood. This should not, however, affect their status as Messengers, for Allah gave them good characteristics and caused them to speak fine words and do noble deeds, and gave them miracles and clear proofs, from which any person with sound insight may see the confirmation that what they brought from Allah was true. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is similar to the <b>Ayat</b>; <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى <br /> <br />And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships. (12&#59;109) <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَـهُمْ جَسَداً لاَّ يَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ <br /> <br />And We did not create them bodies that ate not food. (21&#59;8) <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ <br /> <br />And We have made some of you as a trial for others; will you have patience, <br /> <br />means, `We test some of you by means of others, so that We may see who will be obedient and who will be disobedient.' <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِيرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />will you have patience! And your Lord is Ever All-Seer. <br /> <br />meaning, He knows who deserves to receive revelation, as Allah says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ <br /> <br />Allah knows best with whom to place His Message. (6&#59;124) <br /> <br />And He knows who deserves to be guided to the Message with which He sent them, and who does not deserve to be guided. <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ <br /> <br />And We have made some of you as a trial for others. Will you have patience. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah is saying, &#34;If I had willed that the world be such that no one would oppose My Messengers, I could have made it so, but I wanted to test My servants by means of them.&#34; <br /> <br />In <b>Sahih</b> Muslim it is narrated from Iyad bin Himar that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى إِنِّي مُبْتَلِيكَ وَمُبْتَلٍ بِك <br /> <br />Allah says&#59;&#34;I will test you and test others by means of you.&#34; <br /> <br />In the <b>Sahih</b> it is recorded that he was given the choice between being a Prophet and king, or being a servant and Messenger, and he chose to be a servant and Messenger</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 19" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الفرقان<span class="num-ar">25</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Furqan<span> 25</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Furqan Verse 21" href="/en/25-al-furqan/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=25,sura_dir="al-furqan",count_ayat=77,number_aya=20;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
