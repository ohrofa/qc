Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners. <br /><b>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَشْهِدُوا ذَوَيْ عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ <br /> <br />وَأَقِيمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ لِلَّهِ <br /> <br />And take as witness two just persons from among you. <br /> <br />And establish the testimony for Allah. <br /> <br />meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. Imran said, <br /> <br />&#34;His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata' commented on the Ayah, <br />وَأَشْهِدُوا ذَوَيْ عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ <br /> (And take as witness two just persons from among you). <br /> <br />&#34;It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُوْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاْخِرِ <br /> <br />That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. <br /> <br />means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.' <br /> <br />This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah's punishment in the Hereafter. <br /><b>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 1" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-1/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الطلاق<span class="num-ar">65</span> :<span class="num-ar">2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Talaq<span> 65</span>:<span>2</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Surat An-Nisa' Al-Qusra</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 3" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=65,sura_dir="at-talaq",count_ayat=12,number_aya=2;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
