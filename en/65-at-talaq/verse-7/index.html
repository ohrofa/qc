(2&#59;286) <br /><b>A Story of a Woman who had Taqwa</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement; <br /> <br /> سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah will grant after hardship, ease. <br /> <br />This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah's promises are true and He never breaks them, <br /> <br />This is an Allah's saying; <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً <br /> <br />إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً <br /> <br />Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief. (94&#59;5-6) <br /> <br />There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, <br /> <br />&#34;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat' <br /> <br />She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah's provisions.' <br /> <br />He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.' <br /> <br />She said, `Wait a little longer.' <br /> <br />She was awaiting Allah's mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.' <br /> <br />She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven's cover, so do not be hasty.' <br /> <br />When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.' <br /> <br />So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah added, <br /> <br />&#34;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad)! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, <br /> <br />لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا لَطَحَنَتْهَا إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 6" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الطلاق<span class="num-ar">65</span> :<span class="num-ar">7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Talaq<span> 65</span>:<span>7</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Surat An-Nisa' Al-Qusra</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 8" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-8/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=65,sura_dir="at-talaq",count_ayat=12,number_aya=7;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
