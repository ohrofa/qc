If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. <br /> <br />This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, then she has the right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not. <br /><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Then if they suckle them for you, <br /> <br />meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the <b>`Iddah</b>, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant's well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَأتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ <br /> <br />Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأْتَمِرُوا بَيْنَكُم بِمَعْرُوفٍ <br /> <br />and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. <br /> <br />meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surah Al-Baqarah, <br /> <br />لَا تُضَأرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ <br /> <br />No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child. (2&#59;233) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him. <br /> <br />meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. <br /> <br />If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 5" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الطلاق<span class="num-ar">65</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Talaq<span> 65</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Surat An-Nisa' Al-Qusra</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 7" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=65,sura_dir="at-talaq",count_ayat=12,number_aya=6;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
