And if they are pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. Then, if they suckle for you, your children [whom you have] from them, give them their wages, for the suckling, and consult together, with them, honourably, with kindness, for the sake of the children, by mutual agreement on a fixed wage for the suckling. But if you both make difficulties, regarding the suckling, with either the father withholding [payment of] the wage or the mother refraining from performing it, then another woman will suckle [the child] for him, for the father, and the mother should not be compelled to suckle it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her <b>`Iddah</b> period, <br /> <br />أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم <br /> <br />Lodge them where you dwell, <br /> <br />means, with you, <br /> <br />مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ <br /> <br />according to what you have, <br /> <br />Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to &#34;Your ability.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.&#34; <br /><b>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا تُضَارُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ <br /> <br /> <br />and do not harm them in order to suppress them. <br /> <br />Muqatil bin Hayyan said, <br /> <br />&#34;meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.&#34; <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.&#34; <br /><b>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كُنَّ أُولَاإتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ <br /> <br /> <br />And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden. <br /> <br />This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. <br /> <br />This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, then she has the right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not. <br /><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />Then if they suckle them for you, <br /> <br />meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the <b>`Iddah</b>, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant's well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَأتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ <br /> <br />Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأْتَمِرُوا بَيْنَكُم بِمَعْرُوفٍ <br /> <br />and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. <br /> <br />meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surah Al-Baqarah, <br /> <br />لَا تُضَأرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ <br /> <br />No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child. (2&#59;233) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him. <br /> <br />meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. <br /> <br />If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 5" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الطلاق<span class="num-ar">65</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Talaq<span> 65</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Surat An-Nisa' Al-Qusra</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Talaq Verse 7" href="/en/65-at-talaq/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
