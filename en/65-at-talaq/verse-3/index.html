And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. <br /> <br />meaning, whoever has <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an is, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالاْحْسَانِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah enjoins <b>Al-`Adl</b>(justice) and <b>Al-Ihsan</b> (doing good). (16&#59;90) <br /> <br />The greatest Ayah in the Qur'an that contains relief is, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجا <br /> <br />And whosoever has <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.&#34; <br /> <br />Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, &#34;Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was reported from Ibn Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah, <br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجا <br /> (And whosoever has <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out). <br /> <br />&#34;It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives, <br />مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ <br /> (from where he never could imagine). from resources he did not anticipate&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجا <br /> (And whosoever has <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out). <br /> <br />&#34;meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death, <br />وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ <br /> (And He will provide him from where he never could imagine), from where he never thought of or anticipated.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ <br /> <br /> <br />And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abbas said that he rode the Prophet's camel while sitting behind the Prophet, and the Messenger of Allah said to him, <br /> <br />يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الاْاُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلاَّ بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلاَّ بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ رُفِعَتِ الاْاَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف <br /> <br />O boy! <br /> <br />I will teach you words (so learn them). <br /> <br />- Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, <br /> <br />- be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. <br /> <br />- If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. <br /> <br />- Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. <br /> <br />- Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. <br /> <br />The pens have been raised and the pages are dry. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said&#59;&#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses, <br /> <br /> قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْرًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things. <br /> <br />This is like His saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَار <br /> <br />Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.
