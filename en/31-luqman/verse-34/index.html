God, with Him lies knowledge of the Hour, when it will come to pass; and He sends down (read yunzilu, or yunazzilu) the rain, at times which [only] He knows; and He knows what is in the wombs, whether it is a male or a female; and not one of the three things is known by anyone other than God, exalted be He. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, of good or evil, but God, exalted be He, knows this; and no soul knows in what land it will die, but God, exalted be He, knows this. Truly God is Knower, of all things, Aware, of the inward and outward aspects thereof. Al-Bukhr reported [by way of an isnd] from [`Abd Allh] Ibn `Umar the following hadth&#59; `The Keys of the Unseen are five&#59; Lo! God, with Him lies knowledge of the Hour ... to the end of the sra' [above]. Meccan, except for verses 16 to 20 inclusive, which are Medinese; it consists of 30 verses revealed after [srat] al-Mu'minn.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, <br /> <br />The Knower of the Unseen is Allah. These are the keys of the Unseen, whose knowledge Allah alone has kept for Himself, and no one else knows them unless Allah tells him about them. The knowledge of `when the Hour will occur' is not known to any Prophet who was sent or any angel who is close to Allah. <br /> <br />لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَأ إِلااَّ هُوَ <br /> <br />None can reveal its time but He. (7&#59;187) <br /> <br />Similarly, no one but Allah knows when rain will fall, but when He issues the commands, the angels who are entrusted with the task of bringing rain know about it, as do those among His creation whom He wills should know. <br /> <br />No one but He knows what is in the wombs of what He wants to create, but when He decrees whether it is to be male or female, and whether it is to be blessed or doomed, the angels who are entrusted with that know about it, as do those among His creation whom He wills should know. <br /> <br />وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَدًا <br /> <br />No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, <br /> <br />No one knows what he will earn tomorrow with regard to this world or the Hereafter. <br /> <br />وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ <br /> <br />and no person knows in what land he will die. <br /> <br />in his own land or elsewhere, in some other land. No one knows this. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is like the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَأ إِلاَّ هُوَ <br /> <br />And with Him are the keys of the Unseen, none knows them but He. (6&#59;59) <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware. <br /> <br />It was reported in the Sunnah that the above five things are called the Keys of the Unseen. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Buraydah said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say&#59; <br /> <br />خَمْسٌ لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ إِلاَّ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَدًا وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />There are five things which no one knows except Allah&#59; <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, <br /> <br />He sends down the rain, <br /> <br />and knows that which is in the wombs. <br /> <br />No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, <br /> <br />and no person knows in what land he will die. <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware. <br /> <br />The chain of narrators for this <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Sahih</b>, although they did not recorded it. <br /><b>The Hadith of Ibn Umar</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَفَاتِيحُ الْغَيْبِ خَمْسٌ لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ إِلاَّ اللهُ <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَدًا وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />The Keys of the Unseen are five, which no one knows except Allah&#59; <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, <br /> <br />He sends down the rain, <br /> <br />and knows that which is in the wombs. <br /> <br />No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, <br /> <br />and no person knows in what land he will die. <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware. <br /> <br />This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, which he narrated in the Book of the Rain Prayer in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />He also recorded it in his Tafsir with a different chain of narrators, stating that Abdullah bin Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />مَفَاتِيحُ الْغَيْبِ خَمْس <br /> <br />The Keys of the Unseen are five.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he recited&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs... <br /> <br />This too was recorded only by Al-Bukhari. <br /><b>The Hadith of Abu Hurayrah</b> <br /> <br />In his Tafsir of this <b>Ayah</b>, Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah was standing before the people one day when a man came to him and said, <br /> <br />`O Messenger of Allah, what is <b>Iman</b>?' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الاِْيمَانُ أَنْ تُوْمِنَ بِاللهِ وَمَلَيِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلِقَايِهِ وَتُوْمِنَ بِالْبَعْثِ الاْخِر <br /><b>Iman</b> is to believe; <br /> <br />in Allah, <br /> <br />His Angels, <br /> <br />His Books, <br /> <br />His Messengers and <br /> <br />in the meeting with Him, <br /> <br />and to believe in the Resurrection in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />He said&#59;`O Messenger of Allah, what is Islam?' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الاِْسْلَمُ أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْيًا وَتُقِيمَ الصَّلَةَ وَتُوْتِيَ الزَّكَاةَ الْمَفْرُوضَةَ وَتَصُومَ رَمَضَان <br /> <br /> <br />Islam is <br /> <br />to worship Allah Alone and not associate anything in worship with Him, <br /> <br />to establish regular prayer, <br /> <br />to pay the obligatory <b>Zakah</b>, and <br /> <br />to fast in <b>Ramadan</b>. <br /> <br />He said, `O Messenger of Allah, what is <b>Ihsan</b>?' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />الاِْحْسَانُ أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك <br /><b>Ihsan</b> is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then He sees you. <br /> <br />He said, `O Messenger of Allah, when will the Hour come?' <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا الْمَسْوُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّايِلِ وَلكِنْ سَأُحَدِّثُكَ عَنْ أَشْرَاطِهَا <br /> <br />إِذَا وَلَدَتِ الاَْمَةُ رَبَّتَهَا فَذَاكَ مِنْ أَشْرَاطِهَا وَإِذَا كَانَ الْحُفَاةُ الْعُرَاةُ رُوُوسَ النَّاسِ فَذَاكَ مِنْ أَشْرَاطِهَا فِي خَمْسٍ لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ إِلاَّ اللهُ <br /> <br />The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking, but I will tell you of some of its signs&#59; <br /> <br />when the servant woman gives birth to her mistress, that is one of its signs; <br /> <br />when the barefoot and naked become leaders of the people, that is one of its signs. <br /> <br />The timing of the Hour is one of the five things which no one knows except Allah&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.... <br /> <br />Then the man went away, and the Prophet said, <br />رُدُّوهُ عَلَي <br /> (Bring him back to me). <br /> <br />They went to bring him back, but they could not find him. <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />هَذَا جِبْرِيلُ جَاءَ لِيُعَلِّمَ النَّاسَ دِينَهُم <br /> <br />That was Jibril who came to teach the people their religion. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Faith, and by Muslim with several chains of narration. <br /> <br />We have discussed this at the beginning of our commentary on Al-Bukhari, where we mentioned at length some <b>Hadiths</b> narrated by the Commander of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab. These were recorded only by Muslim. <br /> <br />وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ <br /> <br />and no person knows in what land he will die. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;There are some things which Allah has kept to Himself, and they are not known to any angel who is close to Him or any Prophet who was sent by Him. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ <br /> <br />Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, <br /> <br />no one among mankind knows when the Hour will come, in which year or month, or whether it will come at night or during the day. <br /> <br />وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ <br /> <br />He sends down the rain, <br /> <br />and no one knows when rain will come, night or day. <br /> <br />وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الاَْرْحَامِ <br /> <br />and knows that which is in the wombs. <br /> <br />No one knows what is in the wombs, male or female, red or black, or what it is. <br /> <br />وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَداً <br /> <br />No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, <br /> <br />whether it will be good or bad. You do not know, O son of Adam, when you will die. You might die tomorrow, you might be stricken by calamity tomorrow. <br /> <br />وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌ بِأَىِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ <br /> <br />and no person knows in what land he will die. <br /> <br />means, no person knows where his resting place will be, on the land or in the sea, on a plain or in the mountains. <br /> <br />It says in the <b>Hadith</b>&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا أَرَادَ اللهُ قَبْضَ عَبْدٍ بِأَرْضٍ جَعَلَ لَهُ إِلَيْهَا حَاجَة <br /> <br /> <br />If Allah wants to take a person's soul in a particular land, He will give him a reason to go there. <br /> <br />In Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir, Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Usamah bin Zayd said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />مَا جَعَلَ اللهُ مِيتَةَ عَبْدٍ بِأَرْضٍ إِلاَّ جَعَلَ لَهُ فِيهَا حَاجَة <br /> <br /> <br />Allah does not will that a person should die in a certain land but He gives him a reason to go there.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of <b>Surah Luqman</b>. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Sufficient for us is Allah and He is the Best Disposer of affairs</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 33" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-33/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> لقمان<span class="num-ar">31</span> :<span class="num-ar">34</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Luqman<span> 31</span>:<span>34</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
