He used to give legal opinions [in matters of religion] before David was summoned [to prophethood], but lived on into the latter's summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him [David] and refrained from giving [any more] legal opinions, explaining this thus&#59; `Should I not be content if someone [like the prophet David] has spared me the trouble?' He was once asked, `What is the worst kind of person?' He said, `The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil'.

Allah gave him wisdom but withheld Prophethood from him.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awza`i said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abdur-Rahman bin Harmalah told me; `A black man came to Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib to ask him a question, and Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said to him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Do not be upset because you are black, for among the best of people were three who were black&#59;Bilal, Mahja` the freed slave of Umar bin Al-Khattab, and Luqman the Wise, who was a black Nubian with thick lips.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Khalid Ar-Raba`i said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Luqman was an Ethiopian slave who was a carpenter. His master said to him, `Slaughter this sheep for us,' so he slaughtered it. <br /> <br />(His master) said&#59;`Bring the best two pieces from it,' so he brought out the tongue and the heart. <br /> <br />Then time passed, as much as Allah willed, and (his master) said&#59;`Slaughter this sheep for us,' so he slaughtered it. <br /> <br />(His master) said, `Bring the worst two morsels from it,' so he brought out the tongue and the heart. <br /> <br />His master said to him, `I told you to bring out the best two pieces, and you brought these, then I told you to bring out the worst two pieces, and you brought these!' <br /> <br />Luqman said, <br /> <br />`There is nothing better than these if they are good, and there is nothing worse than these if they are bad.&#34;' <br /> <br />Shu`bah narrated from Al-Hakam, from Mujahid, <br /> <br />&#34;Luqman was a righteous servant, but he was not a Prophet.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's saying&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ اتَيْنَا لُقْمَانَ الْحِكْمَةَ <br /> <br />And indeed We bestowed upon Luqman <b>Al-Hikmah</b>, <br /> <br />means, understanding, knowledge and eloquence. <br /> <br />أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِلَّهِ <br /> <br />saying&#59;&#34;Give thanks to Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />means, `We commanded him to give thanks to Allah for the blessings and favors that Allah had given to him alone among his people and contemporaries.' <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَن يَشْكُرْ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ <br /> <br />And whoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for (the good of) himself. <br /> <br />meaning, the benefit of that will come back to him, and Allah's reward is for those who give thanks, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلًّنفُسِهِمْ يَمْهَدُونَ <br /> <br />and whosoever does righteous good deeds, then such will prepare a good place for themselves. (30&#59;44) <br /> <br />وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And whoever is unthankful, then verily, Allah is Rich, Worthy of all praise. <br /> <br />He has no need of His servants and He will not be harmed by that, even if all the people of the earth were to disbelieve, for He has no need of anything or anyone besides Himself. <br /> <br />There is no God but He, and we worship none but Him</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 11" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> لقمان<span class="num-ar">31</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Luqman<span> 31</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 13" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
