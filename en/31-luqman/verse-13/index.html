Join not in worship others with Allah. <br /> <br />Allah tells us how Luqman advised his son. His full name was Luqman bin `Anqa' bin Sadun, and his son's name was Tharan, according to a saying quoted by As-Suhayli. <br /> <br />Allah describes him in the best terms, and states that he granted him wisdom. Luqman advised his son, the closest and most beloved of all people to him, who deserved to be given the best of his knowledge. So, Luqman started by advising him to worship Allah Alone, and not to associate anything with Him. <br /> <br />Then he warned him&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great <b>Zulm</b> (wrong) indeed. <br /> <br />meaning, it is the greatest wrong. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Abdullah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When the <b>Ayah</b> <b> <br />الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُواْ إِيمَانَهُم بِظُلْمٍ <br /></b> (It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with <b>Zulm</b>) (6&#59;82) was revealed, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were distressed by this, and said, <br /> <br />`Who among us does not confuse his belief with <b>Zulm</b>!' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ بِذَاكَ أَلَا تَسْمَعُ إِلَى قَوْلِ لُقْمَانَ <br /> <br />That is not what it means. Have you not heard what Luqman said&#59; <br />يَا بُنَيَّ لَاا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> (O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great <b>Zulm</b> (wrong) indeed)&#34; <br /> <br />It was recorded by Muslim. <br /> <br />When Luqman advised his son to worship Allah Alone, he also told him to honor his parents. This is like the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً <br /> <br />And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. (17&#59;23) <br /> <br />These two things are often mentioned together in the Qur'an. <br /> <br />Allah says here</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 12" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> لقمان<span class="num-ar">31</span> :<span class="num-ar">13</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Luqman<span> 31</span>:<span>13</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 14" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
