No human being knows their essence or nature, or how many they are. As the Leader of Mankind and Seal of the Messengers said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا أُحْصِي ثَنَاءً عَلَيْكَ أَنْتَ كَمَا أَثْنَيْتَ عَلَى نَفْسِك <br /> <br />I cannot praise You enough; You are as You have praised yourself. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الاَْرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَمٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br /> <br />And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea, with seven seas behind it to add to its, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. <br /> <br />meaning, even if all the trees on earth were made into pens and the sea was made into ink, and topped up with seven more like it, and they were used to write the Words of Allah showing His might, attributes and majesty, the pens would break and the ink would run dry, even if more were brought. <br /> <br />The number seven is used to indicate a large amount, it is not to be taken literally or to be understood as referring to the seven oceans of the world, as was suggested by those who took this idea from Israelite stories, which we neither believe nor reject. <br /> <br />As Allah says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِيْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.&#34; (18&#59;109) <br /> <br />The words <br />بِمِثْلِهِ <br /> (like it) do not mean merely another one, but another like it and another and another and another, etc., because there is no limit to the signs and Words of Allah. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. <br /> <br />means, He is All-Mighty and has subjugated all things to His will, so nothing can prevent what He wills, and none can oppose or put back His decision. He is All-Wise in His creation, commands, Words, actions, Laws and all His affairs</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 26" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> لقمان<span class="num-ar">31</span> :<span class="num-ar">27</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Luqman<span> 31</span>:<span>27</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Luqman Verse 28" href="/en/31-luqman/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
