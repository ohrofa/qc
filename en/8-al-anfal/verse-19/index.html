Whichever of the two camps (pagans and Muslims) severed the relation of the womb and brought us what is not familiar, then destroy him this day.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> was later on revealed, <br /> <br />إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَاءكُمُ الْفَتْحُ <br /> <br />If you ask for a judgement, then now has the judgement come unto you, until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Thalabah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abu Jahl asked for (Allah's judgment) when he said upon facing the Muslims, `O Allah! Those among us who severed the relations of the womb and brought forth what we do not recognize, then destroy him this day.&#34;' <br /> <br />This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in the Book of <b>Tafsir</b> (of his <b>Sunan</b>) and Al-Hakim in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, and he said, &#34;It is <b>Sahih</b> according to the criteria of the Two Sheikhs, and they did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar statements were reported from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Yazid bin Ruwman and several others. <br /> <br />As-Suddi commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Before the idolators left Makkah for <b>Badr</b>, they clung to the curtains covering the <b>Ka`bah</b> and supplicated to Allah for victory, `O Allah! Give victory to the exalted among the two armies, the most honored among the two groups, and the most righteous among the two tribes.' <br /> <br />Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَاءكُمُ الْفَتْحُ <br /> <br />If you ask for a judgement, then now has the judgement come unto you. <br /> <br />Allah says here, `I accepted your supplication and Muhammad gained the victory.&#34;' <br /> <br />Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said; <br /> <br />&#34;This is Allah the Most High's answer to their supplication; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ <br /> <br />And (remember) when they said&#59;&#34;O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from you..&#34; (8&#59;32) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ <br /> <br />and if you cease... <br /> <br />from your disbelief and rejection of Allah and His Messenger, <br /> <br />فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ <br /> <br />it will be better for you, <br /> <br />in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَعُودُواْ نَعُدْ <br /> <br />and if you return, so shall We return... <br /> <br />This is similar to another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا <br /> <br />but if you return (to sins), We shall return (to Our punishment). (17&#59;8) <br /> <br />meaning, `if you persist in your disbelief and misguidance, We shall repeat the defeat that you suffered,' <br /> <br />وَلَن تُغْنِيَ عَنكُمْ فِيَتُكُمْ شَيْيًا وَلَوْ كَثُرَتْ <br /> <br />and your forces will be of no avail to you, however numerous they be... <br /> <br />for even if you gather whatever forces you can, then know that those whom Allah is with cannot be defeated, <br /> <br />وَأَنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and verily, Allah is with the believers. <br /> <br />in reference to the Prophet's group, the side of the chosen Messenger</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 18" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنفال<span class="num-ar">8</span> :<span class="num-ar">19</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anfal<span> 8</span>:<span>19</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 20" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
