They were given the same favor during the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, which Allah described, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ الْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاساً يَغْشَى طَأيِفَةً مِّنْكُمْ وَطَأيِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ <br /> <br />Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves. (3&#59;154) <br /> <br />Abu Talhah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was among those who were overcome by slumber during (the battle of) <b>Uhud</b>. The sword fell from my hand several times, and I kept picking it up again, several times. I also saw the Companions' heads nodding while in the rear guard.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la narrated that Ali said, <br /> <br />&#34;Only Al-Miqdad had a horse during <b>Badr</b>, and at some point, I found that all of us fell asleep, except the Messenger of Allah. He was praying under a tree and crying until dawn.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;Slumber during battle is security from Allah, but during prayer, it is from Shaytan.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Slumber affects the head, while sleep affects the heart.&#34; <br /> <br />Slumber overcame the believers on the day of <b>Uhud</b>, and this incident is very well-known. As for this <b>Ayah</b> (8&#59;11), it is describing the battle of <b>Badr</b>, indicating that slumber also overcame the believers during <b>Badr</b>. Therefore, it appears that this will occur for the believers, whenever they are in distress, so that their hearts feel safe and sure of Allah's aid, rewards, favor and mercy from Allah with them. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً <br /> <br />إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً <br /> <br />Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief. (94&#59;5-6) <br /> <br />In the <b>Sahih</b>, it is recorded that; <br /> <br />on the day of <b>Badr</b>, while he was in the bunker with Abu Bakr, the Messenger and Abu Bakr were invoking Allah. Suddenly, slumber overcame the Messenger and he woke up smiling and declared, <br /> <br />أَبْشِرْ يَا أَبَابَكْرٍ هَذَا جِبْرِيلُ عَلَى ثَنَايَاهُ النَّقْع <br /> <br />&#34;Good news, O Abu Bakr! This is Jibril with dust on his shoulders.&#34; <br /> <br />He left the shade while reciting Allah's statement, <br /> <br />سَيُهْزَمُ الْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ <br /> <br />Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs. (54&#59;45) <br /><b>Rain falls on the Eve of Badr</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَيُنَزِّلُ عَلَيْكُم مِّن السَّمَاء مَاء <br /> <br />and He caused rain to descend on you from the sky.) <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Prophet arrived at <b>Badr</b>, he made camp. At the time, there was a sandy piece of land between the idolators and the water (the wells at <b>Badr</b>). Muslims felt weak and the <b>Shaytan</b> cast frustration into their hearts. He whispered to them, `You claim that you are Allah's supporters and that His Messenger is among you! However, the idolators have taken over the water resource from you, while you pray needing purity.' <br /> <br />Allah sent down heavy rain, allowing the Muslims to drink and use it for purity. Allah also removed <b>Shaytan's</b> whisper and made the sand firm when rain fell on it, and the Muslims walked on the sand along with their animals, until they reached the enemy. <br /> <br />Allah supported His Prophet and the believers with a thousand angels on one side, five hundred under the command of Jibril and another five hundred under the command of Mikhail on another side.&#34; <br /> <br />An even a better narration is that collected by Imam Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar, author of Al-Maghazi, may Allah have mercy upon him. Ibn Ishaq narrated that, Yazid bin Ruwman narrated to him that, Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah sent rain down from the sky on a sandy valley. That rain made the area where the Messenger of Allah and his Companions camped firmer so that it did not hinder their movement. Meanwhile, the part that the Quraysh were camping on became difficult to move in.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah sent down the rain on the believers before slumber overtook them, and the rain settled the dust, made the ground firmer, made them feel at ease and their feet firmer.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />لِّيُطَهِّرَكُم بِهِ <br /> <br />to clean you thereby, <br /> <br />using it after answering the call of nature or needing to wash oneself, and this involves cleansing what is on the out side, <br /> <br />وَيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمْ رِجْزَ الشَّيْطَانِ <br /> <br />and to remove from you the <b>Rijz</b> of <b>Shaytan</b>, <br /> <br />such as his whispers and evil thoughts, this involves sinner purification, whereas Allah's statement about the residents of Paradise, <b> <br />عَالِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ <br /> <br />وَحُلُّوا أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ <br /></b> (Their garments will be of fine green silk, and gold embroidery. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver), involves outer appearance, <br />وَسَقَاهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَابًا طَهُورًا <br /> (and their Lord will give them a pure drink), (76&#59;21) that purifies the anger, envy and hatred that they might have felt. This is the inner purity. <br /> <br />Next, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلِيَرْبِطَ عَلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ <br /> <br />and to strengthen your hearts, <br /> <br />with patience and to encourage you to fight the enemies, and this is inner courage, <br /> <br />وَيُثَبِّتَ بِهِ الَاقْدَامَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and make your feet firm thereby. <br /> <br />this involves outer courage. <br /> <br />Allah know best. <br /><b>Allah commands the Angels to fight and support the Believers</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 10" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنفال<span class="num-ar">8</span> :<span class="num-ar">11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anfal<span> 8</span>:<span>11</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 12" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=8,sura_dir="al-anfal",count_ayat=75,number_aya=11;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
