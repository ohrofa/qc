When they saw him, they asked, `Who are you?' <br /> <br />He said, `An old man from Najd. I heard that you are having a meeting, and I wished to attend your meeting. You will benefit from my opinion and advice.' <br /> <br />They said, `Agreed, come in.' <br /> <br />He entered with them. Iblis said, `You have to think about this man (Muhammad)! By Allah, he will soon overwhelm you with his matter (religion).' <br /> <br />One of them said, `Imprison him, restrained in chains, until he dies just like the poets before him all died, such as Zuhayr and An-Nabighah! Verily, he is a poet like they were.' <br /> <br />The old man from Najd, the enemy of Allah, commented, `By Allah! This is not a good idea. His Lord will release him from his prison to his companions, who will liberate him from your hands. They will protect him from you and they might expel you from your land.' <br /> <br />They said, `This old man said the truth. Therefore, seek an opinion other than this one.' <br /> <br />Another one of them said, `Expel him from your land, so that you are free from his trouble! If he leaves your land, you will not be bothered by what he does or where he goes, as long as he is not among you to bring you troubles, he will be with someone else.' <br /> <br />The old man from Najd replied, `By Allah! This is not a good opinion. Have you forgotten his sweet talk and eloquence, as well as, how his speech captures the hearts By Allah! This way, he will collect even more followers among Arabs, who will gather against you and attack you in your own land, expel you and kill your chiefs.' <br /> <br />They said, `He has said the truth, by Allah! Therefore, seek an opinion other than this one.' <br /> <br />Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, spoke next, `By Allah! I have an idea that no one else has suggested yet, and I see no better opinion for you. Choose a strong, socially elevated young man from each tribe, and give each one of them a sharp sword. Then they would all strike Muhammad at the same time with their swords and kill him. Hence, his blood would be shed by all tribes. This way, his tribe, Banu Hashim, would realize that they cannot wage war against all of the Quraysh tribes and would be forced to agree to accept the blood money; we would have brought comfort to ourselves and stopped him from bothering us.' <br /> <br />The old man from Najd commented, `By Allah! This man has expressed the best opinion, and I do not support any other opinion.' <br /> <br />They quickly ended their meeting and started preparing for the implementation of this plan. <br /> <br />Jibril came to the Prophet and commanded him not to sleep in his bed that night and conveyed to him the news of their plot. The Messenger of Allah did not sleep in his house that night, and Allah gave him permission to migrate. After the Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah revealed to him Surah <b>Al-Anfal</b> reminding him of His favors and the bounties He gave him, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expel you (from Makkah); they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the best of plotters. <br /> <br />Allah replied to the pagans' statement that they should await the death of the Prophet, just as the poets before him perished, as they claimed, <br /> <br />أَمْ يَقُولُونَ شَاعِرٌ نَّتَرَبَّصُ بِهِ رَيْبَ الْمَنُونِ <br /> <br />Or do they say&#59;&#34;He is a poet! We await for him some calamity by time!&#34; (52&#59;30) <br /> <br />As-Suddi narrated a similar story. <br /> <br />Allah next tells; <br /> <br />وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />they were plotting and Allah too was plotting, and Allah is the best of plotters. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Muhammad bin Jafar bin Az-Zubayr, from Urwah bin Az-Zubayr who commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />&#34;I (Allah) plotted against them with My sure planning, and I saved you (O Muhammad) from them.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>And, remember, O Muhammad (s), when the disbelievers -- who had gathered to discuss your affair at the council assembly -- were plotting against you, to confine you, to chain you up and imprison you, or slay you -- all of them [acting as] assassins of one man -- or to expel you, from Mecca, and they were plotting, against you, and God was plotting, against them, by devising a way [out] for you, when He revealed to you what they had devised and commanded you to leave [Mecca]; and God is the best of those who plot, the most knowledgeable among them about it.</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-3"><div class="panel-body"><p>Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home).
