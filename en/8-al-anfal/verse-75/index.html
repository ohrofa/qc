Truly God is Knower of all things, including the wisdom regarding [the rules of] inheritance. Medinese [entirely], or [Medinese] except for the last two verses ending with verse 130 [which are Meccan], or [Medinese] except for one verse. The basmala, `In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful', does not preface this [sra] because the Prophet (s) was not commanded to [recite] it [in this way], as may be understood from a hadth reported by al-Hkim, in which he states [by way of an isnd] from `Al that the basmala is [invoked] for `security' (amn), whereas this [sra] was revealed to remove security by way of the sword. According to [a hadth related] by Hudhayfa [b. al-Yamn]&#59; `You call it the sra of Repentance, but it is actually the sra of Chastisement (al-`adhb)'. Al-Bukhr reported [by way of an isnd] from al-Bar' [b. `zib] that this was the last sra to be revealed.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ مَعَكُمْ فَأُوْلَـيِكَ مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />And those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and strove hard along with you, they are of you. <br /> <br />Allah then mentioned that those who follow the path of the believers in faith and performing good deeds, will be with them in the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Just as Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالسَّـبِقُونَ الاٌّوَّلُونَ <br /> <br />And the foremost to embrace Islam... (9&#59;100), until the end of the <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />He also said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ جَأءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ <br /> <br />And those who came after them (59&#59;10) <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> that is in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, which is <b>Mutawatir</b> and has several authentic chains of narrations, mentions that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الْمَرْءُ مَعَ مَنْ أَحَب <br /> <br />One will be in the company of those whom he loves. <br /> <br />Another <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />مَنْ أَحَبَّ قَوْمًا فَهُوَ مِنْهُم <br /> <br />He who loves a people is one of them, <br /> <br />and in another narration, he said, <br /> <br />حُشِرَ مَعَهُم <br />will be gathered with them (on the Day of Resurrection). <br /><b>Inheritance is for Designated Degrees of Relatives</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأُوْلُواْ الَارْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in the decree ordained by Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, in Allah's decision. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> encompasses all relatives, not only the degrees of relative who do not have a fixed, designated share in the inheritance, as some people claim and use this <b>Ayah</b> to argue. <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and several others, this <b>Ayah</b> abrogated inheriting from those with whom one had ties of treaties or brotherhood, as was the case in the beginning of Islam. So it applies to all relatives, and as for those who do not inherit, then this is supported by the <b>Hadith</b>, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَعْطَى كُلَّ ذِي حَقَ حَقَّهُ فَلَ وَصِيَّةٍ لِوَارِث <br /> <br />Indeed Allah had allotted every right to the one who deserves it, so there may be no will for an heir. <br /> <br />Therefore, this <b>Ayah</b> also includes those who have a fixed share of inheritance. Allah knows best. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Anfal</b>, all praise and thanks are for Allah, in Him we trust, and He is sufficient for us, what an excellent supporter He is. <br /> <br />Top</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 74" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنفال<span class="num-ar">8</span> :<span class="num-ar">75</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anfal<span> 8</span>:<span>75</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
