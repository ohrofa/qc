Your forgiveness!'; it is also said that this [last clause] refers to those oppressed believers among them, similar to where God says Had they been clearly separated, verily We would have chastised the disbelievers among them with a painful chastisement [Q. 48&#59;25].</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>And Allah would not punish them while you are among them, nor will He punish them while they seek (Allah's) forgiveness. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Pagans used to go around the House in <b>Tawaf</b> and proclaim, `We rush to Your obedience, O Allah, there is no partner with You,' and the Prophet would tell them, <br /> <br />قَدٍ قَد <br /> <br />Enough, enough. <br /> <br />But they would go on, `We rush to Your obedience, O Allah, there is no partner with You except a partner who is with You, You own Him but he does not own! <br /> <br />They also used to say, `O Allah, Your forgiveness, Your forgiveness.' <br /> <br />Allah revealed this verse; <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ <br /> (And Allah would not punish them while you are among them...).&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;They had two safety shelters&#59; <br /> <br />the Prophet, and <br /> <br />their seeking forgiveness (from Allah). <br /> <br />The Prophet went away, and only seeking forgiveness remained.&#34; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَنْزَلَ اللهُ عَلَيَّ أَمَانَيْنِ لاُِمَّتِي <br /> <br />&#34;Allah sent down to me two safe shelters for the benefit of my <b>Ummah</b>. <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ مُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah would not punish them while you are among them, nor will He punish them while they seek (Allah's) forgiveness. <br /> <br />فَإِذَا مَضَيْتُ تَرَكْتُ فِيهِمُ الاْإسْتِغْفَارَ إِلَى يَومِ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />When I die, I will leave the seeking of forgiveness with them, until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />What testifies to this <b>Hadith</b>, is the <b>Hadith</b> that Ahmad recorded in his <b>Musnad</b> and Al-Hakim in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, that Abu Sa`id narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ قَالَ وَعِزَّتِكَ يَا رَبِّ لَا أَبْرَحُ أَغْوِي عِبَادَكَ مَا دَامَتْ أَرْوَاحُهُمْ فِي أَجْسَادِهِمْ <br /> <br />فَقَالَ الرَّبُّ وَعِزَّتِي وَجَلَلِي لَا أَزَالُ أَغْفِرُ لَهُمْ مَا اسْتَغْفَرُونِي <br /><b>Shaytan</b> said, `By Your might, O Lord! I will go on luring Your servants as long as their souls are still in their bodies.' <br /> <br />The Lord said, `By My might and majesty! I will keep forgiving them, as long as they keep invoking Me for forgiveness.' <br /> <br />Al-Hakim said, &#34;Its chain is <b>Sahih</b> and they did not record it.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 32" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنفال<span class="num-ar">8</span> :<span class="num-ar">33</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Anfal<span> 8</span>:<span>33</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Anfal Verse 34" href="/en/8-al-anfal/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=8,sura_dir="al-anfal",count_ayat=75,number_aya=33;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
