(7&#59;189) <br /> <br />This refers to <b>Hawwa</b>'. Allah created her from Adam, from the short rib on his left. If Allah had made all of Adam's progeny male, and created the females from another kind, such as from Jinn or animals, there would never have been harmony between them and their spouses. There would have been revulsion if the spouses had been from a different kind. <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً <br /> <br />and He has put between you affection and mercy. <br /> <br />Out of Allah's perfect mercy He made their wives from their own kind, and created love and kindness between them. For a man stays with a woman because he loves her, or because he feels compassion towards her if they have a child together, or because she needs him to take care of her, etc. <br /> <br />And Allah reminds&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ar-Rum Verse 20" href="/en/30-ar-rum/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الروم<span class="num-ar">30</span> :<span class="num-ar">21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ar-Rum<span> 30</span>:<span>21</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ar-Rum Verse 22" href="/en/30-ar-rum/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=30,sura_dir="ar-rum",count_ayat=60,number_aya=21;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
