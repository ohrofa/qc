Allah mentioned the story of the owners of the garden in Surah <b>Nun</b>, (68&#59;18-33) <br /> <br />إِنَّا بَلَوْنَـهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَأ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ... <br />لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br />When they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning. Without saying&#59;&#34;If Allah wills.&#34; Then there passed by on the (garden) a visitation (fire) from your Lord at night, burning it while they were asleep. So the (garden) became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (in complete ruins). Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke. Saying&#59;&#34;Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck the fruits.&#34; <br /> <br />So they departed, conversing in secret low tones (saying). &#34;No poor person shall enter upon you into it today.&#34; And they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have power (to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom). But when they saw the (garden), they said&#59;&#34;Verily, we have gone astray.&#34; (Then they said)&#59;&#34;Nay! Indeed we are deprived of (the fruits)!&#34; <br /> <br />The best among them said&#59;&#34;Did I not tell you, why say you not&#59;`If Allah wills'.&#34; They said&#59;&#34;Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been wrongdoers.&#34; <br /> <br />Then they turned one against another, blaming. They said&#59;&#34;Woe to us! We have transgressed. We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord.&#34; <br /> <br />Such is the punishment (in this life), but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew. (68&#59;18-33) <br /><b>Prohibiting Extravagance</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَا تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful. <br /> <br />It was said that; <br /> <br />the extravagance prohibited here refers to excessive charity beyond normal amounts. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said, <br /> <br />&#34;This <b>Ayah</b> was revealed concerning Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas, who plucked the fruits of his date palms. Then he said to himself, `This day, every person who comes to me, I will feed him from it.' <br /> <br />So he kept feeding (them) until the evening came and he ended up with no dates. Allah sent down, <b> <br />وَلَا تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ <br /></b> (And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful).&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded this statement from Ibn Jurayj. <br /> <br />However, the apparent meaning of this <b>Ayah</b>, and Allah knows best, is that; <b> <br />كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَا أَثْمَرَ وَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ <br /></b> <br />وَلَا تُسْرِفُواْ <br /> (Eat of their fruit when they ripen, but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, and waste not...) refers to eating, <br /> <br />meaning, do not waste in eating because this spoils the mind and the body. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ وَلَا تُسْرِفُواْ <br /> <br />And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance. (7&#59;31) <br /> <br />In his <b>Sahih</b>, Al-Bukhari recorded a <b>Hadith</b> without a chain of narration; <br /> <br />كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا وَالْبَسُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ إِسْرَافٍ وَلَا مَخِيلَة <br /> <br />Eat, drink and clothe yourselves without extravagance or arrogance. <br /> <br />Therefore, these <b>Ayat</b> have the same meaning as this <b>Hadith</b>, and Allah knows best. <br /><b>Benefits of Cattle</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 140" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-140/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">141</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>141</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 142" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-142/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
