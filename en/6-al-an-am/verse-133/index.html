(2&#59;143) <br /> <br />إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ <br /> <br />if He wills, He can destroy you. <br /> <br />if you defy His commandments, <br /> <br />وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِن بَعْدِكُم مَّا يَشَاء <br /> <br />And in your place make whom He wills as your successors, <br /> <br />who behave obediently, <br /> <br />كَمَأ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ اخَرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />As He raised you from the seed of other people. <br /> <br />and surely, He is able to do this, and it is easy for Him. And just as Allah has destroyed the earlier nations and brought their successors, He is able to do away with these generations and bring other people in their place. <br /> <br />Allah has also said; <br /> <br />إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ وَيَأْتِ بِـاخَرِينَ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَى ذلِكَ قَدِيراً <br /> <br />If He wills, He can take you away, O people, and bring others. And Allah is Ever Capable over that. (4&#59;133) <br /> <br />يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ أَنتُمُ الْفُقَرَاءُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ <br /> <br />إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُـمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ <br /> <br />وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ <br /> <br />O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah. But Allah is Rich (free of all needs), Worthy of all praise. If He willed, He could destroy you and bring about a new creation. And that is not hard for Allah. (35&#59;15-17) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />نَّفْسِهِ وَاللَّهُ الْغَنِىُّ وَأَنتُمُ الْفُقَرَاءُ وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْاْ يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُونُواْ <br /> <br />But Allah is Rich (free of all needs), and you are poor. And if you turn away, He will exchange you for some other people and they will not be your likes. (47&#59;38) <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yaqub bin Utbah said that he heard Aban bin Uthman saying about this <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />كَمَأ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ اخَرِينَ <br /></b> (As He raised you from the seed of other people), <br /> <br />&#34;`The seed' means the offspring and the children.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ مَا تُوعَدُونَ لاتٍ وَمَا أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 132" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-132/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">133</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>133</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 134" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-134/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
