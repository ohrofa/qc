And truly the devils inspire, whisper [to], their friends, the disbelievers, to dispute with you, in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them, in this [matter], you are truly idolaters.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Prohibition of what was Slaughtered in other than Allah's Name</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ <br /> <br />Eat not of that on which Allah's Name has not been pronounced, for surely it is disobedience. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is used to prove that slaughtered animals are not lawful when Allah's Name is not mentioned over them -- even if slaughtered by a Muslim. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> about hunting game, <b> <br />فَكُلُواْ مِمَّا أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللّهِ عَلَيْهِ <br /></b> (So eat of what they (trained hunting dogs or birds of prey) catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it), (5&#59;4) supports this. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> here emphasized this ruling, when Allah said, <br />وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ <br />(for surely it is disobedience). They say that <br /> <br />&#34;it&#34; refers to eating it, and others say that it refers to the sacrifice for other than Allah. <br /> <br />There are various <b>Hadiths</b> that order mentioning Allah's Name when slaughtering and hunting. <br /> <br />The <b>Hadith</b> narrated by Adi bin Hatim and Abu Thalabah (that the Prophet said); <br /> <br />إِذَا أَرْسَلْتَ كَلْبَكَ الْمُعَلَّمَ وَذَكْرتَ اسْمَ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ فَكُلْ مَا أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْك <br /> <br />When you send your trained hunting dog and mention Allah's Name on releasing it, then eat from whatever it catches for you. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />The Rafi bin Khadij narrated that the Prophet said; <br /> <br />مَا أَنْهَرَ الدَّمَ وَذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ فَكُلُوه <br /> <br />You can use what would make blood flow (i.e., slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud narrated that Allah's Messenger said to the Jinns. <br /> <br />لَكُمْ كُلُّ عَظْمٍ ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللهِ عَلَيْه <br /> <br />(For food) you have every bone on which Allah's Name was mentioned on slaughtering. <br /> <br />Muslim collected this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Jundub bin Sufyan Al-Bajali said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَ فَلْيَذْبَحْ مَكَانَهَا أُخْرَى وَمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ ذَبَحَ حَتَّى صَلَّيْنَا فَلْيَذْبَحْ بِاسْمِ الله <br /> <br />Whoever slaughtered before he prayed (the <b>`Id</b> prayer), let him slaughter another sacrifice in its place. Whoever did not offer the sacrifice before we finished the prayer, let him slaughter and mention Allah's Name. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /><b>The Devil's Inspiration</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَأيِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ <br /> <br />And certainly, the <b>Shayatin</b> do inspire their friends to dispute with you, <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Ishaq said that; <br /> <br />a man said to Ibn Umar that Al-Mukhtar claimed that he received revelation. <br /> <br />So Ibn Umar said, &#34;He has said the truth,&#34; and recited this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَأيِهِمْ <br /> (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends...). <br /> <br />Abu Zamil said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was sitting next to Ibn Abbas at a time when Al-Mukhtar bin Abi Ubayd was performing <b>Hajj</b>. So a man came to Ibn Abbas and said, `O Ibn `Abbas! Abu Ishaq (Al-Mukhtar) claimed that he received revelation this night.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said, He has said the truth.' <br /> <br />I was upset and said, `Ibn Abbas says that Al-Mukhtar has said the truth.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas replied, `There are two types of revelation, one from Allah and one from the devil. Allah's revelation came to Muhammad, while the <b>Shaytan's</b> revelation comes to his friends.' <br /> <br />He then recited, <br />وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَأيِهِمْ <br /> (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends...). <br /> <br />We also mentioned Ikrimah's commentary on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />يُوحِي بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُورًا <br /> (Inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion). (6&#59;112) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br />لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ <br /> (to dispute with you), <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Abbas commented; <br />وَلَا تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللّهِ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (Eat not of that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned...) until, <br />لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ <br /> (...to dispute with you), <br /> <br />&#34;The devils inspire their loyal supporters, `Do you eat from what you kill but not from what Allah causes to die&#34;' <br /> <br />As-Suddi said; <br /> <br />&#34;Some idolators said to the Muslims, `You claim that you seek Allah's pleasure. Yet, you do not eat what Allah causes to die, but you eat what you slaughter.' <br /> <br />Allah said, <b> <br />وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ <br /></b> (and if you obey them...), and eat dead animals, <b> <br />إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ <br /></b> then you would indeed be polytheists.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and several others among scholars of the <b>Salaf</b>. <br /><b>Giving Preference to Anyone's Saying Over the Legislation of Allah is Shirk</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and if you obey them, then you would indeed be polytheists. <br /> <br />means, when you turn away from Allah's command and Legislation to the saying of anyone else, preferring other than what Allah has said, then this constitutes <b>Shirk</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />اتَّخَذُواْ أَحْبَـرَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـنَهُمْ أَرْبَاباً مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah. (9&#59;31) <br /> <br />In explanation of this <b>Ayah</b>, At-Tirmidhi recorded that; <br /> <br />Adi bin Hatim said, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! They did not worship them.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />بَلَى إِنَّهُمْ أَحَلُّوا لَهُمُ الْحَرَامَ وَحَرَّمُوا عَلَيْهِمُ الْحَلَلَ فَاتَّبعُوهُمْ فَذَلِكَ عِبَادَتُهُمْ إِيَّاهُم <br /> <br />Yes they did. They (monks and rabbis) allowed the impermissible for them and they prohibited the lawful for them, and they followed them in that. That was their worship of them.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 120" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-120/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">121</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>121</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 122" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=121;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
