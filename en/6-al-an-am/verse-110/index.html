Allah said; <b> <br />وَلَا يُنَبِّيُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ <br /></b> (And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower). (35&#59;14) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />أَن تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يَا حَسْرَتَى علَى مَا فَرَّطتُ فِي جَنبِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />Lest a person should say, &#34;Alas, my grief that I was undutiful to Allah.&#34; (39&#59;56) until, <br />لَوْ أَنَّ لِي كَرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ <br /> (&#34;If only I had another chance, then I should indeed be among the doers of good).&#34; (39&#59;58) <br /> <br />So Allah, glory be to Him, states that if they were sent back to life, they would not accept the guidance, <b> <br />وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَادُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ <br /></b> (But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars). (6&#59;28) <br /> <br />Allah said, <b> <br />وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْيِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَارَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُوْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ <br /></b> And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time), <br /> <br />meaning&#59;`If they were sent back to this life, they would be prevented from embracing the guidance, just as We prevented them from it the first time, when they were in the life of this world.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَنَذَرُهُمْ <br /> <br />and We shall leave them... <br /> <br />and abandon them, <br /> <br />فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ <br /> <br />in their trespass..., <br /> <br />According to Ibn Abbas and As-Suddi, <br /> <br />meaning, disbelief. <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah, Ar-Rabi bin Anas and Qatadah said that; <br /> <br />`their trespass' means, `their misguidance'. <br /> <br />يَعْمَهُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />to wander blindly. <br /> <br />or playfully, according to Al-A`mash. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-Aliyah, Ar-Rabi, Abu Malik and others commented, <br /> <br />&#34;to wander in their disbelief.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 109" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-109/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">110</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>110</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 111" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
