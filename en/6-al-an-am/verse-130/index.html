Did not there come to you Messengers from among you,&#34; <br /> <br />We should note here that the Messengers are from among mankind only, not vice versa, as Mujahid, Ibn Jurayj and others from the Imams of <b>Salaf</b> and later generations have stated. The proof for this is that Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ <br /> <br />Verily, We have sent the revelation to you as We sent the revelation to Nuh and the Prophets after him. (4&#59;163) until, <br /> <br />رُّسُلً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِيَلَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ <br /> <br />Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers. (4&#59;165) <br /> <br />Allah said, concerning the Prophet Ibrahim, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ <br /> <br />And We ordained among his offspring Prophethood and the Book. (29&#59;27), <br /> <br />thus sending the Prophethood and the Book exclusively through the offspring of the Prophet Ibrahim. No one has claimed that there were Prophets from among the Jinns before the time of Ibrahim, but not after that. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ <br /> <br />And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily, they ate food and walked in the markets. (25&#59;20) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى <br /> <br />And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships. (12&#59;109) <br /> <br />Therefore, concerning Prophethood, the Jinns follow mankind in this regard and this is why Allah said about them, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَأ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ <br /> <br />قَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَأ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ يَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ وَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br />يقَوْمَنَأ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <br /> <br />وَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَأءُ أُوْلَـيِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> <br />And (remember) when We sent towards you a group of the Jinn, listening to the Qur'an. When they stood in the presence thereof, they said&#59;&#34;Listen in silence!&#34; And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners. They said&#59;&#34;O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to the straight way. O our people! Respond to Allah's caller, and believe in him. He (Allah) will forgive you your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire). And whosoever does not respond to Allah's caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no helpers for him besides Allah. Those are in manifest error. (46&#59;29-32) <br /> <br />A <b>Hadith</b> collected by At-Tirmidhi stated that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah recited Surah <b>Ar-Rahman</b>, to these Jinns, in which Allah said, <br /> <br />سَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ أَيُّهَا الثَّقَلَنِ <br /> <br />فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ <br /> <br />We shall attend to you, O you two classes (Jinn and men)! Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both (Jinn and men) deny! (55&#59;31-32) <br /> <br />Allah said in this honorable <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِنسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ <br /> <br />يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ ايَاتِي وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَاء يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا قَالُواْ شَهِدْنَا عَلَى أَنفُسِنَا <br /> <br />O you assembly of Jinn and humans! &#34;Did not there come to you Messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours!&#34; They will say&#59;&#34;We bear witness against ourselves.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, we affirm that the Messengers have conveyed Your Messages to us and warned us about the meeting with You, and that this Day will certainly occur. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />It was the life of this world that deceived them. <br /> <br />and they wasted their lives and brought destruction to themselves by rejecting the Messengers and denying their miracles. This is because they were deceived by the beauty, adornment and lusts of this life. <br /> <br />وَشَهِدُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ <br /> <br />And they will bear witness against themselves, <br /> <br />on the Day of Resurrection, <br /> <br />أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَافِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that they were disbelievers... <br /> <br />in this worldly life, rejecting what the Messengers, (may Allah's peace and blessings be on them), brought them</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 129" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-129/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">130</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>130</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 131" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-131/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
