Therefore, what about His knowledge of the living creatures, especially, those whom the Divine laws have been imposed upon such as mankind and the Jinns. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />يَعْلَمُ خَأيِنَةَ الاٌّعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِى الصُّدُورُ <br /> <br />Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.
