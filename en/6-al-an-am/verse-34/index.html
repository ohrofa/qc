It is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.&#34; Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty. (58&#59;21) <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَلَقدْ جَاءكَ مِن نَّبَإِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, there has reached you the information about the Messengers (before you). <br /> <br />who were given victory and prevailed over the people who rejected them.
