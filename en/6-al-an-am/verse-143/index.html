Say&#59;&#34;Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, <br /> <br />They used to prohibit the usage of some of their cattle and designate them as <b>Bahirah</b>, <b>Sa'ibah</b>, <b>Wasilah</b> and <b>Ham</b> etc. These were some of the innovations they invented for cattle, fruits and produce. Allah stated that He has created gardens, trellised and untrellised, and cattle, as animals of burden and as <b>Farsh</b>. <br /> <br />Allah next mentioned various kinds of cattle, male and female, such as sheep and goats. He also created male and female camels and the same with cows. Allah did not prohibit any of these cattle or their offspring. Rather, they all were created for the sons of Adam as a source for food, transportation, work, milk, and other benefits, which are many. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الاٌّنْعَـمِ ثَمَـنِيَةَ أَزْوَجٍ <br /> <br />And He has sent down for you of cattle eight pairs... (39&#59;6) <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الاُنثَيَيْنِ <br />or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose... <br /> <br />This refutes the idolators' statement, <br />مَا فِي بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الَانْعَامِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَى أَزْوَاجِنَا <br /> (What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone, and forbidden to our females). (6&#59;139) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />نَبِّوُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful. <br /> <br />meaning, tell me with sure knowledge, how and when did Allah prohibit what you claimed is prohibited, such as the <b>Bahirah</b>, <b>Sa'ibah</b>, <b>Wasilah</b> and <b>Ham</b> etc. <br /> <br />Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas said, &#34;Allah's statement, <br />ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ مِّنَ الضَّأْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ الْمَعْزِ اثْنَيْنِ <br /> (Eight pairs&#59;of the sheep two, and of the goats two...), <br /> <br />these are four pairs, <br /> <br />قُلْ الذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ الاُنثَيَيْنِ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Has He forbidden the two males or the two females...&#34; <br /> <br />I (Allah) did not prohibit any of these. <br /> <br />أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الاُنثَيَيْنِ <br /> <br />or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose, <br /> <br />and does the womb produce but males and females! So why do you prohibit some and allow some others! <br /> <br />نَبِّوُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful. <br /> <br />Allah is saying that all of this is allowed.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 142" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-142/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">143</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>143</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 144" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-144/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
