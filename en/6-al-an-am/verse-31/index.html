When the unjust person sees him, he will say, `How ugly is your face!' <br /> <br />He will reply, `So was your work, it was ugly.' <br /> <br />The unjust person will say, `How foul is the odor coming from you!' <br /> <br />He will reply, `Such was the case with your work, it stunk.' <br /> <br />The unjust person will say, `How dirty are your clothes!' <br /> <br />He will reply, `And your work too was dirty.' <br /> <br />The unjust person will ask, `Who are you?' <br /> <br />He will reply, `I am your deeds.' <br /> <br />So he will remain with the unjust person in his grave, and when he is resurrected on the Day of Resurrection, his companion will say to him, `In the life of the world, I used to carry you because you followed desire and lust. Today, you carry me.' <br /> <br />So he will ride on the unjust person's back and lead him until he enters the Fire. <br /> <br />So Allah said, <b> <br />وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلَا سَاء مَا يَزِرُونَ <br /></b> (while they will bear their burdens on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they will bear!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 30" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">31</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>31</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 32" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-32/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=31;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
