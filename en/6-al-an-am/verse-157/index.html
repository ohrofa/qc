(35&#59;42) <br /> <br />Allah replied here, <br /> <br />فَقَدْ جَاءكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ <br /> <br />So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. <br /> <br />Allah says, there has come to you from Allah a Glorious Qur'an revealed to Muhammad, the Arab Prophet. In it is the explanation of the lawful and unlawful matters, guidance for the hearts and mercy from Allah to His servants who follow and implement it. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِأيَاتِ اللّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا <br /> <br />Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah and <b>Sadafa</b> away therefrom, <br /> <br />This refers to the one who neither benefited from what the Messenger brought, nor followed what he was sent with by abandoning all other ways. Rather, he <b>Sadafa</b> from following the <b>Ayat</b> of Allah, meaning, he discouraged and hindered people from following it. <br /> <br />This is the explanation of As-Suddi for <b>Sadafa</b>, while Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah said that <b>Sadafa</b> means, he turned away from it. <br /> <br />سَنَجْزِي الَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ ايَاتِنَا سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />We shall requite those who turn away from Our <b>Ayat</b> with an evil torment, because of their turning away</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 156" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-156/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">157</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>157</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 158" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-158/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
