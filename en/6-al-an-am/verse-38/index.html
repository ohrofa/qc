And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book. (11&#59;6) <br /> <br />there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لاَّ تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ <br /> <br />And so many a moving creature there is, that carries not its own provision! Allah provides for it and for you. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. (29&#59;60) <br /> <br />ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn Abbas said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Death gathers them.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ <br /> <br />And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together. (81&#59;5) <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah's statement, <b> <br />إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم <br /> <br />مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ <br /></b> (but are <b>Umam</b> like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered), <br /> <br />&#34;All creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, the beasts, birds and all others. Allah's justice will be so perfect, that the un-horned sheep will receive retribution from the horned sheep. Allah will then command them, `Be dust!' This is when the disbeliever will say, <b> <br />يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا <br /></b> (&#34;Woe to me! Would that I were dust!)&#34; (78&#59;40) <br /> <br />And this was reported from the Prophet in the <b>Hadith</b> about the Trumpet. <br /> <br />The Disbelievers will be Deaf and Mute in Darkness <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 37" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-37/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">38</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>38</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 39" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-39/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
