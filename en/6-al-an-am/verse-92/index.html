(11&#59;17) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً <br /> <br />Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to the <b>Alamin</b> (mankind and Jinn). (25&#59;1) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالاٍّمِّيِّينَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ <br /> <br />And say to those who were given the Scripture and to those who are illiterates&#59;&#34;Do you submit yourselves!&#34; If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) servants. (3&#59;20) <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي <br /> <br />I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me. <br /> <br />The Prophet mentioned among these five things, <br /> <br />وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة <br /> <br />Every Prophet was sent only to his nation, but I have been sent to all people. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ يُوْمِنُونَ بِالاخِرَةِ يُوْمِنُونَ بِهِ <br /> <br />Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, <br /> <br />meaning, those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, believe in this blessed Book, the Qur'an, which We revealed to you, O Muhammad. <br /> <br />وَهُمْ عَلَى صَلَتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they are constant in guarding their <b>Salah</b>. <br /> <br />for they perform what Allah ordered them, offering the prayers perfectly and on time</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 91" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-91/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">92</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>92</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 93" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-93/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
