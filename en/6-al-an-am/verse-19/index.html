Say&#59; `God -- even if they do not say this, there is no other response -- He, is Witness between me and you, to my truthfulness; and this Qur'n has been revealed to me that I may warn you, [that I may] make you fear, O people of Mecca, thereby, and whomever it may reach (wa-man balagha&#59; this is a supplement to the [suffixed] pronoun [`you'] of undhira-kum, `I may warn you'), that is to say, whomever among men and jinn the Qur'n may reach. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods with God?' (this interrogative is meant as a disavowal). Say, to them&#59; `I do not bear witness', to this.
