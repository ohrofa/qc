They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. <br /> <br />They have no hope for any type of good thing. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, <br /> <br />&#34;Whomever Allah gives provision and he thinks that Allah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.&#34; <br /> <br />He then recited the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَا أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَاهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُونَ <br /> <br />So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. <br /> <br />He added, <br /> <br />&#34;By the Lord of the <b>Ka`bah</b>! Allah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ <br /> <br />وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 43" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 45" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
