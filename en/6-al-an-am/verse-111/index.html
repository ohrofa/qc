(17&#59;92) <br /> <br />قَالُواْ لَن نُّوْمِنَ حَتَّى نُوْتَى مِثْلَ مَأ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;We shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the Messengers of Allah had received.&#34; (6&#59;124) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَأءَنَا لَوْلَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْمَلَـيِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَى رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْا عُتُوّاً كَبِيراً <br /> <br />And those who expect not a meeting with Us said&#59;&#34;Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord!&#34; Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride. (25&#59;21) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى <br /> <br />and the dead had spoken unto them, <br /> <br />This is, to inform them of the truth of what the Messengers brought them; <br /> <br />وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ قُبُلً <br /> <br />and We had gathered together all things before them, <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-Awfi reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />before their eyes. <br /> <br />This is the view of Qatadah and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, if all nations were gathered before them, one after the other, and each one testifies to the truth of what the Messengers came with, <br /> <br />مَّا كَانُواْ لِيُوْمِنُواْ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَاء اللّهُ <br /> <br />they would not have believed, unless Allah willed, <br /> <br />for guidance is with Allah not with them. Certainly, Allah guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills, and He does what He wills, <b> <br />لَاا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ <br /></b> (He cannot be questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned). (21&#59;23) <br /> <br />This is due to His knowledge, wisdom, power, supreme authority and irresistibility. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br />وَلَوْ جَأءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ <br /> <br />Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment. (10&#59;96-97) <br /> <br />وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but most of them behave ignorantly</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 110" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-110/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">111</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>111</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 112" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-112/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=111;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
