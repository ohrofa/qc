(40&#59;16) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَيِذٍ الْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ عَسِيراً <br /> <br />The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Beneficent (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers. (25&#59;26) <br /> <br />The <b>Sur</b> is the Trumpet into which the angel Israfil, peace be upon him, will blow. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ إِسْرَافِيلَ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الصُّورَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُوْمَر فَيَنْفُخ <br /> <br />Israfil has held the <b>Sur</b> in his mouth and lowered his forehead, awaiting the command to blow in it. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin `Amr said, <br /> <br />&#34;A Bedouin man said, `O Allah's Messenger! What is the <b>Sur</b>?' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />قَرْنٌ يُنْفَخُ فِيه <br /> <br />A Trumpet which will be blown.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 72" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-72/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">73</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>73</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 74" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-74/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
