They have indeed gone astray and were not guided. <br /> <br />As for this life, they lost when they killed their children and made it difficult for themselves by prohibiting some types of their wealth, as an act of innovation that they invented on their own. As for the Hereafter, they will end up in the worst dwellings, because they used to lie about Allah and invent falsehood about Him. <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br />مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah will never be successful.&#34; (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve. (10&#59;69-70) <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah recorded that Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;If it pleases you to know how ignorant the Arabs used to be, then recite the <b>Ayat</b> beyond <b>Ayah</b> one hundred and thirty in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b>, <br /> <br />قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ قَتَلُواْ أَوْلَادَهُمْ. <br />وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />Indeed lost are they who have killed their children, foolishly, without knowledge, and (they) have forbidden that which Allah has provided for them, inventing a lie against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and were not guided.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded this in the section of his Sahih on the virtues of the Quraysh</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 139" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-139/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">140</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>140</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 141" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-141/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
