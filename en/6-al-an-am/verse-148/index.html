Allah is able to change this <b>Shirk</b> by directing us to the faith, - they claimed - and prevent us from falling into disbelief, but He did not do that. Therefore - they said Allah indicated that He willed, decided and agreed that we do all this. They said, <br /> <br />لَوْ شَاء اللّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلَا ابَاوُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />&#34;If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَأءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ <br /> <br />And they said&#59;&#34;If it had been the will of the Most Gracious (Allah), we should not have worshipped them (false deities).&#34; (43&#59;20) <br /> <br />Similar is mentioned in Surah <b>An-Nahl</b>. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِم <br /> <br />Likewise belied those who were before them, <br /> <br />for by using and relying on this understanding, the misguided ones before them were led astray. This notion is false and ungrounded, for had it been true, Allah would not have harmed them, destroyed them, aided His honorable Messengers over them, and made them taste His painful punishment. <br /> <br />حَتَّى ذَاقُواْ بَأْسَنَا <br /> <br />till they tasted Our wrath. <br /> <br />قُلْ هَلْ عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Have you any knowledge...&#34; <br /> <br />that Allah is pleased with you and with your ways, <br /> <br />فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَا <br /> <br />that you can produce before us. <br /> <br />and make it plain, apparent and clear for us. <br /> <br />However, <br /> <br />إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ <br /> <br />Verily, you only follow the <b>Zann</b>, <br /> <br />doubts and wishful thinking, <br /> <br />وَإِنْ أَنتُمْ إَلاَّ تَخْرُصُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and you do nothing but lie. <br /> <br />about Allah in the false claims that you utter. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />قُلْ فَلِلّهِ الْحُجَّةُ الْبَالِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَاء لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 147" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-147/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">148</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>148</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 149" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-149/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=148;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
