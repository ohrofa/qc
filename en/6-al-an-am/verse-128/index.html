Many did you mislead of men, <br /> <br />So the <b>Ayah</b>; <br />قَدِ اسْتَكْثَرْتُم مِّنَ الاِنسِ <br /> (Many did you mislead of men) refers to their misguiding and leading them astray. <br /> <br />Allah also said; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ أَعْهَدْ إِلَيْكُمْ يبَنِى ءَادَمَ أَن لاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ الشَّيطَـنَ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ <br /> <br />وَأَنِ اعْبُدُونِى هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ أَضَلَّ مِنْكُمْ جِبِلًّ كَثِيراً أَفَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br />Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship <b>Shaytan</b>. Verily, he is a plain enemy to you. And that you should worship Me. That is the straight path. And indeed he (<b>Shaytan</b>) did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did you not, then, understand. (36&#59;60-62) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَأوُهُم مِّنَ الاِنسِ رَبَّنَا اسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ <br /> <br />and their friends among the people will say&#59;&#34;Our Lord! We benefited one from the other...&#34; <br /> <br />The friends of the Jinns among humanity will give this answer to Allah, after Allah chastises them for being misguided by the Jinns. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan commented, <br /> <br />&#34;They benefited from each other when the Jinns merely commanded and mankind obeyed.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, a man would reach a land and proclaim, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley,' and this is how they benefited from each other. They used this as an excuse for them on the Day of Resurrection.&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, the Jinns benefit from humans since humans revere the Jinns by invoking them for help. The Jinns would then proclaim, &#34;We became the masters of both mankind and the Jinns.&#34; <br /> <br />وَبَلَغْنَا أَجَلَنَا الَّذِيَ أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا <br /> <br />but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us. <br /> <br />meaning, death, according to As-Suddi. <br /> <br />قَالَ النَّارُ مَثْوَاكُمْ <br /> <br />He (Allah) will say&#59;&#34;The Fire be your dwelling place...&#34; <br /> <br />where you will reside and live, you and your friends, <br /> <br />خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />you will dwell therein forever. <br /> <br />and will never depart except what Allah may will. <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَا شَاء اللّهُ <br />. <br /> <br />except as Allah may will. <br /> <br />إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَليمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 127" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-127/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">128</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>128</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 129" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-129/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
