Insulting their deities will lead to a bigger evil than its benefit, for the idolators might retaliate by insulting the God of the believers, Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but He. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn Abbas commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;They (disbelievers) said, `O Muhammad! You will stop insulting our gods, or we will insult your Lord.' Thereafter, Allah prohibited the believers from insulting the disbelievers' idols, <br />فَيَسُبُّواْ اللّهَ عَدْوًا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ <br /> (lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge).&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Muslims used to insult the idols of the disbelievers and the disbelievers would retaliate by insulting Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Allah revealed, <br />وَلَا تَسُبُّواْ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ <br /> (And insult not those whom they worship besides Allah).&#34; <br /> <br />On this same subject -- abandoning what carries benefit to avert a greater evil - it is recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَلْعُونٌ مَنْ سَبَّ وَالِدَيْه <br /> <br />Cursed is he who insults his own parents! <br /> <br />They said, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! And how would a man insult his own parents!&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />يَسُبُّ أَبَا الرَّجُلِ فَيَسُبُّ أَبَاهُ وَيَسُبُّ أُمَّهُ فَيَسُبُّ أُمَّه <br /> <br />He insults a man's father, and that man insults his father, and insults his mother and that man insults his mother. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ زَيَّنَّا لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ عَمَلَهُمْ <br /> <br />Thus We have made fair seeming to each people its own doings; <br /> <br />means, as We made fair seeming to the idolators loving their idols and defending them, likewise We made fair seeming to every previous nation the misguidance they indulged in. Allah's is the most perfect proof, and the most complete wisdom in all that He wills and chooses. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّهِم مَّرْجِعُهُمْ <br /> <br />then to their Lord is their return, <br /> <br />gathering and final destination, <br /> <br />فَيُنَبِّيُهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do. <br /> <br />He will compensate them for their deeds, good for good and evil for evil</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 107" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-107/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">108</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>108</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 109" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-109/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=108;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
