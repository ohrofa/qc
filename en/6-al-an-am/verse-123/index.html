Such was also the case with the Messengers before you, who were tested with the same. But the good end was always theirs.' Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br />Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals. (25&#59;31) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا أَرَدْنَأ أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُواْ فِيهَا <br /> <br />And when We decide to destroy a town, We send a definite order to those among them who lead a life of luxury, and they transgress therein. (17&#59;16) <br /> <br />meaning, We command them to obey Us, but they defy the command and as a consequence, We destroy them. <br /> <br />It was also said that, &#34;We send a definite order&#34;, <br /> <br />in the last <b>Ayah</b> means, &#34;We decree for them,&#34; as Allah stated here <br />لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا <br /> (to plot therein). <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas explained the <b>Ayah</b> <br />أَكَابِرَ مُجَرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا <br /> (...great ones of its wicked people to plot therein), <br /> <br />&#34;We give the leadership to these wicked ones and they commit evil in it. When they do this, We destroy them with Our torment.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid and Qatadah said that; <br /> <br />in the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />أَكَابِرَ مُجَرِمِيهَا <br /></b> (great ones) refers to leaders. <br /> <br />I say that this is also the meaning of Allah's statements, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَأ إِنَّا بِمَأ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَكْثَـرُ أَمْوَلاً وَأَوْلَـداً وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ <br /> <br />And We did not send a warner to a township, but those who were given the worldly wealth and luxuries among them, said&#59;&#34;We believe not in what you have been sent with.&#34; And they say&#59;&#34;We have too much wealth and too many children and we are not going to suffer punishment.&#34; (34&#59;34-35) <br /> <br />And, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ مَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَأ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَأ ءَابَأءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ <br /> <br />And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town but the luxurious ones among them said&#59;&#34;We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.&#34; (43&#59;23) <br /> <br />`Plot' in the <b>Ayah</b> (6&#59;123) refers to beautified speech and various actions with which the evil ones call to misguidance. <br /> <br />Allah said about the people of Prophet Nuh, peace be upon him, <br /> <br />وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً كُبَّاراً <br /> <br />And they have plotted a mighty plot. (71&#59;22) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَن نُّوْمِنَ بِهَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ وَلَا بِالَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ مَوْقُوفُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ الْقَوْلَ يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ لَوْلَا أَنتُمْ لَكُنَّا مُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />قَالَ الَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ أَنَحْنُ صَدَدنَـكُمْ عَنِ الْهُدَى بَعْدَ إِذْ جَأءَكُمْ بَلْ كُنتُمْ مُّجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ بَلْ مَكْرُ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَأ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِاللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُ أَندَاداً <br /> <br />But if you could see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant&#59;&#34;Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers.&#34; <br /> <br />And those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak&#59;&#34;Did we keep you back from guidance after it had come to you! Nay, but you were criminals.&#34; <br /> <br />Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant&#59;&#34;Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals for Him!&#34; (34&#59;31-33) <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Ibn Abi Umar said that Sufyan said, <br /> <br />&#34;Every `plot' mentioned in the Qur'an refers to actions.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلاَّ بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But they plot not except against themselves, and they perceive (it) not. <br /> <br />means, the harm of their wicked plots, as well as misguiding those whom they lead astray, will only strike them. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَيَحْمِلُنَّ أَثْقَالَهُمْ وَأَثْقَالاً مَّعَ أَثْقَالِهِمْ <br /> <br />And verily, they shall bear their own loads, and other loads besides their own. (29&#59;13) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ أَلَا سَأءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ <br /> <br />And also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear! (16&#59;25) <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 122" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">123</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>123</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 124" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-124/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=123;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
