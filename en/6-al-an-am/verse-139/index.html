When a sheep would give birth to a male sheep, they would slaughter it and feed it to their males, but not to their females. If the newly born lamb was a female, they would not slaughter it, but if it was stillborn, they would share in it (with their females)! Allah forbade this practice.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by As-Suddi. <br /> <br />Ash-Shabi said, <br /> <br />&#34;The <b>Bahirah's</b> milk was only given to the men. But if any cattle from the <b>Bahirah</b> died, both men and women would share in eating it.&#34; Similar was said by Ikrimah, Qatadah and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />Mujahid commented; <br />وَقَالُواْ مَا فِي بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الَانْعَامِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَى أَزْوَاجِنَا <br /> (And they say&#59;&#34;What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone, and forbidden to our females...&#34;), <br /> <br />&#34;It refers to the <b>Sa'ibah</b> and the <b>Bahirah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Al-Aliyah, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Allah's statement, <br />سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ <br /> (He will punish them for their attribution) means, <br /> <br />uttering such falsehood. <br /> <br />This is explained by Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَقُولُواْ لِمَا تَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُكُمُ الْكَذِبَ هَـذَا حَلَـلٌ وَهَـذَا حَرَامٌ لِّتَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br />And say not concerning that which your tongues falsely utter&#59;&#34;This is lawful and this is forbidden.&#34; so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper. (16&#59;116) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br /> إِنَّهُ حِكِيمٌ <br /> <br />Verily, He is All-Wise, <br /> <br />in His actions, statements, Law and decree. <br /> <br />عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Knower. <br /> <br />in the actions of His servants, whether good or evil, and He will recompense them for these deeds completely</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 138" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-138/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">139</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>139</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 140" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-140/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=139;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
