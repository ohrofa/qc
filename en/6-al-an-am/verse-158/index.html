On the Day when some of your Lord’s signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith unless it had believed previously, or had earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, we too are waiting.”</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>Are they waiting -- the deniers are indeed waiting -- for nothing less than that the angels should come to them (read ta'tyahum or ya'tyahum), to seize their souls, or that your Lord, that is, His command, meaning His chastisement, should come, or that one of your Lord's signs should come?, that is, those portents of His that indicate [the arrival of] the Hour? On the day that one of your Lord's signs comes -- and this is the rising of the sun from the west, as reported in the hadth of the two Sahhs [of Bukhr and Muslim] -- it shall not benefit a soul to believe if it had not believed theretofore (lam takun manat min qabl is an adjectival qualification of nafs, `a soul') or, a soul which had not [until then], earned in its belief some good, some [act of] obedience, that is to say, its repentance shall be of no benefit to it, as [stated] in the hadth [corpus]. Say&#59; `Wait, for one of these things, We too are waiting', for it.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Disbelievers Await the Commencement of the Hereafter, or Some of its Portents</b> <br /> <br />Allah sternly threatens the disbelievers, those who defy His Messengers, deny His <b>Ayat</b> and hinder from His path, <br /> <br />هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيهُمُ الْمَليِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ رَبُّكَ <br /> <br />Do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord (Allah) should come... <br /> <br />on the Day of Resurrection, <br /> <br />أَوْ يَأْتِيَ بَعْضُ ايَاتِ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ ايَاتِ رَبِّكَ لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا <br /> <br />or that some of the signs of your Lord should come! The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe then. <br /> <br />Before the commencement of the Day of Resurrection, there will come signs and portents of the Last Hour that will be witnessed by the people living at that time. <br /> <br />In a section explaining this <b>Ayah</b>, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا فَإِذَا رَاهَا النَّاسُ امَنَ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَذَلِكَ حِين <br /> <br />The Last Hour will not commence until the sun rises from the west. When the people witness that, they will all believe. This is when. <br /> <br />لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا <br /> <br />لَمْ تَكُنْ امَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />ثَلَثٌ إِذَا خَرَجْنَ لَا يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ امَنَتْ مِنْ قَبْل أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَالدَّجَّالُ وَدَابَّةُ الاَْرْض <br /> <br />Three, if they appear, then a soul will not benefit from its faith, if it had not believed before or earned good in its faith&#59;when the sun rises from the west, Ad-Dajjal and the Beast of the earth. <br /> <br />Ahmad also recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, and in his narration, the Prophet mentioned the Smoke. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;Three Muslim men sat with Marwan in Al-Madinah and they heard him talking about the signs (of the Last Hour). <br /> <br />He said that the first sign will be the appearance of Ad-Dajjal. So these men went to Abdullah bin `Amr and told him what they heard from Marwan about the signs. <br /> <br />Ibn `Amr said, Marwan said nothing. I remember that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, <br /> <br />إِنَّ أَوَّلَ الاْياتِ خُرُوجًا طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَخُرُوجُ الدَّابَّةِ ضُحًى فَأَيَّتُهُمَا كَانَتْ قَبْلَ صَاحِبَتِهَا فَالاُْخْرَى عَلَى أَثَرِهَا <br /> <br />The first of the signs to appear are the sun rising from the west and the Beast that appears in the early morning. Whichever comes before the other, then the second sign will appear soon after it.&#34; <br /> <br />Then Abdullah said - and he used to read the Scriptures - <br /> <br />&#34;And I think the first of them is the sun rising from the west. That is because when it sets it comes under the Throne, prostrates and seeks permission to return. So it is permitted to return until Allah wants it to rise from the west. So it does as it normally would, it comes beneath the Throne, it prostrates and seeks permission to return. But it will get no response. Then it will seek permission to return (again), but it will get no response, until what Allah wills of the night to pass goes by, and it realizes that if it is permitted to return it would not (be able to) reach the east. It says; `My Lord! The east is so far, what good would I be to the people' Until the horizons appear as a (lightless) ring, it seeks permission to return and is told; `Rise from your place,' so it rises upon the people from where it set.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he recited, <br /> <br />لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا <br /> <br />لَمْ تَكُنْ امَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim in his <b>Sahih</b>, and Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in their <b>Sunans</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا <br /> <br />لَمْ تَكُنْ امَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, <br /> <br />means, when the disbeliever believes then, it will not be accepted from him. As for those who were believers before, if they earned righteous deeds, they will have earned a great deal of good. If they had not done good nor repented before then, it will not be accepted from them, according to the <b>Hadiths</b> that we mentioned. <br /> <br />This is also the meaning of Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا <br />nor earned good through his faith. <br /> <br />meaning, one's good deeds will not be accepted from him unless he performed good deeds before. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />قُلِ انتَظِرُواْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Wait you! We (too) are waiting.&#34; <br /> <br />This is a stern threat to the disbelievers and a sure promise for those who delay embracing the faith and repenting until a time when faith or repentance shall not avail. This will occur when the sun rises from the west because the Last Hour will then be imminent and its major signs will have begun to appear. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَأءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّى لَهُمْ إِذَا جَأءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ <br /> <br />Do they then await (anything) other than the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly! But some of its portents have already come; and when it is upon them, how can they benefit then by their reminder! (47&#59;18) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَـفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَـنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا <br /> <br />So when they saw Our punishment, they said&#59;&#34;We believe in Allah alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as partners.&#34; Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment.
