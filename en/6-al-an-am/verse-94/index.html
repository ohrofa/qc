Therefore, this is the Day of Resurrection! <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَتَرَكْتُم مَّا خَوَّلْنَاكُمْ وَرَاء ظُهُورِكُمْ <br /> <br />You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you. <br /> <br />The wealth and the money that you collected in the life of the world, you left all this behind you. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Sahih that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />يَقُولُ ابْنُ ادَمَ مَالِي مَالِي وَهَلْ لَكَ مِنْ مَالِكَ إِلاَّ مَا أَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ وَمَا سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس <br /> <br />The Son of Adam says, `My money, my money!' But, what part of your money do you have, other than what you eat of it and is thus spent, what you wear and tear and what you gave in charity and thus remains (in the record of good deeds). Other than that, you will depart and leave it to the people. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, <br /> <br />&#34;On the Day of Resurrection, the Son of Adam will be brought, as if he were a golden chariot and Allah, the Most Honored, will ask, `Where is what you collected?' <br /> <br />He will reply, `O Lord! I collected it and left it as intact as ever.' <br /> <br />Allah will say to him, `O Son of Adam! Where is what you sent forth for yourself (of righteous, good deeds),' and he will realize that he did not send forth anything for himself.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan then recited the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ جِيْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُم مَّا خَوَّلْنَاكُمْ وَرَاء ظُهُورِكُمْ <br /> <br />And truly you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time. You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَمَا نَرَى مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَاءكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَاء <br /> <br />We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed to be your partners. <br /> <br />This chastises and criticizes the disbelievers for the rivals, idols and images that they worshipped in this life, thinking they will avail them in this life and upon Resurrection, if there is Resurrection, as they thought. On the Day of Resurrection, all relationships will be cut off, misguidance will be exposed, and those whom they used to call upon as gods will disappear from them. Allah will then call them, while the rest of creation is listening, <b> <br />أَيْنَ شُرَكَايِيَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ <br /></b> (Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert! (28&#59;62) <br /> <br />And, <br /> <br />وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ <br /> <br />مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ هَلْ يَنصُرُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَنتَصِرُونَ <br /> <br />And it will be said to them&#59;&#34;Where are those that you used to worship. Instead of Allah! Can they help you or help themselves!&#34; (26&#59;92-93) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br />وَمَا نَرَى مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَاءكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَاء <br /> (We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed were partners). <br /> <br />meaning partners in worship. That is, partners in a share of your worship. <br /> <br />لَقَد تَّقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ <br /> <br />Now you and they have been cut off, <br /> <br />or, the <b>Ayah</b> is recited with the meaning&#59;all connections, <br /> <br />means, and ties between you and them have been severed. <br /> <br />وَضَلَّ عَنكُم <br /> <br />and vanished from you, <br /> <br />you have lost, <br /> <br />مَّا كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />all that you used to claim) of hope in the benefit of the idols and rivals (you worshipped with Allah). <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ اللَّهُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ حَسَرَتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ <br /> <br />When those who were followed, declare themselves innocent of those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say&#59;&#34;If only we had one more chance to return, we would disown them as they have disowned us.&#34; <br /> <br />Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regret for them. And they will never get out of the Fire. (2&#59;166-167) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَيِذٍ وَلَا يَتَسَأءَلُونَ <br /> <br />Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another. (23&#59;101) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ <br /> <br />You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah, and the love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper. (29&#59;25) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَقِيلَ ادْعُواْ شُرَكَأءَكُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ <br /> <br />And it will be said (to them)&#59;&#34;Call upon your partners&#34;, and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them. (28&#59;64) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ <br /> <br />And the Day whereon We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who committed Shirk... (10&#59;28) until, <b> <br />وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم <br /> <br />مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ <br /></b> (And their invented false deities will vanish from them).
