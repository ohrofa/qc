My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember, this and believe?</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah says; <br /> <br />وَحَأجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ قَالَ <br /> <br />His people disputed with him. He said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah states that His <b>Khalil</b>, Prophet Ibrahim, said when his people mentioned various doubts and disputed with him about the <b>Tawhid</b> that he called to&#59; <br /> <br />أَتُحَاجُّونِّي فِي اللّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ <br /> <br />Do you dispute with me about Allah while He has guided me. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> means, do you argue with me about Allah, other than Whom there is no god worthy of worship, while He has guided me to the Truth and made me aware of it! Therefore, how can I ever consider your misguided statements and false doubts! <br /> <br />Ibrahim said next, <br /> <br />وَلَا أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَاء رَبِّي شَيْيًا <br /> <br />and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen to me) except when my Lord wills something. <br /> <br />Ibrahim said, among the proofs to the falsehood of your creed, is that these false gods that you worship do not bring about any effect, and I do not fear them or care about them. Therefore, if these gods are able to cause harm, then use them against me and do not give me respite. <br /> <br />Ibrahim's statement, <br />إِلاَّ أَن يَشَاء رَبِّي شَيْيًا <br /> (except when my Lord wills something), <br /> <br />means, only Allah causes benefit or harm. <br /> <br />وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا <br /> <br />My Lord comprehends in His knowledge all things. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah's knowledge encompasses all things and nothing escapes His complete observation. <br /> <br />أَفَلَ تَتَذَكَّرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Will you not then remember! <br /> <br />what I explained to you, considering your idols as false gods and refraining from worshipping them. <br /> <br />This reasoning from Prophet Ibrahim is similar to the argument that Prophet Hud used against his people, <b>`Ad</b>. Allah mentioned this incident in His Book, when He said, <br /> <br />قَالُواْ يَهُودُ مَا جِيْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِى ءالِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />إِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ ءَالِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّى أُشْهِدُ اللَّهِ وَاشْهَدُواْ أَنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ <br /> <br />مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِى جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ <br /> <br />إِنِّى تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّى وَرَبِّكُمْ مَّا مِن دَابَّةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ ءاخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَأ إِنَّ رَبِّى عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br />They said&#59;&#34;O Hud! No evidence have you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your (mere) saying! And we are not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods have seized you with evil.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;I call Allah to witness - and bear you witness - that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship with Him (Allah). So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He has grasp of its forelock.
