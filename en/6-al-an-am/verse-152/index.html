When any of that food or drink remained, they used to keep it for the orphan until he or she ate it or it spoiled. This became difficult for the companions and they talked about it to the Messenger of Allah, and Allah sent down the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَـمَى قُلْ إِصْلَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِن تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَنُكُمْ <br /> <br />And they ask you about orphans. Say&#59;&#34;The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.&#34; (2&#59;220) <br /> <br />Thereafter, they mixed their food and drink with food and drink of the orphans.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Dawud collected this statement. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ <br />(until he (or she) attains the age of full strength); <br /> <br />According to Ash-Sha`bi, Malik and several others among the <b>Salaf</b>, <br /> <br />refers to reaching the age of adolescence. <br /><b>The Command to Give Full Measure and Full Weight with Justice</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَأَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ <br /> <br />and give full measure and full weight with justice. <br /> <br />is a command to establish justice while giving and taking. <br /> <br />Allah has also warned against abandoning this commandment, when He said, <br /> <br />وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ <br /> <br />الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُواْ عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ <br /> <br />وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَوْ وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ <br /> <br />أَلا يَظُنُّ أُوْلَـيِكَ أَنَّهُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ <br /> <br />لِيَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ <br /> <br />يَوْمَ يَقُومُ النَّاسُ لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ <br /> <br />Woe to <b>Al-Mutaffifin</b>. Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure. And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due. Do they not think that they will be resurrected (for reckoning). On a Great Day The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists. (83&#59;1-6) <br /> <br />Allah destroyed an entire nation that was accustomed to giving less in weights and measures. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلااَّ وُسْعَهَا <br /> <br />We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. <br /> <br />that is, whoever strives while pursuing his rights and giving other peoples' full rights, then there is no sin on him if he commits an honest mistake after trying his best and striving to do what is right. <br /><b>The Order for Just Testimony</b> <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُواْ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى <br /> <br />And whenever you give your word, say the truth even if a near relative is concerned. <br /> <br />This is similar to His statement, <br /> <br />يَـأَيُّهَأ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ للَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah as just witnesses. (5&#59;8) <br /> <br />And there is a similar <b>Ayah</b> in Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b>. <br /> <br />So Allah commands justice in action and statement, with both near relatives and distant relatives. Indeed, Allah orders justice for everyone at all times and in all situations. <br /><b>Fulfilling the Covenant of Allah is an Obligation</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَبِعَهْدِ اللّهِ أَوْفُواْ <br /> <br />and fulfill the Covenant of Allah. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah commands&#59;Fulfill Allah's commandments that He has ordered you. You will do so when you obey Him in what He commanded, refrain from what He prohibited and abide by His Book and the <b>Sunnah</b> of His Messenger. This constitutes fulfilling the covenant of Allah. <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />This He commands you, that you may remember. <br /> <br />Allah says here, that this is what He has ordered and commanded, and He stressed its importance for you, <br />لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ <br /> (...that you may remember), that you may be advised and thus refrain from what you used to do before this.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 151" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-151/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">152</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>152</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 153" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-153/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
