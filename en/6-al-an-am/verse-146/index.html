Ibn Jurayj commented, <br /> <br />&#34;The fat on the rump that is mixed with the tailbone was allowed for them, and also the fat on the legs, head, eyes and what adheres to the bones.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said similarly. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ جَزَيْنَاهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ <br /> <br />Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion. <br /> <br />meaning, We imposed this restriction on them as recompense for their rebellion and defying Our commandments. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَـتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً <br /> <br />For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them -- and for their hindering many from Allah's way. (4&#59;160) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وِإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And verily, We are Truthful. <br /> <br />means, We were justified in the penalty We gave them. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented, <br /> <br />&#34;We are Truthful in what We informed you of, O Muhammad; Our forbidding these foods for them, not as they claimed, that Israel merely forbade these things for himself (so they imitated him, they claimed).&#34; <br /><b>The Tricks of the Jews, and Allah's Curse</b> <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Abbas narrated, <br /> <br />&#34;When Umar bin Al-Khattab was told that Samurah sold liquor, he commented, `May Allah fight Samurah! Did he not know that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّحُومُ فَجَمَلُوهَا فَبَاعُوهَا <br /> <br />May Allah curse the Jews! The fats were forbidden for them, so they melted the fat and sold it.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />Jabir bin Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;In the year of the victory of Makkah, I heard Allah's Messenger saying; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ حَرَّمَ بَيْعَ <br /> <br />الْخَمْرِ <br /> <br />وَالْمَيْتَةِ <br /> <br />وَالْخِنْزِيرِ <br /> <br />وَالاْاَصْنَام <br /> <br />Allah and His Messenger have forbidden selling <br /> <br />alcoholic drinks (intoxicants), <br /> <br />dead animals, <br /> <br />swine and <br /> <br />idols. <br /> <br />He was asked, `What about the fat of dead animal; they are used to dye skins, paint ships and are used as light by the people.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />لَاا هُوَ حَرَام <br /> <br />No, it is still unlawful. <br /> <br />He then said, <br /> <br />قَاتَلَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ إِنَّ اللهَ لَمَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهَا جَمَلُوهُ ثُمَّ بَاعُوهُ وَأَكَلُوا ثَمَنَه <br /> <br />May Allah fight the Jews! When Allah forbade them the fats of animals, they melted the fat, sold it and ate its price.&#34; <br /> <br />The Group recorded this <b>Hadith</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 145" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-145/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">146</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>146</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 147" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-147/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=146;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
