Say, to them&#59; `Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for mankind? You put it (in all three instances [the verbs may be] read either in the third person plural [yaj`alnahu, `they put it'; yubdnah, `they reveal it'; wa-yukhfna, `and they hide'] or in the second person plural [taj`alnahu, `you put it'; tubdnah, `you reveal it'; wa-tukhfna, `and you hide']) on parchments, that is, you write it down on fragments of notes, which you disclose, that is, what you choose to disclose thereof, but you hide much, of what is in them, as in [the case of] the descriptions of Muhammad (s); and you have been taught, O Jews, in the Qur'n, what you did not know, neither you nor your fathers', in the Torah, through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in disagreement over. Say&#59; `God', revealed it -- and if they do not say it, there is no other response -- then leave them to play in their discourse, their falsehood.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Messenger is but a Human to Whom the Book was Revealed by Inspiration</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَمَا قَدَرُواْ اللّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُواْ <br /> <br />They did not estimate Allah with an estimation due to Him when they said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah says that those who rejected His Messengers did not give Allah due consideration. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and Abdullah bin Kathir said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about the Quraysh. <br /> <br />It was also said that it was revealed about some Jews. <br /> <br />مَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ عَلَى بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />(They said)&#59;&#34;Nothing did Allah send down to any human being (by inspiration).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah also, said, <br /> <br />أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَأ إِلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ النَّاسَ <br /> <br />Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired to a man from among themselves (saying)&#59;&#34;Warn mankind.&#34; (10&#59;2) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَن يُوْمِنُواْ إِذْ جَأءَهُمُ الْهُدَى إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ أَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ بَشَرًا رَّسُولاً <br /> <br />قُل لَوْ كَانَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَلَـيِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَيِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ السَّمَأءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولاً <br /> <br />And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said&#59;&#34;Has Allah sent a man as Messenger!&#34; <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.&#34; (17&#59;94-95) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />وَمَا قَدَرُواْ اللّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُواْ مَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ عَلَى بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />They did not estimate Allah with an estimation due to Him when they said&#59;&#34;Nothing did Allah send down to any human being (by inspiration).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah answered them, <br /> <br />قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَابَ الَّذِي جَاء بِهِ مُوسَى نُورًا وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />Say &#59;&#34;Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to mankind!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, say, O Muhammad, to those who deny the concept that Allah sent down Books by revelation, answering them specifically, <br />مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَابَ الَّذِي جَاء بِهِ مُوسَى <br /> (Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought) in reference to the <b>Tawrah</b> that you and all others know that Allah sent down to Musa, son of Imran. <br /> <br />Allah sent the <b>Tawrah</b> as a light and a guidance for people, so that it could shed light on the answers to various disputes, and to guide away from the darkness of doubts. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيرًا <br /> <br />which you have made into (separate) paper sheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much). <br /> <br />means, you made the <b>Tawrah</b> into separate sheets which you copied from the original and altered, changed and distorted as you wished. You then said, &#34;this is from Allah,&#34; meaning it is in the revealed Book of Allah, when in fact, it is not from Allah. This is why Allah said here, <br />تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيرًا <br /> (which you have made into (separate) paper sheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much)). <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَعُلِّمْتُم مَّا لَمْ تَعْلَمُواْ أَنتُمْ وَلَا ابَاوُكُمْ <br /> <br />And you were taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew. <br /> <br />meaning, Who sent down the Qur'an in which Allah taught you the news of those who were before you and the news of what will come after, that neither you nor your fathers had knowledge of. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />قُلِ اللّهُ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Meaning, `Say, Allah sent it down.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِي خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then leave them to play in their vain discussions. <br /> <br />leave them to play in ignorance and misguidance until the true news comes to them from Allah. Then, they will know whether the good end is theirs or for the fearful servants of Allah. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 90" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-90/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">91</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>91</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 92" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-92/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
