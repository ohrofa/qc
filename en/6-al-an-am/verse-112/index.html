Therefore, do not be saddened by this fact. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُواْ عَلَى مَا كُذِّبُواْ وَأُوذُواْ <br /> <br />Verily, Messengers were denied before you, but with patience they bore the denial, and they were hurt... (6&#59;34) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />مَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةَ وَذُو عِقَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <br /> <br />Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you. Verily, your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness, and (also) the Possessor of painful punishment. (41&#59;43) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br />Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals. (25&#59;31) <br /> <br />Waraqah bin Nawfal said to Allah's Messenger, <br /> <br />&#34;None came with what you came with but he was the subject of enmity.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />شَيَاطِينَ الاِنس <br /> (<b>Shayatin</b> among mankind..., <br /> <br />refers to, <br />عَدُوًّا <br /> (enemies...), meaning, <br /> <br />the Prophets have enemies among the devils of mankind and the devils of the Jinns. <br /> <br />The word, <b>Shaytan</b>, describes one who is dissimilar to his kind due to his or her wickedness. Indeed, only the <b>Shayatin</b>, may Allah humiliate and curse them, from among mankind and the Jinns oppose the Messengers. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, <br />شَيَاطِينَ الاِنسِ وَالْجِنِّ <br /> (<b>Shayatin</b> (devils) among mankind and Jinn...), <br /> <br />&#34;There are devils among the Jinns and devils among mankind who inspire each other.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يُوحِي بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُورًا <br /> <br />inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion. <br /> <br />means, they inspire each other with beautified, adorned speech that deceives the ignorant who hear it. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء رَبُّكَ مَا فَعَلُوهُ <br /> <br />If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it; <br /> <br />for all this occurs by Allah's decree, will and decision, that every Prophet had enemies from these devils. <br /> <br />فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />so leave them alone with their fabrications, (and lies). <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> orders patience in the face of the harm of the wicked and to trust in Allah against their enmity, for, &#34;Allah shall suffice for you (O Muhammad) and aid you against them.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 111" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">112</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>112</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 113" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-113/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
