Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يعِيسَى إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَىَّ <br /> <br />And (remember) when Allah said&#59;&#34;O `Isa! I will take you and raise you to Myself...&#34; (3&#59;55) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />اللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى الاٌّنفُسَ حِينَ مِوْتِـهَا وَالَّتِى لَمْ تَمُتْ فِى مَنَامِـهَا فَيُمْسِكُ الَّتِى قَضَى عَلَيْهَا الْمَوْتَ وَيُرْسِلُ الاٍّخْرَى إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى <br /> <br />It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. (39&#59;42) <br /> <br />thus mentioning both minor and major death. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَتَوَفَّاكُم بِاللَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِالنَّهَارِ <br /> <br />It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, <br /> <br />meaning, He knows the deeds and actions that you perform during the day. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> demonstrates Allah's perfect knowledge of His creation, by day and night, and in their movements and idleness. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />سَوَاءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ <br /> <br />It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly, whether he be hid by night or go forth freely by day. (13&#59;10) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ <br /> <br />وَلِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ <br /> <br />It is out of His mercy that He made night and day, so that you may rest therein, (by night), and that you may seek of His bounty (by day). 28&#59;73) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا الَّيْلَ لِبَاساً <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا النَّهَارَ مَعَاشاً <br /> <br />And (We) have made the night as a covering. And (We) have made the day for livelihood. (78&#59;10-11) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَتَوَفَّاكُم بِاللَّيْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِالنَّهَارِ <br /> <br />It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, (6&#59;60) <br /> <br />Then said, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ <br /> <br />then he raises (wakes) you up again, <br /> <br />According to Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, <br /> <br />by day. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِيُقْضَى أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى <br /> <br />that a term appointed be fulfilled. <br /> <br />refers to the life span of every person, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ <br /> <br />then (in the end), unto Him will be your return. <br /> <br />on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ يُنَبِّيُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Then He will inform you of what you used to do. <br /> <br />He will reward you, good for good, and evil for evil. <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 59" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>60</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 61" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
