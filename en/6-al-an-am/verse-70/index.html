Remind them of Our revelation so that a soul will not bring about its own destruction because of its deeds. No one besides God will be its guardian or intercessor, nor will any kind of ransom be accepted from it. Those who have entangled themselves in their evil deeds will drink boiling water and live in painful torment for their hiding the Truth.</p></div><div id="qaribullah"><h3><span>19</span> Qaribullah & Darwish</h3><p>Avoid those who take their religion as playing and an amusement and are seduced by the life of this world.

Those are they who are taken for that which they earned. For them a drink of boiling water, a stern punishment for their disbelief.</p></div><div id="mubarakpuri"><h3><span>20</span> Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</h3><p>And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But remind (them) with it (the Qur'an) lest a soul Tubsal for that which one has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allah, and even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned.

Whatever ransom they may offer, it will not be accepted. Such are those that are damned by their own actions: they will have boiling water to drink and a painful punishment for their denial of truth.</p></div><div id="itani"><h3><span>22</span> Talal Itani</h3><p>So leave alone those who take their religion for play and pastime, and whom the worldly life has deceived.

Remind, admonish people, thereby, by the Qur'n, lest a soul perish, [lest] it be given up for destruction, for what it has earned, what it has done; it has no protector, [no] helper, besides God, other than Him, and no intercessor, to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation, [though] it pay every ransom, it shall not be accepted from it, that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement, because they disbelieved, that is, for their unbelief.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>Allah said, <br /> <br />وَذَرِ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُواْ دِينَهُمْ لَعِبًا وَلَهْوًا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> commands to leave such people, ignore them and give them respite, for soon, they will taste a tremendous torment. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />وَذَكِّرْ بِهِ <br /> <br />But remind with it, <br /> <br />meaning, remind the people with this Qur'an and warn them against Allah's revenge and painful torment on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />أَن تُبْسَلَ نَفْسٌ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ <br /> <br />lest a soul <b>Tubsal</b> for that which one has earned, <br /> <br />meaning, so that it is not <b>Tubsal</b>. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said that; <br /><b>Tubsal</b> means, be submissive. <br /> <br />Al-Walibi said that Ibn Abbas said that; <br /><b>Tubsal</b> means, `be exposed'. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that; <br /><b>Tubsal</b> means, `be prevented'. <br /> <br />Murrah and Ibn Zayd said that; <br /> <br />it means, `be recompensed'. <br /> <br />Al-Kalbi said, <br /> <br />`be reckoned'. <br /> <br />All these statements and expressions are similar, for they all mean exposure to destruction, being kept away from all that is good, and being restrained from attaining what is desired. <br /> <br />Allah also said; <br /> <br />كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ <br /> <br />Every person is restrained by what he has earned. Except those on the Right. (74&#59;38-39) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ اللّهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلَا شَفِيعٌ <br /> <br />when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allah. <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَإِن تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ لاَّ يُوْخَذْ مِنْهَا <br /> <br />and even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him. <br /> <br />meaning, whatever the ransom such people offer, it will not be accepted from them. <br /> <br />Allah said in a similar statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ الاٌّرْضِ ذَهَبًا <br /> <br />Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them. (3&#59;91) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ الَّذِينَ أُبْسِلُواْ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful torment because they used to disbelieve</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 69" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-69/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">70</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>70</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 71" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-71/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
