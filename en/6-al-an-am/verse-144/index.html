Say&#59; `Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses, present, when God charged you with this?, prohibition, such that you use it to support your claims? Nay! You speak lies in this [matter]. Then who, that is, none, does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, in this matter, that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَمِنَ الاِبْلِ اثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ اثْنَيْنِ قُلْ الذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ الاُنثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا اشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ الاُنثَيَيْنِ <br /> <br />And of the camels two, and of oxen two. Say&#59;&#34;Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose! <br /> <br /> أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَاء إِذْ وَصَّاكُمُ اللّهُ بِهَـذَا <br /> <br />Or, were you present when Allah ordered you such a thing! <br /> <br />mocking the idolators' innovations, and their lies that Allah made sacred what they have prohibited. <br /> <br />فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللّهِ كَذِبًا لِيُضِلَّ النَّاسَ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ <br /> <br />Then who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. <br /> <br />Therefore, no one is more unjust than the people described here and <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers. <br /> <br />The person most worthy of this condemnation is `Amr bin Luhay bin Qum`ah. He was the first person to change the religion of the Prophets and designate the <b>Sa'ibah</b>, <b>Wasilah</b> and <b>Ham</b>, as mentioned in the <b>Sahih</b></p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 143" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-143/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">144</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>144</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 145" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-145/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=144;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
