(11&#59;27) <br /> <br />Heraclius, emperor of Rome, asked Abu Sufyan, &#34;Do the noblemen or the weak among people follow him (Muhammad)?&#34; <br />Abu Sufyan replied, &#34;Rather the weak among them.&#34; <br /> <br />Heraclius commented, &#34;Such is the case with followers of the Messengers.&#34; <br /> <br />The idolators of Quraysh used to mock the weak among them who believed in the Prophet and they even tortured some of them. They used to say, &#34;Are these the ones whom Allah favored above us,&#34; meaning, Allah would not guide these people, instead of us, to all that is good, if indeed what they embraced is good. <br /> <br />Allah mentioned similar statements in the Qur'an from the disbelievers, <br /> <br />لَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَأ إِلَيْهِ <br /> <br /> <br />Had it been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it! (46&#59;11) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا بِيِّنَـتٍ قَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَىُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ خَيْرٌ مَّقَاماً وَأَحْسَنُ نَدِيّاً <br /> <br />And when Our clear verses are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe&#59;&#34;Which of the two groups is best in position and station.&#34; (19&#59;73) <br /> <br />Allah said in reply, <br /> <br />وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَحْسَنُ أَثَاثاً وَرِءْياً <br /> <br />And how many a generation (past nations) have We destroyed before them, who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance. (19&#59;74) <br /> <br />Here, Allah answered the disbelievers when they said, <br /> <br />أَهَـوُلاء مَنَّ اللّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَا <br /> <br />أَلَيْسَ اللّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِالشَّاكِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;Is it these (poor believers) that Allah has favored from amongst us!&#34; Does not Allah know best those who are grateful! <br /> <br />Meaning is not Allah more knowledgeable of those who thank and appreciate Him in statement, action and heart! <br /> <br />Thus Allah directs these believers to the ways of peace, transfers them from darkness to light by His leave, and guides them to the straight path. <br /> <br />In another <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ جَـهَدُواْ فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ <br /> <br />As for those who strive hard for Us (Our cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allah's religion). And verily, Allah is with the doers of good.&#34; (29&#59;69) <br />An authentic <b>Hadith</b> states, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَلَا إِلَى أَلْوَانِكُمْ وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُم <br /> <br />Allah does not look at your shapes or colors, but He looks at your heart and actions.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 52" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-52/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">53</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>53</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 54" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-54/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=53;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
