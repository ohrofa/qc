He is never questioned about what He does, but they all will be questioned. <br /> <br />فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So leave them alone with their fabrications. <br /> <br />meaning, avoid and abandon them and what they do, for Allah will judge between you and them</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Al-An&#39;am Verse 136" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-136/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">137</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>137</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Al-An&#39;am Verse 138" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-138/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=6,sura_dir="al-an-am",count_ayat=165,number_aya=137;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme-en.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
