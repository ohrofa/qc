Had God willed, they would not have done so; so leave them and that which they fabricate.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Shaytan Lured the Idolators to Kill Their Children</b> <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَادِهِمْ شُرَكَأوُهُمْ لِيُرْدُوهُمْ وَلِيَلْبِسُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ <br /> <br />And so to many of the idolators, their &#34;partners&#34; have made fair seeming the killing of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. <br /> <br />Allah says, just as the <b>Shayatin</b> lured the idolators to assign a share for Allah from what He created of agriculture and cattle - and a share for the idols, they also made it seem fair for them to kill their children, for fear of poverty, and burying their daughters alive, for fear of dishonor. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas that he commented; <br />وَكَذَلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَادِهِمْ شُرَكَأوُهُمْ <br />(And so to many of the idolators, their &#34;partners&#34; have made fair seeming the killing of their children...). <br /> <br />&#34;They make killing their children attractive to them.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Idolators' partners among the devils ordered them to bury their children for fear of poverty.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;The devils commanded them to kill their daughters so that they, <br />لِيُرْدُوهُمْ <br />(lead them to their own destruction), and to, <br />وَلِيَلْبِسُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ <br /> (cause confusion in their religion).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ مَا فَعَلُوهُ <br /> <br />And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. <br /> <br />meaning, all this occurred by Allah's leave, will and decree, but He dislikes these practices, and He has the perfect wisdom in every decree. He is never questioned about what He does, but they all will be questioned. <br /> <br />فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So leave them alone with their fabrications. <br /> <br />meaning, avoid and abandon them and what they do, for Allah will judge between you and them</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 136" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-136/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأنعام<span class="num-ar">6</span> :<span class="num-ar">137</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-An'am<span> 6</span>:<span>137</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-An&#39;am Verse 138" href="/en/6-al-an-am/verse-138/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
