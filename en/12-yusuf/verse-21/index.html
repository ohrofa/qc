He also ordered his wife to be kind to Yusuf and had good hopes for his future, because of his firm righteous behavior. <br /> <br />He said to his wife, <br /> <br />أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ عَسَى أَن يَنفَعَنَا أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَدًا <br /> <br />Make his stay comfortable, maybe he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son. <br /> <br />The man who bought Yusuf was the minister of Egypt at the time, and his title was <b>Aziz</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Ubaydah said that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;Three had the most insight&#59; <br /> <br />the <b>Aziz</b> of Egypt, who said to his wife, <br />أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ <br /> (Make his stay comfortable...), <br /> <br />the woman who said to her father, <br />يَا أَبَتِ اسْتَأْجِرْهُ <br /> (O my father!
