And We revealed to him, in the well, through true revelation (wahy haqqa) -- he was 17 years of age or just under -- in order to reassure his heart&#59; `Truly you shall inform them, after this day, of this affair, [this] deed, of theirs when they are unaware', of [who] you [are] (wa-hum l yash`urna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the action of `informing').</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>Yusuf is thrown in a Well</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا ذَهَبُواْ بِهِ <br /> <br />when they took him away, <br /> <br />Allah says that when Yusuf's brothers took him from his father, after they requested him to permit that, <br /> <br />وَأَجْمَعُواْ أَن يَجْعَلُوهُ فِي غَيَابَةِ الْجُبِّ <br /> <br />they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well, <br /> <br />This part of the <b>Ayah</b> magnifies their crime, in that it mentions that they all agreed to throw him to the bottom of the well. This was their intent, yet when they took him from his father, they pretended otherwise, so that his father sends him with a good heart and feeling at ease and comfortable with his decision. <br /> <br />It was reported that Yaqub, peace be upon him, embraced Yusuf, kissed him and supplicated to Allah for him when he sent him with his brothers. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that; <br /> <br />the time spent between pretending to be well-wishers and harming Yusuf was no longer than their straying far from their father's eyes. <br /> <br />They then started abusing Yusuf verbally, by cursing, and harming him by beating. When they reached the well that they agreed to throw him in, they tied him with rope and lowered him down. When Yusuf would beg one of them, he would smack and curse him. When he tried to hold to the sides of the well, they struck his hand and then cut the rope when he was only half the distance from the bottom of the well. He fell into the water and was submerged. However, he was able to ascend a stone that was in the well and stood on it. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَأَوْحَيْنَأ إِلَيْهِ لَتُنَبِّيَنَّهُم بِأَمْرِهِمْ هَـذَا وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and We revealed to him&#59;&#34;Indeed, you shall (one day) inform them of this their affair, when they know (you) not.&#34; <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah mentions His mercy and compassion and His compensation and relief that He sends in times of distress. Allah revealed to Yusuf, during that distressful time, in order to comfort his heart and strengthen his resolve, `Do not be saddened by what you have suffered. Surely, you will have a way out of this distress and a good end, for Allah will aid you against them, elevate your rank and raise your grade. Later on, you will remind them of what they did to you.' <br /> <br />وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />when they know not. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;You will remind them of this evil action against you, while they are unaware of your identity and unable to recognize you.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 14" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-14/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">15</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>15</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 16" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-16/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
