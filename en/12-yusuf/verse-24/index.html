But if he commits it, then write it as one evil deed.' <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> using various wording, this is one of them. <br /> <br />It was also reported that the <b>Ayah</b> means that; <br /> <br />Yusuf was about to beat her. <br /> <br />As for the evidence that Yusuf saw at that moment, there are conflicting opinions to what it was. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir At-Tabari said, <br /> <br />&#34;The correct opinion is that we should say that he saw an <b>Ayah</b> from among Allah's <b>Ayat</b> that repelled the thought that crossed his mind. This evidence might have been the image of Yaqub, or the image of an angel, or a divine statement that forbade him from doing that evil sin, etc.There are no clear proofs to support any of these statements in specific, so it should be left vague, as Allah left it. <br /> <br />Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوءَ وَالْفَحْشَاء <br /> <br />Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and immoral sins. <br /> <br />means, `Just as We showed him the evidence that turned him away from that sin, We save him from all types of evil and illegal sexual activity in all his affairs,' <br /> <br />because, <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا الْمُخْلَصِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, he was one of Our <b>Mukhlasin</b> servants. <br /> <br />meaning, chosen, purified, designated, appointed and righteous. May Allah's peace and blessings be on him.</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 23" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-23/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">24</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>24</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 25" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-25/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=12,sura_dir="yusuf",count_ayat=111,number_aya=24;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
