The Messengers did not suspect their Lord of such a thing.' <br /> <br />I asked, `So what does this <b>Ayah</b> mean?' <br /> <br />She said, <br /> <br />`This Verse is concerned with the Messengers' followers who had faith in their Lord and believed in their Messengers. The period of trials for those followers was long and Allah's help was delayed until the Messengers gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah's help then came to them.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj narrated that Ibn Abi Mulaikah said that Ibn Abbas read this <b>Ayah</b> this way, <br /> <br />وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ <br /> <br />and they thought they were denied. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Then Ibn Abbas said to me that they were humans. He then recited this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَى نَصْرُ اللَّهِ أَلَا إِنَّ نَصْرَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ <br />even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, &#34;When (will come) the help of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />Yes! Certainly, the help of Allah is near! (2&#59;214)&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj also narrated that Ibn Abi Mulaykah said that Urwah narrated to him that; <br /> <br />Aishah did not agree to this and rejected it. She said, <br /> <br />&#34;Nothing that Allah has promised Muhammad, peace be upon him, but Muhammad knew for certainty that it shall come, until he died. However, the Messengers were tried with trials until they thought that those believers, who were with them, did not fully support them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Mulaykah said that Urwah narrated that Aishah recited this <b>Ayah</b> this way, <br /> <br />وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذَّبُواْ <br /> <br />and they thought that they were betrayed. <br /> <br />Therefore, there is another way of reciting this word, and there is a difference of opinion about its meaning. <br /> <br />We narrated the meaning that Ibn Abbas gave. <br /> <br />Ibn Mas`ud said, as Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from him, that he read the <b>Ayah</b> this way, <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ <br /> <br />until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied. <br /> <br />Abdullah commented that this is the recitation that you dislike. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas also commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ <br /> (until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied), <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messengers gave up hope that their people would accept their messages, and their people thought that their Messengers had not said the truth to them, Allah's victory came then, <br />فَنُجِّيَ مَن نَّشَاء <br /> (and whomsoever We willed were rescued). <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir At-Tabari narrated that Ibrahim bin Abi Hamzah (Hurrah) Al-Jazari said, <br /> <br />&#34;A young man from Quraysh asked Sa'id bin Jubayr `O, Abu Abdullah! How do you read this word, for when I pass by it, I wish I had not read this <b>Surah</b>, <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ <br /> <br /> <br />until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied... <br /> <br />He said, `Yes, it means, when the Messengers gave up hope that their people will believe in them and those to whom the Messengers were sent thought that the Messengers were not truthful.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim commented, <br /> <br />&#34;I have not seen someone who is called to knowledge and is lazy accepting the invitation, until today! If you traveled to Yemen just to get this explanation, it will still be worth it.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir At-Tabari narrated that; <br /> <br />Muslim bin Yasar asked Sa`id bin Jubayr about the same <b>Ayah</b> and he gave the same response. Muslim stood up and embraced Sa'id bin Jubayr, saying, &#34;May Allah relieve a distress from you as you relieved a distress from me!&#34; <br /> <br />This was reported from Sa'id bin Jubayr through various chains of narration. <br /> <br />This is also the <b>Tafsir</b> that Mujahid bin Jabr and several other <b>Salaf</b> scholars gave for this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />However, some scholars said that the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ <br /> (and thought that they were denied), <br /> <br />is in reference to the believers who followed the Messengers, while some said it is in reference to the disbelievers among the Messengers' nation. In the latter case, the meaning becomes&#59; <br /> <br />`and the disbelievers thought that the Messengers were not given a true promise of victory.' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir At-Tabari narrated that Tamim bin Hadhlam said that I heard Abdullah bin Mas`ud comment on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ <br /> (until, when the Messengers gave up hope), <br /> <br />&#34;their people will believe in them, and their people thought when the respite was long, that the Messengers were not given a true promise.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 109" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-109/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">110</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>110</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 111" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-111/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
