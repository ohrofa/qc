He realized the virtue of Prophet Yusuf, recognized his knowledge in the interpretation of dreams and valued his good conduct with his subjects in his country. <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الْمَلِكُ ايْتُونِي بِهِ <br /> <br />The king said&#59;&#34;Bring him to me. <br /> <br />`Release him from prison and bring him to me.' <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاءهُ الرَّسُولُ قَالَ ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ <br /> <br />But when the messenger came to him, (Yusuf) said&#59;&#34;Return to your king, <br /> <br />When the king's emissary came to Yusuf and conveyed the news of his imminent release, Yusuf refused to leave the prison until the king and his subjects declare his innocence and the integrity of his honor, denouncing the false accusation that the wife of the Aziz made against him.

He wished to have powerful support! If I were to stay in prison for such a long time as Yusuf did, I would have accepted the offer. <br /> <br />In another narration collected by Ahmad from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said about Yusuf's statement, <br /> <br />فَاسْأَلْهُ مَا بَالُ النِّسْوَةِ اللَّتِي قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ إِنَّ رَبِّي بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;...and ask him, `What happened to the women who cut their hands Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.&#34;' <br /> <br />لَوْ كُنْتُ أَنَا لَاَسْرَعْتُ الاِْجَابَةَ وَمَا ابْتَغَيْتُ الْعُذْر <br /> <br />If it was me, I would have accepted the offer rather than await my exoneration first. <br /> <br />Allah said (that the king asked)</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 49" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">50</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>50</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 51" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-51/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
