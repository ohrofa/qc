(72&#59;13) <br /> <br />meaning that Yusuf's brothers exchanged him for a miserably low price. Yet, he was so insignificant to them that had the caravan people wanted him for free, they would have given him for free to them! <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak said that, <br /> <br />وَشَرَوْهُ <br /> (And they sold him), is in reference to Yusuf's brothers. They sold Yusuf for the lowest price, as indicated by Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ <br /> (for a few Dirhams), <br /> <br />twenty Dirhams, according to Abdullah bin Mas`ud. <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ibn Abbas, Nawf Al-Bikali, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Atiyah Al-Awfi, who added that they divided the Dirhams among themselves, each getting two Dirhams. <br /> <br />وَكَانُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ الزَّاهِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And they were of those who regarded him insignificant. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />&#34;Because they had no knowledge of his Prophethood and glorious rank with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 19" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-19/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">20</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>20</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 21" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-21/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
