They said, `We never dreamed a thing!'; he said, decided, concluded, is the matter regarding which you sought opinion', about which you enquired, whether you spoke truthfully or were lying.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Interpretation of the Dreams</b> <br /> <br />When Yusuf finished calling them, he started interpreting their dreams for them, Yusuf said, <br /> <br />يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَمَّا أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِي رَبَّهُ خَمْرًا <br /> <br />O two companions of the prison! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his master to drink; <br /> <br />to the man who saw in a dream that he was pressing wine. He did not direct this speech at him, however, so that to lessen the grief of the other person. <br /> <br />This is why he made his statement indirect, <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا الاخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِن رَّأْسِهِ <br /> <br />and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. <br /> <br />which is the interpretation of the other man's dream in which he saw himself carrying bread above his head. <br /> <br />Yusuf told them that the decision about their matter has already been taken and it shall come to pass. This is because the dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not truthfully interpreted. If it is interpreted, then it becomes a reality. <br /> <br />Ath-Thawri said that Imarah bin Al-Qa`qa` narrated that Ibrahim said that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;When they said what they said to him, and he explained their dreams to them, they replied, `We did not see anything at all.' This is when he said, <br /> <br />قُضِيَ الَامْرُ الَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.&#34; <br /> <br />The understanding in this is that he who claims that he saw a dream and was given its interpretation, then he will be tied to its interpretation, and Allah has the best knowledge. <br /> <br />There is an honorable <b>Hadith</b> that Imam Ahmad collected from Mu`awiyah bin Haydah that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />الرُّوْيَا عَلَى رِجْلِ طَايِرٍ مَا لَمْ تُعْبَرْ فَإِذَا عُبِرَتْ وَقَعَت <br /> <br />The dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not interpreted. If it is interpreted, it becomes a reality</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 40" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-40/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">41</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>41</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 42" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-42/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
