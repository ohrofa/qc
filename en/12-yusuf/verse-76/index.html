There is an all-knowing above every person endowed with knowledge.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas responded, `Worse it is that which you said! Allah is the All-Knowing and His knowledge is above the knowledge of every knowledgeable person.' <br /> <br />Simak narrated that Ikrimah said that Ibn Abbas said about Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /></b> (but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;This person has more knowledge than that person, and Allah is above all knowledgeable persons.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was narrated from Ikrimah. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Over every person endowed with knowledge is a more knowledgeable person until all knowledge ends with Allah.
