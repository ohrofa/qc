In this way We devised a plan for Joseph- if God had not willed it so, he could not have detained his brother as a penalty under the king’s law- We raise the rank of whoever We will.

Then he brought forth the drinking-cup from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive to support Joseph.

Over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing.</p></div><div id="ahmedraza"><h3><span>7</span> Ahmed Raza Khan</h3><p>So he first searched their bags before his brother’s bag, then removed it from his brother’s bag; this was the plan We had taught Yusuf; he had no right to take his brother by the king’s law, except if Allah wills; We may raise in ranks whomever We will; and above every possessor of knowledge is another scholar.</p></div><div id="qarai"><h3><span>8</span> Ali Quli Qarai</h3><p>Then he began with their sacks, before [opening] his brother’s sack.

That is how We contrived for Joseph (to keep Benjamin with him, otherwise) he could not have taken his brother according to the king´s law. Yet it came about as Allâh willed.

Then he pulled it out of his brother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Joseph; he could not have detained his brother under the king’s law, unless God so willed. We elevate by degrees whomever We will; and above every person of knowledge, there is one more learned.</p></div><div id="jalalayn"><h3><span>23</span> Tafsir jalalayn</h3><p>And so he began with their sacks, and searched them, before his brother's sack, lest he be accused [of the theft]; then he pulled it, the drinking-cup, out of his brother's sack. God, exalted be He, says&#59; Thus, [through such] contrivance, did We contrive for Joseph, [thus] We taught him how to devise a plot to take his brother; he, Joseph, could not have taken his brother, as a slave, on account of theft, according to the king's law, [according] to the laws of the king of Egypt -- since his [a thief's] requital according to his law would have been a beating and a penalty of twice [the value of] the stolen item, but not enslavement -- unless God willed, for him to be taken according to the law of his father [Jacob]; in other words, he was only able to take him with God's will, by God's inspiring him to ask his brothers [about the nature of requital] and their responding according to [what is decreed by] their customary practice. We raise by degrees whom We will (read with a genitive annexation, darajti man nash', or [simply] with nunation, darajtin man nash'), in terms of knowledge, as [We did] with Joseph; and above every man of knowledge, from among creatures, is one who knows better, better than him [and so on] until it ends with God, exalted be He.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَاء أَخِيهِ <br /> <br />So he (Yusuf) began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اسْتَخْرَجَهَا مِن وِعَاء أَخِيهِ <br /> <br />Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. <br /> <br />Therefore, Yusuf took Binyamin as a slave according to their judgement and the law which they believed in. <br /> <br />So Allah said; <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ كِدْنَا لِيُوسُفَ <br /> <br />Thus did We plan for Yusuf. <br /> <br />and this is a good plot that Allah likes and prefers, because it seeks a certain benefit using wisdom and the benefit of all. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِي دِينِ الْمَلِكِ <br /> <br />He could not take his brother by the law of the king, <br /> <br />as a captive, for this was not the law of king of Egypt, according to Ad-Dahhak and several other scholars. <br /> <br />Allah only allowed Yusuf to take his brother as a captive after his brothers agreed to this judgement beforehand, and he knew that this was their law. <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن يَشَاء اللّهُ <br /> <br />except that Allah willed it. <br /> <br />This is why Allah praised him when He said, <br /> <br />نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مِّن نَّشَاء <br /> <br />We raise to degrees whom We will, <br /> <br />just as He said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe. (58&#59;11) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan commented, <br /> <br />&#34;There is no knowledgeable person, but there is another person with more knowledge until it ends at Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.&#34; <br /> <br />In addition, Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, that we were with Ibn Abbas when he narrated an amazing <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />A man in the audience said, `All praise is to Allah! There is an all-knowing above every person endowed with knowledge.' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas responded, `Worse it is that which you said! Allah is the All-Knowing and His knowledge is above the knowledge of every knowledgeable person.' <br /> <br />Simak narrated that Ikrimah said that Ibn Abbas said about Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /></b> (but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;This person has more knowledge than that person, and Allah is above all knowledgeable persons.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was narrated from Ikrimah. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Over every person endowed with knowledge is a more knowledgeable person until all knowledge ends with Allah. Verily, knowledge started from Allah, and from Him the scholars learn, and to Him all knowledge returns.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud read the Ayah this way, <br /> <br />(<b> <br />وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ عاَلِمٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /></b>) &#34;And above every scholar, is the All-Knower (Allah).</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 75" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-75/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">76</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>76</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 77" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
