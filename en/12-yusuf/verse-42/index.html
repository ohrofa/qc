So (Yusuf) stayed in prison a few (more) years. <br /> <br />Yusuf knew that the distiller would be saved. So discretely, so that the other man's suspicion that he would be crucified would not intensify, he said, <br />اذْكُرْنِي عِندَ رَبِّكَ <br /> (Mention me to your King), asking him to mention his story to the king. <br /> <br />That man forgot Yusuf's request and did not mention his story to the king, a plot from the devil, so that Allah's Prophet would not leave the prison. This is the correct meaning of, <br />فَأَنسَاهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ <br /> (But <b>Shaytan</b> made him forget to mention it to his master), <br /> <br />that it refers to the man who was saved. <br /> <br />As was said by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. <br /> <br />As for, `a few years', or, <b>Bida`</b> in Arabic, <br /> <br />it means between three and nine, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. <br /> <br />Wahb bin Munabbih said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ayub suffered from the illness for seven years, Yusuf remained in prison for seven years and Bukhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar - Chaldean king of Babylon) was tormented for seven years.&#34;</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 41" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-41/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">42</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>42</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 43" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
