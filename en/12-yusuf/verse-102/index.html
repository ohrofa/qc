We taught you all this through Our Revelation which We sent down to you.' <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلَـمَهُمْ <br /> <br />You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens. <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَأ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ <br /> <br />And you were not on the western side, when We made clear to Musa the commandment... (28&#59;44) until, <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنْتَ بِجَانِبِ الطُّورِ إِذْ نَادَيْنَا <br /> <br />And you were not at the side of the <b>Tur</b> when We did call. (28&#59;46) <br /> <br />Allah also said, <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ ثَاوِياً فِى أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا <br /> <br />And you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting Our verses to them. (28&#59;45) <br /> <br />Allah states that Muhammad is His Messenger and that He has taught him the news of what occurred in the past, which carry lessons for people to draw from, so that they acquire their safety in their religious affairs as well as their worldly affairs. Yet, most people did not and will not believe, so Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُوْمِنِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 101" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-101/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">102</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>102</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 103" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-103/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
