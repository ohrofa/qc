Do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates, <br /> <br />Allah says that Yaqub, peace be upon him, ordered his children, when he sent Binyamin with them to Egypt, to enter from different gates rather than all of them entering from one gate. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak Qatadah, As-Suddi and several others said that; <br /> <br />he feared the evil eye for them, because they were handsome and looked beautiful and graceful. He feared that people might direct the evil eye at them, because the evil eye truly harms, by Allah's decree, and brings down the mighty warrior-rider from his horse. <br /> <br />He next said, <br /> <br />وَمَا أُغْنِي عَنكُم مِّنَ اللّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />and I cannot avail you against Allah at all. <br /> <br />this precaution will not resist Allah's decision and appointed decree. <br /> <br />Verily, whatever Allah wills, cannot be resisted or stopped, <br /> <br />إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ لِلّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 66" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-66/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">67</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>67</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 68" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-68/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=12,sura_dir="yusuf",count_ayat=111,number_aya=67;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
