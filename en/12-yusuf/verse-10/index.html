Allah willed Yusuf to be a powerful man in Egypt and govern it. <br /> <br />Consequently, Allah did not allow them to persist in their intent against Yusuf, through Rubil's words and his advice to them that if they must do something, they should throw him down to the bottom of a well, <br /> <br />يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ السَّيَّارَةِ <br /> <br />he will be picked up by some caravan, <br /> <br />of travelers passing by. This way, he said, you will rid yourselves of this bother without having to kill him, <br /> <br />إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />if you must do something, <br /> <br />meaning, if you still insist on getting rid of him. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, <br /> <br />&#34;They agreed to a particularly vicious crime that involved cutting the relation of the womb, undutiful treatment of parents, and harshness towards the young, helpless and sinless. <br /> <br />It was also harsh towards the old and weak who have the rights of being respected, honored and appreciated, as well as, being honored with Allah and having parental rights on their offspring. They sought to separate the beloved father, who had reached old age and his bones became weak, yet had a high status with Allah, from his beloved young son, in spite of his weakness, tender age and his need of his father's compassion and kindness. <br /> <br />May Allah forgive them, and indeed, He is the Most Merciful among those who have mercy, for they intended to carry out a &#34;grave error.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim collected this statement, from the route of Salamah bin Al-Fadl from Muhammad bin Ishaq</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 9" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">10</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>10</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 11" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
