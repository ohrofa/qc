So patience is most fitting (for me). <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said, <br /> <br />&#34;When they went back to Yaqub and told him what happened, he did not believe them and thought that this was a repetition of what they did to Yusuf. So he said, <br />بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ <br /> (Nay, but your own selves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me). <br /> <br />Some said that; since this new development came after what they did before (to Yusuf), they were given the same judgement to this later incident that was given to them when they did what they did (to Yusuf). Therefore, Yaqub's statement here is befitting, <br />بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْرًا فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ <br />(Nay, but your own selves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me). He then begged Allah to bring back his three sons&#59;Yusuf, Binyamin and Rubil to him.&#34; <br /> <br />Rubil had remained in Egypt awaiting Allah's decision about his case, either his father's permission ordering him to go back home, or to secure the release of his brother in confidence. This is why Yaqub said, <br /> <br />عَسَى اللّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَنِي بِهِمْ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَلِيمُ <br /> <br />May be Allah will bring them (back) all to me. Truly, He! Only He is All-Knowing, <br /> <br />in my distress, <br /> <br />الْحَكِيمُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />the All-Wise, <br /> <br />in His decisions and the decree and preordainment He appoints. <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 82" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-82/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">83</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>83</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 84" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-84/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=12,sura_dir="yusuf",count_ayat=111,number_aya=83;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
