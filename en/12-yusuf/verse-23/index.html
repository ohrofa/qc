She called him to do an evil act with her, because she loved him very much. Yusuf was very handsome, filled with manhood and beauty. She beautified herself for him, closed the doors and called him, <br /> <br />وَقَالَتْ هَيْتَ لَكَ <br /> <br />and (she) said&#59;&#34;Come on, O you.&#34; <br /> <br />But he categorically refused her call, <br /> <br />قَالَ مَعَاذَ اللّهِ إِنَّهُ رَبِّي أَحْسَنَ مَثْوَايَ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;I seek refuge in Allah! Truly, he is my <b>Rabb</b>! He made my living in a great comfort!&#34; <br /> <br />as they used to call the chief and master a <b>`Rabb'</b>, Yusuf said to her, `your husband is my master who provided me with comfortable living and was kind to me, so I will never betray him by committing immoral sins with his wife,' <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الظَّالِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, the wrongdoers will never be successful. <br /> <br />This was said by Mujahid, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. <br /> <br />The scholars differ in their recitation of, <br />هَيْتَ لَكَ <br /> (<b>Hayta Laka</b>), whereby Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and several other scholars said that it means that; <br /> <br />she was calling him to herself. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said; &#34;Ikrimah said that, <br />هَيْتَ لَكَ <br /> (<b>Hayta Laka'</b>) means, <br /> <br />`come on, O you', in the Aramaic language.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari collected this statement from Ikrimah without a chain of narration. <br /> <br />Other scholars read it with the meaning, <br /> <br />`I am ready for you'. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Abu Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami, Abu Wa'il, Ikrimah and Qatadah were reported to have read this part of the <b>Ayah</b> this way and explained it in the manner we mentioned, as `I am ready for you'</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 22" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> يوسف<span class="num-ar">12</span> :<span class="num-ar">23</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Yusuf<span> 12</span>:<span>23</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Yusuf Verse 24" href="/en/12-yusuf/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
