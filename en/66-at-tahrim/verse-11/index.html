Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />لااَّ يَتَّخِذِ الْمُوْمِنُونَ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَأءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَىْءٍ إِلَا أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـةً <br /> <br />Let not the believers take the disbelievers as protecting friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way, except you indeed fear a danger from them. (3&#59;28) <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Fir`awn was the most tyrannical among the people of the earth and the most disbelieving. By Allah! His wife was not affected by her husband's disbelief, because she obeyed her Lord. Therefore, let it be known that Allah is the Just Judge Who will not punish anyone except for their own sins.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Sulayman said, <br /> <br />&#34;The wife of Fir`awn was tortured under the sun and when Fir`awn would finish the torture session, the angels would shade her with their wings. She was shown her house in Paradise.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said that Al-Qasim bin Abi Bazzah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Fir`awn's wife used to ask, `Who prevailed?' <br /> <br />When she was told, `Musa and Harun prevailed', she said, `I believe in the Lord of Musa and Harun.' <br /> <br />Fir`awn sent his aides to her and said to them, `Find the biggest stone. If she insists on keeping her faith, throw the stone on her, otherwise she is my wife. <br /> <br />When they came to her, she looked up to the sky and was able to see her house in Paradise. She persisted on the faith and her soul was then captured. The stone was thrown on her lifeless body.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the meaning of her statement, <br /> <br />رَبِّ ابْنِ لِي عِندَكَ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ <br /> <br />وَنَجِّنِي مِن فِرْعَوْنَ وَعَمَلِهِ <br /> <br /> <br />My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Fir`awn and his work, <br /> <br />means, `deliver me from him, because I am innocent of his actions,' <br /> <br />وَنَجِّنِي مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and save me from the people who are wrongdoers. <br /> <br />Her name was Asiyah bint Muzahim, may Allah be pleased with her. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 10" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التحريم<span class="num-ar">66</span> :<span class="num-ar">11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tahrim<span> 66</span>:<span>11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Lima Tuharrim, Al-Mutaharrim, Surat An-Nabi</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 12" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
