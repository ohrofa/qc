They will say (yaqlna&#59; this denotes the beginning of a new [syntactically independent] sentence), `Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, towards Paradise -- whereas the hypocrites, their light will be extinguished -- and forgive us, Our Lord. Assuredly You have power over all things'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحًا <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! <br /> <br />meaning, a true, firm repentance that erases the evil sins that preceded it and mend the shortcoming of the repenting person, encouraging and directing him to quit the evil that he used to do. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّيَاتِكُمْ <br /> <br />وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاَْنْهَارُ <br /> <br />It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, <br /> <br />And when Allah says, &#34;it may be,&#34; it means He shall. <br /> <br /> <br />يَوْمَ لَا يُخْزِي اللَّهُ النَّبِيَّ وَالَّذِينَ امَنُوا مَعَهُ <br /> <br />the Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him. <br /> <br />meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not disgrace those who believed in the Prophet, <br /> <br />نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِمْ <br /> <br />Their light will run forward before them and in their right hands. <br /> <br />as we explained in Surah <b>Al-Hadid</b>, <br /> <br />يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They will say&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Our Lord! Keep perfect our light for us and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things.&#34; <br /> <br />Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri and other said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is the statement that the believers will say on the Day of Resurrection, when they witness the light of the hypocrites being extinguished.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that a man from the tribe of Banu Kinanah said, <br /> <br />&#34;I prayed behind the Messenger of Allah during the year of the Conquest (of Makkah), and heard him say, <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ لَا تُخْزِنِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />O Allah! <br /> <br />Please, do not disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection.'</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 7" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التحريم<span class="num-ar">66</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tahrim<span> 66</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Lima Tuharrim, Al-Mutaharrim, Surat An-Nabi</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 9" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
