When one sees disobedience, he stops them and forbids them from doing it.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ad-Dahhak and Muqatil; <br /> <br />&#34;It is an obligation for the Muslim to teach his near family members, and his male and female slaves what Allah has made obligatory for them and what Allah has forbidden for them.&#34; <br /> <br />There is a Hadith that confirms the meaning of this Ayah. <br /> <br />Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ar-Rabi` bin Sabrah said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مُرُوا الصَّبِيَّ بِالصَّلَةِ إِذَا بَلَغَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ فَإِذَا بَلَغَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ فَاضْرِبُوهُ عَلَيْهَا <br /> <br />Order the children to pray when they reach the age of seven and when they reach the age of ten, discipline them for (not performing) it. <br /> <br />This is the narration that Abu Dawud collected; <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;This Hadith is <b>Hasan</b>.&#34; <br /><b>Fuel for Hell and a Description of its Angels</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ <br /> <br />whose fuel is men and stones, <br /> <br />indicating that the Children of Adam will be fuel for the Fire that will feed it, <br /> <br />وَالْحِجَارَةُ <br /> and stones, in reference to the idols that were worshipped, just as Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ <br /> <br />Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (21&#59;98) <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Mujahid, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir and As-Suddi said that these are sulfur stones that are more putrid than rotten corpses, according to Mujahid. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />عَلَيْهَا مَلَيِكَةٌ غِلَظٌ شِدَادٌ <br /> <br />over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, <br /> <br />means, their nature of behavior is stern, because the mercy has been taken out of their hearts for those who disbelieve in Allah, <br /> <br />شِدَادٌ <br />severe, meaning, their structure is powerful, strong and frightening, <br /> <br />لَاا يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَا أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُوْمَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />who disobey not the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded. <br /> <br />meaning, whatever Allah commands them, they rush to obey Him, without delay for even a twinkling of an eye. They are able to fulfill the command; they are called <b>Az-Zabaniyah</b>, meaning, the keepers and guards of Hell, may Allah give us shelter from them. <br /><b>No Excuse will be accepted from the Disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَاا تَعْتَذِرُوا الْيَوْمَ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 5" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التحريم<span class="num-ar">66</span> :<span class="num-ar">6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tahrim<span> 66</span>:<span>6</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Lima Tuharrim, Al-Mutaharrim, Surat An-Nabi</span></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 7" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=66,sura_dir="at-tahrim",count_ayat=12,number_aya=6;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
