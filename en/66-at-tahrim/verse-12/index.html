Allah commanded him to blow into a gap of her garment and that breath went into her womb through her private part; this is how `Isa was conceived. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br /> <br />فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِنَا <br /> <br />وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّهَا وَكُتُبِهِ <br /> <br />And We breathed into it through Our <b>Ruh</b>, and she testified to the truth of her Lords <b>Kalimat</b>, and His <b>Kutub</b>, <br /> <br />meaning His decree and His legislation. <br /> <br />وَكَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَانِتِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and she was of the <b>Qanitin</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah drew four lines on the ground and said, <br /> <br />أَتَدْرُونَ مَا هَذَا <br /> <br />Do you know what these lines represent? <br /> <br />They said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَفْضَلُ نِسَاءِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ خَدِيجَةُ بِنْتُ خُوَيْلِدٍ وَفَاطِمَةُ بِنْتُ مُحَمَّدٍ وَمَرْيَمُ ابْنَةُ عِمْرَانَ وَاسِيَةُ بِنْتُ مُزَاحِمٍ امْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْن <br /> <br />The best among the women of Paradise are <br /> <br />- Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, <br /> <br />- Fatimah bint Muhammad, <br /> <br />- Maryam bint `Imran and <br /> <br />- Asiyah bint Muzahim, wife of Fir`awn. <br /> <br />It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />كَمُلَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ كَثِيرٌ وَلَمْ يَكْمُلْ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلاَّ اسِيَةُ امْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَرْيَمُ ابْنَةُ عِمْرَانَ وَخَدِيجَةُ بِنْتُ خُوَيْلِدٍ وَإِنَّ فَضْلَ عَايِشَةَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ كَفَضْلِ الثَّرِيدِ عَلَى سَايِرِ الطَّعَام <br /> <br />Many men have reached the level of perfection, but none among women have reached this level except <br /> <br />- Asiyah -- Fir`awn's wife, <br /> <br />- Maryam--the daughter of `Imran, and <br /> <br />- Khadijah--the daughter of Khuwaylid. <br /> <br />And no doubt, the superiority of `A'ishah to other women is like the superiority of <b>Tharid</b> to other meals. <br /> <br />In my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I have mentioned these Hadiths using their various chains of narration in relating the story of Prophet `sa and his mother Maryam, peace be upon them, all praise be to Allah. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>At-Tahrim</b>, all thanks and praise are due to Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah At-Tahrim Verse 11" href="/en/66-at-tahrim/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> التحريم<span class="num-ar">66</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">At-Tahrim<span> 66</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi"> Lima Tuharrim, Al-Mutaharrim, Surat An-Nabi</span></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
