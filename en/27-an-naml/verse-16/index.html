Rather what is meant is the inheritance of kingship and Prophethood, for the wealth of the Prophets cannot be inherited, as the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الاَْنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ مَا تَرَكْنَاهُ فَهُوَ صَدَقَة <br /> <br /> <br />We Prophets cannot be inherited from; whatever we leave behind is charity. <br /> <br />وَقَالَ <br /> <br />And (Suleiman) said&#59; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ الطَّيْرِ وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ <br /> <br />O mankind! We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything. <br /> <br />Here Suleiman was speaking of the blessings that Allah bestowed upon him, by giving him complete authority and power, whereby mankind, the Jinn and the birds were subjugated to him. <br /> <br />He also knew the language of the birds and animals, which is something that had never been given to any other human being -- as far as we know from what Allah and His Messenger told us. <br /> <br />Allah enabled Suleiman to understand what the birds said to one another as they flew through the air, and what the different kinds of animals said. <br /> <br />Suleiman said&#59; <br />عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ الطَّيْرِ وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ <br /> (We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything). <br /> <br />i.e., all things that a king needs. <br /> <br />إِنَّ هَذَا لَهُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْمُبِينُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This, verily, is an evident grace. <br /> <br />means, `this is clearly the blessings of Allah upon us.' <br /> <br />وَحُشِرَ لِسُلَيْمَانَ جُنُودُهُ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِْنسِ وَالطَّيْرِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 15" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-15/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النمل<span class="num-ar">27</span> :<span class="num-ar">16</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Naml<span> 27</span>:<span>16</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 17" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-17/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
