Eventually they killed the she-camel and were about to kill Salih too. They plotted to let him sleep with his family at night, then they would assassinate him and tell his relatives that they knew nothing about what happened to him, and that they were telling the truth because none of them had seen anything. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَكَانَ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ <br /> <br />And there were in the city, <br /> <br />meaning, in the city of <b>Thamud</b>, <br /> <br />تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ <br /> <br />nine <b>Raht</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, nine people, <br /> <br />يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الاَْرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />who made mischief in the land, and would not reform. <br /> <br />They forced their opinions on the people of <b>Thamud</b>, because they were the leaders and chiefs. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;These were the people who killed the she-camel,&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning, that happened upon their instigation, may Allah curse them. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَنَادَوْاْ صَـحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَى فَعَقَرَ <br /> <br />But they called their comrade and he took (a sword) and killed (the she-camel).

(91&#59;12) <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Yahya bin Rabi`ah As-San`ani told them, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard `Ata' -- i.e. Ibn Abi Rabah -- say&#59;<b> <br />وَكَانَ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ <br /> <br />تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الاَْرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ <br /></b> (And there were in the city nine <b>Raht</b>, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform), <br /> <br />`They used to break silver coins.&#34;' <br /> <br />They would break off pieces from them, as if they used to trade with them in terms of numbers (as opposed to weight), as the Arabs used to do. <br /> <br />Imam Malik narrated from Yahya bin Sa`id that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Cutting gold and silver (coins) is part of spreading corruption on earth.&#34; <br /> <br />What is meant is that the nature of these evil disbelievers was to spread corruption on earth by every means possible, one of which was that mentioned by these Imams</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 47" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النمل<span class="num-ar">27</span> :<span class="num-ar">48</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Naml<span> 27</span>:<span>48</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 49" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=27,sura_dir="an-naml",count_ayat=93,number_aya=48;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
