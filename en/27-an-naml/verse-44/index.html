Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it, she supposed it to be a pool, of water, and so she bared her legs, to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace [hallway], and he saw that her legs and feet were [in fact] fair. He said, to her&#59; `It is a hallway paved [smooth] with crystal', and thereafter he called her to submit [to God]. She said, `My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, by worshipping other than You, and I submit with Solomon to God, the Lord of the Worlds'. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a [depilatory] lime mixture (nra) and she removed it therewith. He married her and had [great] love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month, staying for three days [every time]. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 -- Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>قِيلَ لَهَا ادْخُلِي الصَّرْحَ فَلَمَّا رَأَتْهُ حَسِبَتْهُ لُجَّةً وَكَشَفَتْ عَن سَاقَيْهَا <br /> <br />It was said to her&#59;&#34;Enter <b>As-Sarh</b>&#34; but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs. <br /> <br />Suleiman had commanded the <b>Shayatin</b> to build for her a huge palace of glass beneath which water was flowing. Anyone who did not know the nature of the building would think that it was water, but in fact there was a layer of glass between a person walking and the water. <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّهُ صَرْحٌ مُّمَرَّدٌ مِّن قَوَارِيرَ <br /> <br />He (Suleiman) said&#59;&#34;Verily, it is a <b>Sarh Mumarrad</b> of <b>Qawarir</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />means a palace or any lofty construction. <br /> <br />Allah says of Fir`awn -- may Allah curse him -- that he said to his minister Haman&#59; <br /> <br />ابْنِ لِى صَرْحاً لَّعَـلِّى أَبْلُغُ الاٌّسْبَـبَ <br /> <br />Build me a <b>Sarh</b> that I may arrive at the ways. (40&#59;36-37) <br /><b>Sarh</b> is also used to refer to the high constructed palaces in Yemen. <br /><b>Mumarrad</b> means sturdily constructed and smooth. <br /> <br />مِّن قَوَارِيرَ <br /> <br />of <b>Qawarir</b>, <br /> <br />means, made of glass, i.e., it was built with smooth surfaces. <br /><b>Marid</b> is a fortress in Dawmat Al-Jandal. What is meant here is that Suleiman built a huge, lofty palace of glass for this queen, in order to show her the greatness of his authority and power. When she saw for herself what Allah had given him and how majestic his position was, she submitted to the command of Allah and acknowledged that he was a noble Prophet, so she submitted to Allah and said&#59; <br /> <br />قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي <br /> <br />She said&#59;My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, <br /> <br />meaning, by her previous disbelief and <b>Shirk</b> and by the fact that she and her people had worshipped the sun instead of Allah. <br /> <br />وَأَسْلَمْتُ مَعَ سُلَيْمَانَ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and I submit, together with Suleiman to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. <br /> <br />meaning, following the religion of Suleiman, worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, Who created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 43" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النمل<span class="num-ar">27</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Naml<span> 27</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 45" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
