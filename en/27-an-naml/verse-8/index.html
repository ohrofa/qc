Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation. <br /> <br />يَا مُوسَى إِنَّهُ أَنَا اللَّهُ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 7" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-7/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النمل<span class="num-ar">27</span> :<span class="num-ar">8</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Naml<span> 27</span>:<span>8</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 9" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-9/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=27,sura_dir="an-naml",count_ayat=93,number_aya=8;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
