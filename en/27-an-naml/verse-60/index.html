And He created the earth, with its varying heights and densities, and He created everything in it, mountains, hills, plains, rugged terrain, wildernesses, crops, trees, fruits, seas and animals of all different kinds and colors and shapes, etc. <br /> <br />وَأَنزَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاء مَاء <br /> <br />and sends down for you water from the sky, <br /> <br />means, He sends it as a provision for His servants, <br /> <br />فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ حَدَايِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ <br /> <br />whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight <br /> <br />means, beautiful and delightful to behold. <br /> <br />مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنبِتُوا شَجَرَهَا <br /> <br />It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. <br /> <br />meaning, `you are not able to cause their trees to grow. The One Who is able to do that is the Creator and Provider, Who is doing all this Alone and Independent of any idol and other rival.' <br /> <br />The idolators themselves admitted this, as Allah says in another <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَيِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ <br /> <br />And if you ask them&#59;&#34;Who has created them!&#34; they will certainly say&#59;&#34;Allah.&#34; (31&#59;25) <br /> <br />وَلَيِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَأءِ مَأءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّه <br /> <br />And if you were to ask them&#59;&#34;Who sends down water from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death!&#34; they will surely reply&#59;&#34;Allah.&#34; (29&#59;63) <br /> <br />Meaning they will admit that He is the One Who does all these things, Alone, with no partner or associate, but then they worship others alongside Him, others who they admit cannot create or provide anything. But the Only One Who deserves to be worshipped is the Only One Who can create and provide, <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَإِلَهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />Is there any god with Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, `is there any god that can be worshipped alongside Allah, when it is clear to you and anyone who with reason that He is the Creator and Provider, as you yourselves admit!' <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)! <br /> <br />meaning, they describe others as being equal and comparable to Allah</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 59" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> النمل<span class="num-ar">27</span> :<span class="num-ar">60</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">An-Naml<span> 27</span>:<span>60</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah An-Naml Verse 61" href="/en/27-an-naml/verse-61/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=27,sura_dir="an-naml",count_ayat=93,number_aya=60;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
