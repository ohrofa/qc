According to Ibn Zayd, it means a sand dune; and according to Ikrimah, it means a mountain or a cave. <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;We were informed that <b>`Ad</b> was a tribe in Yemen. They dwelt among sand (hills), and overlooked the sea in a land called Ash-Shihr.&#34; <br /> <br />Under the chapter, &#34;He Who supplicates should first mention Himself,&#34; Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />يَرْحَمُنَا اللهُ وَأَخَا عَاد <br /> <br />May Allah have mercy on us and the Brother of <b>`Ad</b>. <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />وَقَدْ خَلَتْ النُّذُرُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ <br /> <br />And surely, warners had already passed on before him and after him. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah had sent Messengers and warners to the towns surrounding the land of <b>`Ad</b>. <br /> <br />This is similar to Allah's saying, <br /> <br />فَجَعَلْنَـهَا نَكَـلً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا <br /> <br />And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded them. (2&#59;66) <br /> <br />And it is also similar to Allah's saying, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُواْ فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَـعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَـعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ إِذْ جَأءَتْهُمُ الرُّسُلُ مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />But if they turn away, then say&#59;&#34;I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck <b>`Ad</b> and <b>Thamud</b>. (That occurred) when the Messengers had come to them from before them and after them (saying)&#59;&#34;Worship none but Allah.&#34; (41&#59;13-14) <br /> <br />أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوا إِلاَّ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />&#34;Worship none but Allah; <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />إِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day. <br /> <br />meaning, <b>Hud</b> said this to them (his people), and they responded to him saying</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 20" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-20/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">21</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>21</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 22" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-22/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
