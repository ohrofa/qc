By that, they made a great and obvious error, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَكَذلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولواْ أَهَـوُلاءِ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَأ <br /> <br />Thus have We tried some of them with others, that they might say&#59;&#34;Is it these whom Allah has favored from among us?&#34; (6&#59;53) <br /> <br />meaning, they wonder how could those weaklings be the ones who were guided from among them. <br /> <br />Thus, Allah says, <br />لَوْ كَانَ خَيْرًا مَّا سَبَقُونَا إِلَيْهِ <br /> (Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!) <br /> <br />Contrary to this is the position of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah&#59;They say about any act or saying that has not been reported from the Companions&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It is an innovation. If there was any good in it, they would have preceded us in doing it, because they have not left off any of the good characteristics except that they hurried to perform them.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah continues, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُوا بِهِ <br /> <br />And when they have not been guided by it, (meaning, the Qur'an). <br /> <br />فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَذَا إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />they say&#59;&#34;This is an ancient falsehood!&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, an old lie. They mean by this that the Qur'an has been quoted and taken from the ancient people, thereby belittling the Qur'an and its followers. This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس <br /> <br />(Arrogance is) rejecting the truth and belittling the people. <br /> <br />Allah then says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 10" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-10/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">11</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>11</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 12" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-12/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
