Rather, He commanded them&#59;&#34;Be,&#34; and they were, without any refusal or delay. They obeyed and responded to Him with submission and fear. <br /> <br />This is similar to what Allah said elsewhere, <br /> <br />لَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br />Verily, the creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of the people. But most people do not know.
