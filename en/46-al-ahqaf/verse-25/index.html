(51&#59;42) <br /> <br />meaning, like something dilapidated (or decrepit). Because of this, <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />فَأَصْبَحُوا لَاأ يُرَى إِلاَّ مَسَاكِنُهُمْ <br /> <br />So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings! <br /> <br />means, all of them were destroyed, and none of them were spared. <br /> <br />Allah then says&#59; <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي الْقَوْمَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thus do We recompense the criminal people! <br /> <br />which means that this is Our judgement regarding those who reject Our Messengers and disobey Our commands. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said, <br /> <br />&#34;I never saw Allah's Messenger fully laughing so that I would see his uvula. He would only smile.&#34; <br /> <br />She added that when Allah's Messenger saw clouds or wind, that would reflect on his face (as discomfort). She asked him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;O Allah's Messenger! When the people see clouds, they become happy, hoping that they bring them rain. But I notice that when you see them, displeasure appears on your face.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger replied, <br /> <br />يَا عَايِشَةُ مَا يُوْمِنُنِي أَنْ يَكُونَ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ قَدْ عُذِّبَ قَوْمٌ بِالرِّيحِ وَقَدْ رَأَى قَوْمٌ الْعَذَابَ وَقَالُوا هذَا عَارِضٌ مُمْطِرُنَا <br /> <br />O `A'ishah! What would guarantee to me that they do not bring punishment Some nations had been punished with wind. On seeing the punishment approaching them, a nation once said&#59;&#34;This is a cloud bringing us rain.&#34; <br /> <br />This is also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that when Allah's Messenger saw clouds on any of the horizons, he would leave whatever he was doing -- even if he was in prayer -- and say&#59; <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا فِيه <br /> <br />O Allah! I seek refuge with you from any harm that it (the cloud) contains. <br /> <br />If Allah removed those clouds, the Prophet would praise Allah, and if rain fell, he would say&#59; <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ صَيِّبًا نَافِعًا <br /> <br />O Allah! Make it pouring and beneficent. <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded in his Sahih from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that when the wind blew, Allah's Messenger would say, <br /> <br />اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا فِيهَا وَخَيْرَ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِهِ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا وَشَرِّ مَا فِيهَا وَشَرِّ مَا أُرْسِلَتْ بِه <br /> <br />O Allah! I ask You of its good, the good that it contains, and the good with which it has been sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that it contains, and the evil with which it has been sent. <br /> <br />She added that if the sky became cloudy, his color would change; he would exit, enter, come, and go. <br /> <br />When it rained, his anxiety would be relieved. <br /> <br />When A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, noticed that, she asked him about it and he said&#59; <br /> <br />لَعَلَّهُ يَا عَايِشَةُ كَمَا قَالَ قَوْمُ عَادٍ <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضًا مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُوا هَذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا <br /> <br /> <br />O `A'ishah! It could be like what the people of <b>`Ad</b> said, <br /> <br />(Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said&#59;&#34;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&#34;) <br /> <br />We have previously mentioned the story of the destruction of the people of <b>`Ad</b> in both Surah <b>Al-A`raf</b> and Surah <b>Hud</b>. Thus, there is no need to repeat it here; and verily Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 24" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-24/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">25</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>25</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 26" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-26/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
