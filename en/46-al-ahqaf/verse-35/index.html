And do not seek to hasten [it] for them, for your people, the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he [the Prophet] seemed [by this stage] to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them, which is why he was enjoined to [exercise] patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement [for them] -- for it would befall them [eventually] without doubt. It shall seem for them, on the day when they see what they are promised, of chastisement in the Hereafter, given its long duration, as though they had tarried, in this world, by their reckoning, only an hour of a day. This Qur'n is, a communication, a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed, that is to say, none [shall be destroyed] upon seeing the chastisement, but the immoral folk?, that is to say, the disbelieving [folk].

And give them respite for a little while. (73&#59;11) <br /> <br />فَمَهِّلِ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْهِلْهُمْ رُوَيْداً <br /> <br />So allow time for the disbelievers, and leave them for a while. (86&#59;17) <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّن نَّهَارٍ <br /> <br />On the Day when they will see that which they are promised, it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except an hour in a day. <br /> <br />Which is similar to Allah's saying, <br /> <br />كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا <br /> <br />On the Day they see it (the Hour), it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except for a day's afternoon or its morning. (79&#59;46) <br /> <br />and as He says, <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />And on the Day when He shall gather them together, (it will be) as if they had not stayed but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other. (10&#59;45) <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />بَلَغٌ <br /> <br />A clear message. <br /> <br />meaning, this Qur'an provides a clear concept. <br /> <br />فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people. <br /> <br />Which means that Allah does not destroy anyone except those who choose the way of destruction. It is part of Allah's justice that He does not punish anyone except those who deserve the punishment -- and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />This concludes the explanation of Surah <b>Al-Ahqaf</b>. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Both success and protection from faults are by His help</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 34" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-34/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">35</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>35</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=46,sura_dir="al-ahqaf",count_ayat=35,number_aya=35;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
