He describes the success and salvation He has prepared for them. Here He connects to that discussion the situation of the wretched offspring who are undutiful toward their parents. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي قَالَ لِوَالِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَا <br /> <br />But he who says to his parents&#59;&#34;<b>Uff</b> to you!&#34; <br /> <br />As for the saying &#34;<b>Uff</b>&#34; in this Ayah, it is a general description applying to anyone who says it to his parents. Some people claim that it was revealed about Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr. But this claim is weak and rejected, because Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr embraced Islam after this was revealed. His adherence to Islam was excellent, and he was among the best of his contemporaries. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded from Yusuf bin Mahak that; <br /> <br />Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) was governor of Hijaz (Western Arabia), appointed by Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. He (Marwan) delivered a speech in which he mentioned Yazid bin Mu`awiyah and urged the people to give a pledge of allegiance after his father. Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said something to him in response to that, upon which Marwan commanded his men&#59;&#34;Arrest him!&#34; But he entered Aishah's house, and they were not able to capture him. Marwan then said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This is the one about whom Allah revealed&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي قَالَ لِوَالِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَا أَتَعِدَانِنِي أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِي <br /> <br />But he who says to his parents&#59;&#34;<b>Uff</b> to you! Do you promise me that I will be raised -- when generations before me have passed?&#34; <br /> <br />From behind the curtain, Aishah responded&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Allah did not reveal any Qur'an in our regard (i.e. the children of Abu Bakr), except for the declaration of my innocence.&#34; <br /> <br />In another report recorded by An-Nasa'i, Muhammad bin Ziyad reported that; <br /> <br />when Mu`awiyah was soliciting people to pledge allegiance to his son, and Marwan declared&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This follows the tradition of Abu Bakr and `Umar.&#34; <br /> <br />On hearing this, Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said&#59;&#34;Rather, this is the tradition of Heraclius and Caesar.&#34; <br /> <br />Marwan responded&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This is the one about whom Allah revealed, <br />وَالَّذِي قَالَ لِوَالِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَا <br /> (But he who says to his parents&#59;&#34;<b>Uff</b> to you!&#34;)&#34; <br /> <br />When that was conveyed to A'ishah, she said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Marwan is lying! By Allah, that was not revealed about him. If I wish to name the person meant by it, I could. On the other hand, Allah's Messenger placed a curse on Marwan's father (Al- Hakam bin Abi Al-`As when Marwan was still in his loins, so Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) is an outcome of Allah's curse.&#34; <br /> <br />As for Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />أَتَعِدَانِنِي أَنْ أُخْرَجَ <br /> <br />Do you promise me that I will be raised? <br /> <br />meaning, resurrected. <br /> <br />وَقَدْ خَلَتْ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِي <br /> <br />when generations before me have passed, <br /> <br />meaning, generations of people have already passed away, and none of them has ever returned to tell (what happened to them) . <br /> <br />وَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />While they invoke Allah for help, <br /> <br />meaning, they ask Allah to guide him, and they say to their son, <br /> <br />وَيْلَكَ امِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقّفَيَقُولُ مَا هَذَا إِلاَّ أَسَاطِيرُ الاَْوَّلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;Woe to you! Believe! <br /> <br />Verily, the promise of Allah is true.&#34; <br /> <br />But he says&#59;&#34;This is nothing but the legends of the ancient.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ فِي أُمَمٍ <br /> <br />قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِْنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا خَاسِرِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 16" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-16/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">17</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>17</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 18" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-18/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
