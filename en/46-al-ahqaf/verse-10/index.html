Salm, to the like of it, that is to say, to it [the Qur'n], that it is from God, and he, the witness, has believed [in it], while you act with arrogance ...', you are disdainful of faith (the response to the conditional [`if ...'] is given [by implication] in what has been supplemented to it, in other words&#59; `Would you not then be [considered] wrongdoers?'; this [understanding of the response] is indicated by [what follows]). Truly God does not guide wrongdoing folk'.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3><span>24</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p><b>The Qur'an is Allah's True Speech and the Position of the Disbelievers and the Muslims towards it</b> <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />قُلْ <br /> <br />Say, <br /> <br />meaning, `O Muhammad to these idolators who disbelieve in the Qur'an.' <br /> <br />أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ <br /> <br />Tell me! If it was, (meaning, this Qur'an). <br /> <br />مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ <br /> <br />from Allah, and you disbelieved in it, <br /> <br />meaning, `what do you think that Allah will do to you if this Book that I have come to you with is actually revealed to me from Him in order that I convey it to you, and yet you disbelieve in it and deny it <br /> <br />وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ <br /> <br />عَلَى مِثْلِهِ <br /> <br />(at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar, <br /> <br />meaning, `the previous Scriptures that were revealed to the Prophets before me all testify to its truthfulness and authenticity. They have prophecied, well in advance, about things similar to that which this Qur'an informs of.' <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَأمَنَ <br /> <br />and believed, <br /> <br />`this person who testified to its truthfulness from the Children of Israel, due to his realization that it was the truth.' <br /> <br />وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ <br /> <br />while you rejected (the truth)! <br /> <br />`whereas you have arrogantly refused to follow it.' <br /> <br />Masruq said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;That witness believed in his Prophet and Book, while you disbelieved in your Prophet and Book.&#34; <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. <br /> <br />The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam. <br /> <br />This is similar to the statement of Allah, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَأ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ <br /> <br />And when it is recited to them, they say&#59;&#34;We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, even before it we have been Muslims.&#34; (28&#59;53) <br /> <br />It is also similar to Allah's saying, <br /> <br />قُلْ ءَامِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُوْمِنُواْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلٌّذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا <br /> <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَأ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً <br /> <br /> <br />Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it -- when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration, <br /> <br />and they say&#59;&#34;Exalted is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.&#34; (17&#59;107-108) <br /> <br />It has been narrated from Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;I have not heard Allah's Messenger say about anyone walking on the surface of the earth that he is of the people of <b>Jannah</b> -- except for Abdullah bin Salam.
