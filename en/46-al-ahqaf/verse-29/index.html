(72&#59;19)&#34; <br /> <br />Sufyan said, &#34;They stood on top of each other like piled wool.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad was alone in recording this. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah's Messenger never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, <br /> <br />`We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' <br /> <br />Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' <br /> <br />Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the <b>Fajr</b> prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said&#59; <br /> <br />`By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' <br /> <br />Then they returned to their people and told them&#59; <br /> <br />`Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' <br /> <br />So Allah revealed to His Prophet, <br /> <br />قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ <br /> <br />Say&#59;It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an). (72&#59;19) <br /> <br />Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that; <br /> <br />the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah. When they heard him, <br />قَالُوا أَنصِتُوا <br /> (They said&#59;&#34;Listen quietly.&#34;) meaning, hush! <br /> <br />They were nine in number, and one of them was called Zawba`ah. So Allah revealed, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَا إِلَيْكَ نَفَرًا مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْانَ <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُوا أَنصِتُوا فَلَمَّا قُضِيَ وَلَّوْا إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ <br /> <br />And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said&#59;&#34;Listen quietly!&#34; And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners. until His saying&#59; <br />ضَلَلٍ مُّبِينٍ <br /> manifest error. (Ayah 29-32) <br /> <br />Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. <br /> <br />As for Allah's saying, <br /> <br />وَلَّوْا إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />they returned to their people as warners. <br /> <br />It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger. <br /> <br />This is similar to Allah's saying, <br /> <br />لِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ <br />that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil). (9&#59;122) <br /> <br />This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى <br /> <br />And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities. (12&#59;109) <br /> <br />And Allah says, <br /> <br />وَمَأ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ <br /> <br />And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets. (25&#59;20) <br /> <br />And He says about Ibrahim <b>Al-Khalil</b>, upon him be peace, <br /> <br />وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ <br />And We placed in his descendants Prophethood and Scripture. (29&#59;27) <br /> <br />Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. <br /> <br />As for Allah's saying in Surah <b>Al-An`am</b>, <br /> <br />يَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ <br /> <br />O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you? (6&#59;130) <br /> <br />It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. <br /> <br />This is like Allah's saying, <br /> <br />يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلوْلُوُ وَالمَرْجَانُ <br /> <br />From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and <b>Marjan</b>. (55&#59;22) <br /> <br />Although He said &#34;both of them&#34; this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). <br /> <br />Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says</p></div></div></article></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 28" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-28/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الأحقاف<span class="num-ar">46</span> :<span class="num-ar">29</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Ahqaf<span> 46</span>:<span>29</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Ahqaf Verse 30" href="/en/46-al-ahqaf/verse-30/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=46,sura_dir="al-ahqaf",count_ayat=35,number_aya=29;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/theme.js?v9"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/dist/data/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
