Surely, when the donkey carries books, it will not understand what these books contain because it is only carrying these books using its strength. <br /> <br />This is the example of those who were entrusted with the <b>Tawrah</b>; they read its letter but did not understand its meanings nor abided by them. Rather, they even corrupted and changed the <b>Tawrah</b>. Therefore, they are worse than the donkey, because the donkey cannot understand. They, on the other hand, could have understood using their minds, but their minds were of no benefit. <br /> <br />This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ كَالَانْعَـمِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـيِكَ هُمُ الْغَـفِلُونَ <br /> <br />They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless. (7&#59;179), <br /> <br />and said, <br /> <br />بِيْسَ مَثَلُ الْقَوْمِ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِأيَاتِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ لَاا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayat of Allah? And Allah does not guide the people who are wrongdoers. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ هَادُوا إِن زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاء لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Jumu&#39;a Verse 4" href="/en/62-al-jumu-a/verse-4/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> الجمعة<span class="num-ar">62</span> :<span class="num-ar">5</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Jumu'ah<span> 62</span>:<span>5</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Jumu&#39;a Verse 6" href="/en/62-al-jumu-a/verse-6/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
