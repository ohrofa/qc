(10&#59;78) <br /> <br />فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْلَكِينَ <br /> <br />So they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed. (23&#59;48) <br /><b>The Rebellious do not believe in Miracles</b> <br /> <br />Allah says here&#59; <br /> <br />أَوَلَمْ يَكْفُرُوا بِمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَى مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old! <br /> <br />Did not mankind disbelieve in those mighty signs which were given to Musa! <br /> <br />قَالُوا سِحْرَانِ تَظَاهَرَا <br /> <br />They say&#59;&#34;Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!&#34; <br /> <br />cooperating or working one with the other. <br /> <br />وَقَالُوا إِنَّا بِكُلٍّ كَافِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And they say&#59;&#34;Verily, in both we are disbelievers.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, `we disbelieve in each of them.' Because of the close relationship between Musa and Harun, mention of one includes the other. <br /><b>False Accusation that Musa and Harun (peace be upon them both) practiced Magic</b> <br /> <br />Mujahid bin Jabr said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Jews told Quraysh to say this to Muhammad, then Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />`Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old! They say&#59;Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!' <br /> <br />This refers to Musa and Harun, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both, <br />تَظَاهَرَا <br /> (each helping the other) i.e., working together and supporting one another.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Razin that the phrase &#34;two kinds of magic&#34; referred to Musa and Harun. <br /> <br />This is a good suggestion. <br /> <br />And Allah knows best. <br /><b>The Response to this False Accusation</b> <br /> <br />About the <b>Ayah</b> <br />سِحْرَانِ تَظَاهَرَا <br /> (Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!) Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;this refers to the <b>Tawrah</b> and the <b>Qur'an</b>, because Allah says next&#59; <br /> <br />قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِكِتَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَا أَتَّبِعْهُ <br />. <br /> <br />Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it... <br /> <br />قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَابَ الَّذِي جَاء بِهِ مُوسَى نُورًا وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيرًا وَعُلِّمْتُم مَّا لَمْ تَعْلَمُواْ أَنتُمْ وَلَا ابَاوُكُمْ قُلِ اللّهُ ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِي خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />وَهَـذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ <br /> <br />Say &#59;&#34;Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to mankind which you (the Jews) have made into (separate) paper sheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing much. And you were taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew.&#34; <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;Allah (sent it down).&#34; <br /> <br />Then leave them to play in their vain discussions. <br /> <br />And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, (6&#59;91-92) <br /> <br />And at the end of the same Surah, Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ ءاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ تَمَامًا عَلَى الَّذِى أَحْسَنَ <br /> <br />Then, We gave Musa the Book, to complete (Our favor) upon those who would do right. (6&#59;154) <br /> <br />وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ <br /> <br />And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah, that you may receive mercy. (6&#59;155) <br /> <br />And the Jinn said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ <br /> <br />Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it. (46&#59;30) <br /> <br />Waraqah bin Nawfal said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is <b>An-Namus</b>, who came down to Musa.&#34; <br /> <br />And those who are possessed of insight know instinctively that among the many Books which He has sent down to His Prophets, there is no Book more perfect, more eloquent or more noble than the Book which He revealed to Muhammad, which is the Qur'an. <br /> <br />Next to it in status and greatness is the Book which Allah revealed to Musa bin Imran, which is the Book concerning which Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّأ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَـبِ اللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَاءَ <br /> <br />Verily, We did send down the <b>Tawrah</b>, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests, for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto. (5&#59;44) <br /> <br />The <b>Injil</b> was revealed as a continuation and complement of the <b>Tawrah</b> and to permit some of the things that had been forbidden to the Children of Israel. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِكِتَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَا أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 47" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-47/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">48</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>48</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 49" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-49/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please support us by making a donation</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - Qur'an Online</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
