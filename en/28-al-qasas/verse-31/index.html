It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. <br /> <br />When he saw that&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَّى مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ <br /> <br />he turned in flight, and looked not back. <br /> <br />he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him&#59; <br /> <br />يَا مُوسَى أَقْبِلْ وَلَاا تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الاْامِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />O Musa! Draw near, and fear not.
