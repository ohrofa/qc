Concerning the phrase, <br />قَالَ إِنَّمَا أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِي <br /> (He said&#59;&#34;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#34;) He said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Were it not for the fact that Allah is pleased with me and knows my virtue, He would not have given me this wealth.&#34; <br /> <br />And He said&#59; <br /> <br />أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ القُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعًا <br /> <br />Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected! <br /> <br />This is what those who have little knowledge say when they see a person whom Allah has granted a lot of wealth; they say that if he did not deserve it, Allah would not have given it to him. <br /> <br />وَلَا يُسْأَلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But the criminals will not be questioned of their sins</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 77" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-77/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">78</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>78</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 79" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-79/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=28,sura_dir="al-qasas",count_ayat=88,number_aya=78;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
