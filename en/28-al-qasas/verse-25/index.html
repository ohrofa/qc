He accepted her invitation, while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage, for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it [which he was not]. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs, he said to her, `Walk behind me and show me the way', which she did. Finally he came to her father, Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him, `Sit and have some supper'. He [Moses] said, `I hope that this is not [some sort of] compensation for having watered [their flock] for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds'. He [Shu`ayb] said, `No. It is [simply] a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food'. Thus, he [Moses] ate and informed him of his predicament. God, exalted be He, says&#59; So when he came to him and recounted to him the story (al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqss, `that which is recounted'), of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh, he [their father] said, `Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people', as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian.</p></div></div></article><article id="tafsiribnkathir" class="ac-item "><a class="ac-link" href="#tafsiribnkathir"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a><h3 class="ac-title" aria-selected="false" aria-expanded="false"><span>27</span> Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><div class="ac-content" aria-hidden="true"><div class="ac-content-inner"><p><b>Musa, the Father of the Two Women, and His Marriage to One of Them</b> <br /> <br />When the two women came back quickly with the sheep, their father was surprised that they returned so soon. He asked them what had happened, and they told him what Musa, peace be upon him, had done. So he sent one of them to call him to meet her father. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَجَاءتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِي عَلَى اسْتِحْيَاء <br /> <br />Then there came to him one of them, walking shyly. <br /> <br />meaning, she was walking like a free woman, as it was narrated from the Commander of the faithful, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;She was covering herself from them with the folds of her garment.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Maymun said, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;She came walking shyly, putting her garment over her face. She was not one of those audacious women who come and go as they please.&#34; <br /> <br />This chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِي يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا <br /> <br />She said&#59;&#34;Verily, my father calls you that he may reward you for having watered (our flocks) for us.&#34; <br /> <br />This is an example of good manners&#59;she did not invite him directly lest he have some suspicious thoughts about her. Rather she said&#59;&#34;My father is inviting you so that he may reward you for watering our sheep,&#34; i.e., give you some payment for that. <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاءهُ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الْقَصَصَ <br /> <br />So when he came to him and narrated the story, <br /> <br />means, he told him about his story and why he had to leave his country. <br /> <br />قَالَ لَاا تَخَفْ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />he said&#59;&#34;Fear you not.
