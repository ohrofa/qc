But he was an illiterate man who could not read books, and he grew up among a people who knew nothing of such things. Similarly, Allah told him about Maryam and her story, as Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلَـمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ <br /> <br />You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam; nor were you with them when they disputed, (3&#59;44), <br /> <br />meaning, `you were not present then, but Allah has revealed this to you.' <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah told him about Nuh and his people, and how He saved Nuh and drowned his people, then He said&#59; <br /> <br />تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَأءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَأ إِلَيْكَ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَأ أَنتَ وَلَا قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـذَا فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ الْعَـقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ <br /> <br />This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So, be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. (11&#59;49) <br /> <br />And at the end of the same Surah (<b>Hud</b>) Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَأءِ الْقُرَى نَقُصُّهُ عَلَيْكَ <br /> <br />That is some of the news of the towns which We relate unto you. (11&#59;100) <br /> <br />And here, after telling the story of Musa from beginning to end and how Allah began His revelation to him and spoke with him, <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِيِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَا إِلَى مُوسَى الاَْمْرَ <br /> <br />And you were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Musa the commandment, <br /> <br />meaning, `you -- O Muhammad -- were not on the western side of the mountain where Allah spoke to Musa from the tree which was to the east of it, in the valley.' <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنتَ مِنَ الشَّاهِدِينَ <br /> <br />and you were not among the witnesses. <br /> <br />`to that event, but Allah has revealed this to you,' <br /> <br />so that it may be evidence and proof of events which happened centuries ago, for people have forgotten the evidence that Allah established against them and what was revealed to the earlier Prophets.</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 43" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-43/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">44</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>44</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 45" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-45/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
