So they said to Fir`awn, &#34;If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it.&#34; So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. <br /> <br />Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. <br /> <br />Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. <br /> <br />When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. <br /> <br />No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى <br /> <br />And I endued you with love from Me. (20&#59;39) <br /><b>Musa, peace be upon him, in the House of Fir`awn</b> <br /> <br />When Musa's mother became so worried and confused, it was inspired into her heart and mind what she should do, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِي الْيَمِّ وَلَاأ تَخَافِي وَلَاأ تَحْزَنِي إِنَّا رَادُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَاعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And We inspired the mother of Musa (telling)&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Suckle him, but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers.&#34; <br /> <br />Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom. <br /> <br />Allah says</p></div></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="panel" id="panel-2"><div class="panel-body"><p>And We revealed, by inspiration or in a dream, to the mother of Moses -- who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth -- `Suckle him, then, when you fear for him, cast him into the waters, namely, the Nile, and do not fear, that he should drown, or grieve, for being separated from him, for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers'. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside.
