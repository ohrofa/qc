Indeed he was of those who cause corruption, through [the use of] slaughter and otherwise.</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ عَلَ فِي الاَْرْضِ <br /> <br />Verily, Fir`awn exalted himself in the land, <br /> <br />means, he was an arrogant oppressor and tyrant. <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ أَهْلَهَا شِيَعًا <br /> <br />and made its people <b>Shiya`</b>, <br /> <br />means, he made them into different classes, each of which he used to do whatever he wanted of the affairs of his state. <br /> <br />يَسْتَضْعِفُ طَايِفَةً مِّنْهُمْ <br /> <br />weakening a group among them. <br /> <br />This refers to the Children of Israel, who at that time were the best of people, even though this tyrant king overpowered them, using them to do the most menial work and forcing them to hard labor night and day for him and his people. <br /> <br />يُذَبِّحُ أَبْنَاءهُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيِي نِسَاءهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />weakening a group among them&#59;killing their sons, and letting their females live. Verily, he was of the mischief-makers. <br /> <br />At the same time, he was killing their sons and letting their daughters live, to humiliate them and because he feared that there might appear among them the boy who would be the cause of his destruction and the downfall of his kingdom. So Fir`awn took precautions against that happening, by ordering that all boys born to the Children of Israel should be killed, but this precaution did not protect him against the divine decree, because when the term of Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, and for each and every matter there is a decree from Allah. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُوا فِي الاَْرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَيِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 3" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-3/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">4</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>4</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 5" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-5/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
