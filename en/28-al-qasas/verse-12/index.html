Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she, his sister, said, `Shall I show you a household -- having seen their affection for him -- who will take care of him for you, by having him suckled and so on, and who will act in good faith towards him?' (the [suffixed] pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king, as a response to them [when they asked Mary how she could be sure]). Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her [breast] because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him, just as God, exalted be He, says&#59;</p></div><div id="tafsiribnkathir"><h3>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</h3><p>وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />And We had already forbidden foster suckling mothers for him, <br /> <br />Because of his honored status with Allah, it was forbidden by divine decree. It was decreed that no one should nurse him except his own mother, and Allah caused this to be the means reuniting him with his mother so that she could nurse him and feel safe after having felt such fear. When (his sister) saw that they were confused over who should nurse the child, <br /> <br />فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَاصِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />she said&#59;&#34;Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and look after him in a good manner'!' <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />When she said that, they had some doubts about her, so they seized her and asked her, How do you know these people will be sincere and will care for him?&#34; <br /> <br />She said to them, &#34;They will be sincere and will care for him because they want the king to be happy and because they hope for some reward.&#34; <br /> <br />So they let her go. After what she said, being safe from their harm, they took her to their house and brought the baby to his mother. She gave him her breast and he accepted it, so they rejoiced and sent the glad tidings to the wife of Fir`awn. <br /> <br />She called for Musa's mother, treating her kindly and rewarding her generously. She did not realize that she was his real mother, but she saw that the baby accepted her breast. Then Asiyah asked her to stay with her and nurse the baby, but she refused, saying, &#34;I have a husband and children, and I cannot stay with you, but if you would like me to nurse him in my own home, I will do that.&#34; <br /> <br />The wife of Fir`awn agreed to that, and paid her a regular salary and gave her extra gifts and clothing and treated her kindly. The mother of Musa came back with her child, happy that after a time of fear Allah granted her security, prestige, and ongoing provision. <br /> <br />There was only a short time between the distress and the way out, a day and night, or thereabouts -- and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Glory be to the One in Whose hands are all things; what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. He is the One Who grants those who fear Him, a way out from every worry and distress, <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 11" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-11/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">12</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>12</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 13" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-13/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
