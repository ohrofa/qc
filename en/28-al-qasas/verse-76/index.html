When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.&#34; <br /> <br />Other views were also given, and Allah knows best. <br /> <br />إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لَا تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Remember when his people said to him&#59;&#34;Do not exult.
