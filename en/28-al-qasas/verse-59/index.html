(6&#59;92) <br /> <br />قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.&#34; (7&#59;158) <br /> <br />لااٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ <br /> <br />That I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach. (6&#59;19) <br /> <br />وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ <br /> <br />but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place. (11&#59;17) <br /> <br />وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا <br /> <br />And there is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a severe torment. (17&#59;58) <br /> <br />Allah tells us that He will destroy every town before the Day of Resurrection, as He says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً <br /> <br />And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger. (17&#59;15) <br /> <br />Allah has sent the Unlettered Prophet to all the towns (all of mankind), because he has been sent to the Mother of Cities, their source to which they all return. <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الاَْحْمَرِ وَالاَْسْوَد <br /> <br />I have been sent to the red and the black. <br /> <br />Prophethood ended with him, and there is no Prophet or Messenger to come after him, but his way will remain as long as night and day remain, until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah also tells that&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كُنَّا مُهْلِكِي الْقُرَى إِلاَّ وَأَهْلُهَا ظَالِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And never would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are wrongdoers</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 58" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-58/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">59</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>59</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 60" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-60/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
