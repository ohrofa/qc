So Allah made it taste extreme hunger (famine) and fear, because of what they did. <br /> <br />There has come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment seized them while they were wrongdoers. (16&#59;112-113) <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَتِلْكَ مَسَاكِنُهُمْ لَمْ تُسْكَن مِّن بَعْدِهِمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً <br /> <br />And those are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them except a little. <br /> <br />Their land became empty and desolate, and you can see nothing but their dwellings. <br /> <br />وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ الْوَارِثِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And verily, We have been the heirs. <br /> <br />Their towns became ruins, with none remaining. <br /> <br />Then Allah tells us of His justice and that He does not destroy anyone unjustly; on the contrary, He destroys those whom He destroys after establishing proof against them. <br /> <br />So, he says</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 57" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-57/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> القصص<span class="num-ar">28</span> :<span class="num-ar">58</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Al-Qasas<span> 28</span>:<span>58</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Al-Qasas Verse 59" href="/en/28-al-qasas/verse-59/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins id="footer-ins"></ins><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script>var page_type="ayah",sura_id=28,sura_dir="al-qasas",count_ayat=88,number_aya=58;</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/site.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
