He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, &#34;O Adam, are you fleeing from me!&#34; <br /> <br />When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, &#34;No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah replied, &#34;Yes.&#34; <br /> <br />This is the meaning of Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him. (2&#59;37) <br /> <br />However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this <b>Hadith</b> from Ubayy. <br /> <br />It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ <br /> <br />And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَعَصَى ادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَى <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ثُمَّ اجْتَبَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَى</p></div></div></div></article><div class="navigation"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="li-left"><a title="Surah Ta-Ha Verse 120" href="/en/20-ta-ha/verse-120/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-left"></i></a></li><li class="li-center rtl"><small><span lang="ar">القرآن الكريم</span> -<span lang="ar"> طه<span class="num-ar">20</span> :<span class="num-ar">121</span></span><br/><span class="ltr bdi" lang="id">Ta Ha<span> 20</span>:<span>121</span></span><br/></small></li><li class="li-right"><a title="Surah Ta-Ha Verse 122" href="/en/20-ta-ha/verse-122/"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="featured_2" class="featured"></div></main><footer class="row footer"><ins><a href="/donate/" class="button button-primary" lang="en">Donate</a><p class="help"><small lang="en">Please donate to keep this site alive</small></p></ins><p>&copy; <ins id="copyright-year" class="no-underline"></ins> <a href="https://qurano.com">qurano</a>.com - <b>Q</b>ur'an <b>O</b>nline</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a lang="en" href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a lang="en" href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/dist/js/jquery.min.js?v.1.11.2"><\/script>')</script><script src="/dist/js/main.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function () {superSearch({searchFile: "/quran-en.xml"});});</script></body></html>
